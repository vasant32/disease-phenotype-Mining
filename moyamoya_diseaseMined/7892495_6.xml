<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To improve CT number reproducibility in helical CT, a newly developed controlled-orbit helical scan mechanism was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors developed a method for volumetric measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF) with dynamic helical computed tomography (CT) after inhalation of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> gas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In three subjects (two healthy men aged 22 and 38 years and a 7-year-old girl with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>), six helical scans were obtained during 6-minute <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> inhalation, and CT scans with 41 sections in 2-mm increments were reconstructed from each scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conventional CBF calculation was then applied to the CT images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CBF maps of 40 sections for each subject of sufficient diagnostic quality were obtained with a 39-cGy radiation dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The spatial resolution was 2.5 line pairs per centimeter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This volumetric CBF mapping method is applicable in clinical practice because of the short examination time and acceptable radiation dose </plain></SENT>
