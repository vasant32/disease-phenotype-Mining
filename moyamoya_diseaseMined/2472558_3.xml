<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Regional cortical blood flow (rCBF) was measured with a thermal diffusion flow probe in 14 cortical regions of 12 young patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> before and after completion of superficial temporal-middle cerebral artery anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prebypass rCBF value was low in most patients, especially in the frontal regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On temporary occlusion of the cortical artery during the surgical procedure, no significant drop in rCBF occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>rCBF increased immediately after anastomosis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one region and continued to increase for 5-10 minutes in four of the eight regions measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the other four regions, rCBF declined gradually after the initial increase, and the final increase was slight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average increase in rCBF was significant at 1-2 minutes and at 5-10 minutes after anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the latter increase did not bring the flow into the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It may be that the initial increase in postbypass rCBF is determined solely by the pressure gradient between the donor and recipient arteries, and that subsequent rCBF is controlled by other factors within the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In one patient who underwent double anastomoses to the frontal and temporal lobes, neither anastomosis increased rCBF in the non-corresponding lobe to recipient artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that there is no direct connection between supra- and infra-Sylvian arteries and supports the concept of nonuniform epicerebral microcirculation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
