<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The pattern of infarctions based on the findings of diffusion-weighted image was assessed, and it was also investigated whether there are any age-specific differences in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects were 66 consecutive patients with MMD who had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each ischaemic lesion was categorised into one of seven patterns (gyral, atypical territorial, honeycomb, classic territorial, multiple-dot, borderzone, deep lacunar) based on diffusion-weighted image findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patterns were compared between adulthood-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> MMD (A-MMD, â‰¥20 years old, 34 patients) and childhood/adolescent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> MMD (C-MMD, &lt;20 years old, 32 patients) according to their ages of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 91 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patterns were observed from 66 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The gyral, atypical territorial, and honeycomb patterns, which are not usually seen in conventional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, were common in MMD (68.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patterns, a gyral pattern was most common (40/91, 44.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Borderzone and deep lacunar patterns were infrequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Gyral and borderzone patterns were more frequently seen in the C-MMD group, whereas a honeycomb pattern was not seen in young patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Honeycomb pattern was more common at advanced vascular stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Infarctions confined to the cortex were more common in the C-MMD group (26/32, 75.0%) than in A-MMD patients (14/34, 41.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> showed various characteristic and age-specific <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Different <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patterns between the A-MMD and C-MMD groups may be associated with age-specific vulnerability of the brain to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> or changes of abnormal collateral pathways </plain></SENT>
