<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> treated at the University of Washington from 1990 through 2004 (39 patients) were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent pre- and postoperative evaluation of cerebral perfusion dynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgical revascularization procedures were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with impaired cerebral blood flow (CBF) findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of patients at diagnosis was 34 years (range 10-55 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 39 patients had impaired CBF and/or vasomotor reserve and underwent revascularization procedures: 26 patients underwent bilateral operations, 13 unilateral (65 total procedures) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass was technically possible in 56 procedures (86.2%); saphenous vein interposition grafts were required in 3 procedures (4.6%); encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis was performed in 6 procedures (9.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients died due to postoperative complications, yielding a procedure-related mortality rate of 4.61%, and 8 experienced non-life threatening complications (for a procedure-related rate of 12.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up appeared to indicate a reduction in further ischemic events in surviving patients compared with the natural history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cerebral perfusion dynamics improved postoperatively in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 36 surviving patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> may differ in the US and Asia, and STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass procedures may prevent future ischemic events in patients with this condition </plain></SENT>
