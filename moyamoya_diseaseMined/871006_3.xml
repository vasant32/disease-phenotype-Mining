<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After contrast enhancement, no significant increase in the attenuation number was observed in and around the lucent foci except in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In three patients, there was a slight increase in density in the central gray matter, however the increase in density was slight when the dense angiographic vascular networks in the basal ganglia were considered </plain></SENT>
