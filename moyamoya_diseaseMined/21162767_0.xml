<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subjects included 16 patients with BA trunk and branch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> who underwent endovascular treatment in our hospital from October 2000 to October 2009, including four patients with associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>), two with associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, one with multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> at adjacent sites, and one with a distant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endovascular coil embolization, together with stent or balloon assistance when necessary, or while occluding the parent artery was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Associated diseases were managed intraoperatively or in the second stage, or treated with gamma knife radiotherapy, or followed up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients with unsuccessful embolization died of re-rupture at the fourth month and fifth month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining 14 patients reported good outcomes and experienced no re-rupture of either the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> or associated disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiographic follow-ups were conducted for the 14 patients for six to 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) examination at the last follow-up showed no recurrence of the BA trunk and branch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together, BA trunk and branch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> should be actively managed via endovascular techniques to prevent serious consequences due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Favorable outcomes can be obtained by the proper selection of endovascular treatment regimens </plain></SENT>
