<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Simple indirect anastomosis was introduced for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the territory of anterior cerebral arteries (ACAs) or middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi>), and its clinical usefulness was discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 19 patients with childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> who were operated on with subcutaneous tissue graft including a scalp artery and a relevant vein (group 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had repetitive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) in the territory of ACAs or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To compare age, sex, and the time required for the operation, 34 patients with childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> with direct anastomosis were also included in the (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> were observed in 19 of 21 operative sides during the follow-up period in group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining 2 sides continued to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> postsurgically, but with a marked decrease in frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in age and sex between group 1 and group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Required time for surgical procedure in group 1 ranged from 103 to 270 minutes (mean +/- SD, 167.4 +/- 38.8 minutes), and in group 2 from 140 to 320 minutes (215.0 +/- 36.2 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The former was significantly shorter than the latter (unpaired t test, t = 4.8773, P = .000007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous tissue graft including a scalp artery and a relevant vein is recommended for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> presenting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the territory of the ACAs or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
