<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To measure the extent of angiographic revascularization quantitatively 6 months postoperatively with the OSIRIS program (University Hospital of Geneva, version 3.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 75 bypass procedures were performed in 65 consecutive adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> patients, and 71 bypass surgeries in 61 adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> patients were studied 6 months postoperatively with angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed 5 different types of bypass surgeries: encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS), superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis (SMA), SMA with encephalomyosynangiosis (EMS), SMA with EDAS, and SMA with encephaloduroarteriomyosynangiosis (EDAMS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also investigated single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) results after 6 months postoperatively and compared the angiographic revascularization extent with the SPECT results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean values for the extent of revascularization among 5 different bypass surgeries were as follows: 32.4% for EDAS only, 57.4% for SMA only, 58.4% for SMA with EMS, 66.1% for SMA with EDAS, and 70.8% for SMA with EDAMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant difference in the extent of revascularization among the 5 surgical modalities (P = .000) and between the EDAS-only group and various SMA groups (P = .000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis between angiographic revascularization extent and SPECT results demonstrated significant statistical correlation (P = .000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The extent of angiographic revascularization in adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> patients was highest in the SMA with EDAMS group and lowest in the EDAS-only group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, angiographic revascularization extent was well correlated with the change in SPECT </plain></SENT>
