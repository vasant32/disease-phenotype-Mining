<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bilateral basal arteries were measured by the transtemporal approach with a 2 MHz pulsed Doppler instrument (TC-2 64B <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EME</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 28 out of the 34 basal arteries (82.4%), reliable recordings were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) findings were classified into three patterns: (1) High-high pattern; the mean cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) was increased throughout the basal arteries by over 70 cm/s (seven arteries, 25.0%); (2) high-low pattern; the mean CBFV was fastest (over 70 cm/s) at the ICA or proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and the mean CBFV decreased remarkably distally (15 arteries, 53.6%); and (3) low-low pattern; the mean CBFV was less than 40 cm/s throughout the basal arteries (arteries, 15.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These CBFV patterns as assessed by TCD are compared with the patients age, clinical symptoms and angiographical stagings (Suzuki's criteria) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The high-high pattern on TCD was predominantly seen in the younger patients and in the earlier stages of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The high-low pattern was the most common pattern of CBFV as assessed by TCD in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The low-low pattern on TCD was more common in the later stages following angiographic evaluation by Suzuki's criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The above patterns based on TCD findings show a good correlation with the age of the patient and the clinical diagnosis at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TCD appears to be very useful in the evaluation of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
