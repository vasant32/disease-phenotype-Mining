<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (72%) showed excellent results, 7 patients (25%) good and 1 patient (3%) poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Development of collaterals shown on postoperative angiograms was excellent on 20 sides, good on 9 sides, and fair on 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abundant neovascularization was most commonly noted on angiogram in superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery bypass with encephalo-myo-synangiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Encephalo-myo-arterio-synangiosis, devised by the authors, or encephalo-myo-synangiosis alone also produced preferable development of collaterals shown on angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery bypass alone was insufficient for development of neovascularization </plain></SENT>
