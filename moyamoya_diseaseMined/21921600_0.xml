<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to characterize angiographic revascularization effects of a bilateral standardized revascularization approach, consisting of superficial temporal artery (STA)-middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) bypass and encephalomyosynangiosis (EMS) on one hemisphere and single EMS on the contralateral hemisphere of each patient, and to compare the effects of both revascularization strategies on cerebral hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 30 patients (18 females/12 males, age 8-63 years), standardized revascularization was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction angiography was performed preoperatively and at 7 days, 6 months and 12 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and EMS functions were graded I (poor), II (medium) or III (extensive) according to angiographic aspects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 20 patients, cerebrovascular reserve capacity (CVRC) was assessed pre- and postoperatively (at 12 months) using <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 12 months, STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>/EMS function was grade 1 in 40/40%, grade 2 in 27/26%, and grade 3 in 27/10% of hemispheres, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve months after surgery, single EMS showed grade I in 37%, grade II in 27%, and grade III in 20% of hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Combined revascularization improved CVRC significantly compared to preoperative measurement (preoperative: 16.5 ± 34.6% vs. postoperative: 60.8 ± 64.22%; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Single EMS did not improve CVRC significantly (preoperative: 21.8 ± 35.9% vs. postoperative: 34.8 ± 63.0%; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combined and indirect revascularization may be successfully applied in a bilateral standardized approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>/EMS is superior to single EMS in restoring CVRC in adult MMD patients </plain></SENT>
