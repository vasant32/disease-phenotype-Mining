<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Visualization of the lateral view of the common carotid angiography was performed with intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (IA-DSA), using a 4/<z:chebi fb="63" ids="30000">sec</z:chebi> x 3 sec + 2/<z:chebi fb="63" ids="30000">sec</z:chebi> x 5 sec + 1/<z:chebi fb="63" ids="30000">sec</z:chebi> x 5 sec film sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The catheter tip was inserted into C5/6 level and 250 mgI/ml of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31711">iopamidol</z:chebi> was used as the contrast agent; 6 ml in total was injected over 1.5 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Circulation times of the common carotid artery (C3 portion)-ascending parietal vein (delta <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTPs</z:chebi>) and common carotid artery-internal cerebral vein (delta TTPD) were measured before <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> (HV), immediately after HV, and 3 minutes after HV during pre- and postoperative periods. delta TTPD in the preoperative period was prolonged by HV and was normalized at 3 minutes after HV but delta <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTPs</z:chebi> were prolonged immediately after and 3 minutes after HV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the postoperative period, however, these values did not change significantly immediately after and 3 minutes after HV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that delayed cerebral blood flow response to HV is a pathogenetic factor of the re-buildup phenomenon in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
