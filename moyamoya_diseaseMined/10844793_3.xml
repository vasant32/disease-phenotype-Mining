<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study was carried out in 13 hemispheres of seven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (including one atypical patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In MRA, magnetisation transfer contrast (MTC) and maximal intensity projection (MIP) techniques were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A good correspondence between MRA and CCA was noted in 11 hemispheres (86.4%) on evaluating stenotic lesions and overestimation in the remaining 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Underestimation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels in MRA was noted in 3 hemispheres, since well developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels were detectable, while poorly developed ones were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No difference between MRA and CCA findings was found in 10 hemispheres (76.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRA tends to overestimate the stenosis and underestimate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These characteristics may lead to wrong classification in the angiographic grade of patients with early and advanced stages and should be taken into consideration in interpreting MRA images of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (compatible rate of grade between MRA and CCA; 84.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion MRA with MTC and MIP techniques offers an acceptable quality of assessment of stenotic lesions and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MRA is a useful follow up method at present and in the near future it may replace CCA as the initial diagnostic tool </plain></SENT>
