<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report a case of female Caucasian adult twins with similar presentations of bilateral MMD that were treated with different surgical modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One twin was treated with a bypass and remains event free (defined as either transient ischemic event or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) at her 4-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second twin underwent angioplasty to treat a left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> as well as the placement of a Wingspan stent to treat a right supraclinoid ICA stenosis on separate occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The left middle cerebral artery angioplasty thrombosed due to the discontinuation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> resulting in recurrent symptoms, principally <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, and the Wingspan stent underwent angioplasty for in-stent stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite this, the stent has been patent and the patient has remained event free at her 2-year follow-up, post-placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relatively new Wingspan stent has been used in the past for intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp>, however, this is the first report of it being used in a case of MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An overview of the MMD literature in twins and endovascular therapy is given </plain></SENT>
