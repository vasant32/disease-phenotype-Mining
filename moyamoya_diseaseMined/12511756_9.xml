<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The cause of <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> patients is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify factors that contribute to <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, we assessed the angiographic findings of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined angiograms obtained from 107 moyamoya patients; 70 manifested ischemic and 37 had hemorrhagic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with intracerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> or both hemorrhagic and ischemic lesions in the same cerebral hemisphere were not included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into those &lt;20 years of age (n=47) and those &gt; or =20 years of age (n=60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The right and left hemispheres in each patient were individually classified as hemorrhagic, ischemic, or asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each hemisphere was assessed for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and branch extension of the anterior choroidal artery (AChA) and posterior communicating artery (P-CoM) and for the degree of proliferation of basal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data were then statistically analyzed for correlation with <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The degree of proliferation of basal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels was not statistically correlated with hemorrhagic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, there was a correlation between <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and abnormal branching of the AChA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 27 of 37 hemorrhagic hemispheres (73.0%), this artery was dilated, and its abnormal branches served as collateral supply vessels to other regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon was observed in 4 of 5 hemorrhagic hemispheres from young patients; it was noted in fewer than one third of ischemic and asymptomatic hemispheres from this age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Similarly, 71.9% of hemorrhagic hemispheres from adult patients manifested AChA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and branching, and the difference between hemorrhagic hemispheres and those that were ischemic or asymptomatic was statistically significant (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although the incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and abnormal branching of the P-CoM was relatively low in hemorrhagic hemispheres from adult patients (18.8%), it was significantly higher than in the ischemic and asymptomatic hemispheres from this age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Using <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and abnormal branching of the AChA and/or P-CoM as assessment criteria, we obtained high specificity (86.4%) and sensitivity (84.4%) for hemorrhagic events in adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and abnormal branching of the AChA and/or P-CoM are strong predictors of hemorrhagic events </plain></SENT>
