<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In one patient, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) clearly visualized the bilateral EDAS, and 3D-CTA also visualized these anastomoses in detail with extreme clarity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the other two patients, MRA did not clearly demonstrate the right EDAS anastomosis, but 3D-CTA visualized both side surgical collaterals clearly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>External carotid angiography confirmed these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>3D-CTA might have great value in the evaluation of surgical bypass patency and, in following the disease progression </plain></SENT>
