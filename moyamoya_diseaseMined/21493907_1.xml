<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) is an indicator of cerebral hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In adults with cerebrovascular disease, impaired CVR has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In children, however, CVR studies are not common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This may be due to the difficulties and risks associated with current CVR study methodologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have previously described the application of precise control of end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure for CVR studies in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our aim is to report initial observations of CVR studies that were performed as part of a larger observational study regarding investigations in pediatric patients with cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen patients between the ages of 10 and 16 years (10 with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> vasculopathy and 3 with confirmed, or suspected, intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0005412'>vascular stenosis</z:mp>) underwent angiography, MRI, and functional blood oxygen level-dependent MRI mapping of CVR to <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of the CVR study were then related to both the structural imaging and clinical status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen blood oxygen level-dependent MRI CVR studies were performed successfully in 13 consecutive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twelve of the 13 patients with angiographic abnormalities also had CVR deficits in the corresponding downstream vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CVR deficits were also seen in 8 of 9 symptomatic patients and 2 of the asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Notably, in patients with abnormalities on angiography, the reductions in CVR extended beyond the ischemic lesions identified with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> structural imaging into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing brain parenchyma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case series reporting blood oxygen level-dependent MRI CVR in children with cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CVR studies performed so far provide information regarding hemodynamic compromise, which complements traditional clinical assessment and structural imaging </plain></SENT>
