<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined EEG, tcPO2, tcPCO2 and respiratory curves during and after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> in 10 cases of typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the cases, tcPCO2 decreased gradually by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo>, and its level was about 50% of the pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> level at the end of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It took about five minutes for the tcPCO2 level to return to the pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, tcPO2 was increased by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, it decreased down to 50% of the pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> level within a few minutes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> because of the following decrease in the respiratory rate, and it took 5 to 10 minutes to return to the pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sequential changes in tcPCO2 and tcPO2 showed good correlation with the biphasic change in EEG by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The decrease in tcPO2 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> seemed in particular to play an important role in the appearance of re-build up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also examined tcPO2 and tcPO2 during and after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> in 9 cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sequential changes in tcPCO2, tcPO2 and the respiratory rate were the same as those in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e>, but re-build up was not observed </plain></SENT>
