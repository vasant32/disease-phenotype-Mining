<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors describe a modified technique of encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS) with bifrontal encephalogaleoperiosteal synangiosis (EGPS) and present the preliminary results of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between January 2004 and June 2005 the authors performed modified EDAS with bifrontal EGPS in 17 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surgical results were evaluated in terms of clinical outcomes, changes visible on neuroimages, extent of revascularization noted on angiograms, and hemodynamic changes demonstrated on single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period ranged from 6 to 21 months (mean 11.5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall clinical outcomes were excellent or good in 15 patients (88.2%) and poor in two (11.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall morbidity rate was 5.9% (one of 17 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on changes in the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) territories after surgery, as shown on SPECT scans following administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>, 14 patients (82.4%) exhibited an improved vascular reserve capacity in both the ACA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is the authors' opinion that wide covering of the cortex is necessary for sufficient revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the present study they demonstrate that modified EDAS with bifrontal EGPS is a safe and efficient surgical approach that covers not only the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory but also the ACA territory </plain></SENT>
