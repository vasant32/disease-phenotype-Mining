<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is a well known fact that ischemic symptoms are apt to be induced after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> in child case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously noted that characteristic EEG findings are seen after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among these findings, characteristic slow waves which appear after the disappearance or attenuation of ordinary build up have been labelled as "re-build up" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since this phenomenon is highly pathognomonic, we have been evaluating EEG records as an important screening test for childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequential angiograms were taken to understand the nature and pathophysiology of the "re-build up" phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We now report some interesting findings thought to be related to the particular hemodynamics and pathology of childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>Hyperventilation</z:hpo> angiography was performed in 17 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> (7 children, 5 adults whose <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was in childhood and 5 adults) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A control study was performed in 5 patients (one child and 4 adults) who were angiographically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In each patient, the presence or absence of the "re-build up" phenomenon in the EEG was determined within 1 month prior to the angiographical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed prior to 3 minutes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> and in the period of "re-build up" under the same conditions with respect to position, site of the catheter tip, volume and the rate of injected contrast media and timing of angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In control cases and those cases which did not show "re-build up," angiography was performed 1 minute after termination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During examination, serial arterial blood sampling was carried out for blood gas analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In two cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> under inhalation of 8% <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> who showed the "re-build up" phenomenon, angiographical vascular changes such as decrease in the size of basal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> and decrease in the diameter of cortical arteries appeared together with "re-building up." These vascular changes are thought to be closely related to the "re-build up" phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In control cases and adult patients, these findings were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Since these vascular changes did not occur in patients with the "re-build up" phenomenon after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> of 8% <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi>, this phenomenon is thought to be initiated as a direct result of decreased arterial <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> tension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Although during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> PaO2 increased, after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> it decreased significantly while the EEG showed "re-build up".(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
