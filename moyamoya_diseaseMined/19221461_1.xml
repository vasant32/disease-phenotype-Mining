<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SICH) in children is relatively less common as compared to adults, and there are limited studies addressing this issue in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyze the etiology, clinical features, treatment options and outcome assessment in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients of spontaneous intracerebral bleed, aged 18 years and below, were retrospectively analyzed based on medical records and radiographic images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Status of the patient at the final follow-up after discharge was considered as the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age of patients ranged from 2 months to 17 years with higher predilection in males (M:F = 3:2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Presenting features were symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> (70.0%), deterioration in sensorium (50.0%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003690'>limb weakness</z:hpo> (36.0%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>Arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>) was the most common cause of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and was found in 22 patients (44%), followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> in 17 cases (34%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in 3 cases (6%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527390" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intracranial tumor</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e> and unknown cause (possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>) were each found in 2 patients (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment modalities consisted of: excision of <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping, embolization, superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> excision, <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> evacuation and conservative management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients (74%) had good outcome and 13 patients had poor outcome (26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysm</z:hpo> is an important cause of SICH, alongside <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>, which is the leading cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thorough investigation is necessary to elucidate the cause of bleed, which may otherwise be missed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cerebellar bleed and late presentation were found to be associated with poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Age was not found to be associated with outcome </plain></SENT>
