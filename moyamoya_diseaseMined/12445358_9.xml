<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (PWI) tracks the passage of a bolus of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> contrast material through brain tissue and is reflective of cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe the characteristics of PWI in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> and present in detail the PWI findings of a patient studied before and after surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 24-year-old woman presented with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> during a period of 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography disclosed findings consistent with bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PWI showed a striking contrast in perfusion between the anterior and posterior circulations, with relative hyperperfusion in the posterior fossa and marked hypoperfusion in the hemispheric deep white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar findings are reported in five other patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differences in time-to-peak measurements between the pons and the cerebral hemispheres ranged between 2 and 10 seconds, with the greatest difference seen in the two patients with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: The patient underwent a left encephalomyosynangiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One year later, she showed significant improvement in neurological function, and a repeat PWI study showed marked improvement in perfusion of the left hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the growth of small vessels into the brain from the surgical site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PWI demonstrates characteristic patterns of cerebral perfusion in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and documents improved perfusion after successful surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Quantitative analysis of the difference of time-to-peak measurements between the anterior and posterior circulation may be a marker of the severity of the disease </plain></SENT>
