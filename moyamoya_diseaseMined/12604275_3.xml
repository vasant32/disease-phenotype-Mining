<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three cases were diagnosed as quasi-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient was diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these four patients, three patients showed marked transdural leptomeningeal anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed certain areas of hypoperfusion with impairment of the perfusion reserve in the affected areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis (EDAS) unilaterally and were followed up for 1-5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients showed improvement of hemodynamic status, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom showed spontaneously developed leptomeningeal anastomosis in the preoperative angiographies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two of these three patients, well-developed collateral formation from the graft was observed angiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We speculated that in addition to impaired cerebral perfusion reserve, spontaneously developed leptomeningeal anastomosis might be the key factor for the efficacy of indirect bypass in elderly patients with occlusive/stenotic cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
