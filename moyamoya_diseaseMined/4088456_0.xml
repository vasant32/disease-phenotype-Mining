<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> with arterio-venous malformation is not found out on the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper, a rare case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> accompanied by arterio-venous malformation is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient is a 33-year-old male who developed transient left motor <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and visual disturbance on September 5, 1983 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He was admitted to our hospital on October 3, 1983 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On admission, there were no abnormal neurological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plain CT scan showed low density area in the left parietooccipital cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Enhanced CT scan revealed a ribbon-shaped enhanced area in the right temporooccipital cortex and spotty enhanced area in the right frontal subcortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiogram was a typical angiogram of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, namely, stenosis of the terminal portions of both internal carotid arteries and basal, ethmoidal and vault <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the basis of Suzuki's angiographical classification the patient was diagnosed as being in stage III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interesting was that a right carotid angiogram revealed an arterio-venous malformation fed by basal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels and drained to Trolard and Sylvian veins in the right frontal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This arterio-venous malformation consisted with feeders, nidus and drainers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The size of arterio-venous malformation was about 8 X 11 X 12 mm on the angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Another interesting fact was that Trolard vein which was one of the draining veins of the arterio-venous malformation flows into the right parietal vault <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels as if it was feeding the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels </plain></SENT>
