<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The preoperative and postoperative cerebral angiograms, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images, and clinical records of 13 children treated with pial synangiosis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After synangiosis, 10 patients had significant neurologic improvement and three had minimal or no improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images showed no new infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Well-developed (grade A or B) transpial or transdural collaterals to the brain were present at the site of synangiosis in 84% of the surgically treated hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular occlusive changes increased postoperatively in 76% of hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After synangiosis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> collaterals were increased in 48%, unchanged in 16%, and decreased in 36% of surgically treated hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 10 patients with grade A or B collaterals bilaterally after synangiosis were asymptomatic or improved on follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pial synangiosis typically results in an increase in collaterals from the superficial temporal artery or middle meningeal artery to the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Synangiosis appears to result in stabilization or improvement in neurologic symptoms but does not prevent the angiographic progression of disease or the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> collaterals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The angiographic demonstration of well-formed collaterals after synangiosis is associated with a favorable clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
