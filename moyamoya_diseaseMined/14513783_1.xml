<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, a 36-year-old female required ipsilateral direct anastomosis for failed right fronto-temporo-parietal combined indirect bypass procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One of the frontal branches of the right superficial temporal artery (STA) was left intact between the other frontal branch and a parietal branch of the right STA, both of which had been used in the indirect anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The intact STA was used for direct anastomosis, and craniotomy was performed between the two craniotomy sites of the first operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methods of the direct anastomosis for the failed indirect anastomosis should be discussed in each patient who requires vascular reconstruction for failed indirect anastomosis </plain></SENT>
