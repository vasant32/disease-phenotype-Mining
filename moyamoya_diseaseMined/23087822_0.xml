<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The incidence of symptomatic hyperperfusion syndrome after superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) approaches 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most cases, hyperperfusion occurs in a localized area and disappears within 1-2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: A 59-year-old female diagnosed with asymptomatic MMD for 4 months became rapidly symptomatic with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After left STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis surgery, she developed symptomatic hyperperfusion, initially (1-2 weeks after surgery) manifesting with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and lesions located in the left basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She then developed (2-5 weeks after surgery) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> and right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> caused by new hyperperfusion lesions located in the left frontal area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At discharge (7 weeks after surgery), she recovered fully without any remaining neurologic deficit and no ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This report details a rare case of a patient with MMD who presented with regionally progressive hyperperfusion lesions after STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis and symptoms that persisted for 5 weeks following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results from this case suggest that regional differences exist in the functional recovery of cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapidly progressive</z:hpo> MMD </plain></SENT>
