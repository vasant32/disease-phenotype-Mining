<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on 3 otherwise healthy children aged 8, 12 and 15 years who presented with focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> secondary to intracranial carotid occlusive disease consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 2 cases this was precipitated by strenuous physical exertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The protean angiographic configuration included long tapered narrowing with focal stenosis, beaded narrowing with Moya Moya vascular network and 'string sign'; occlusion of the anterior cerebral artery was always present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control angiograms revealed complete or partial recanalization in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases suggesting self-healing dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical course was smooth in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and at long-term follow-up (5, 3, and 2 years) they remain in good neurological condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although intracranial carotid dissection has a poor reputation, regression to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and fair outcome may sometimes occur as in the extracranial counterpart, suggesting the existence of benign forms of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgical procedures should be weighed against the spontaneous resolution of the lesion </plain></SENT>
