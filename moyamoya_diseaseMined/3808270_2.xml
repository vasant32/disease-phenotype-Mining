<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors present a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> associated with pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 32-year-old woman who was at 32 weeks of gestation experienced sudden severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography revealed an intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> in the left temporal lobe, and left carotid angiograms revealed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent emergency craniotomy, the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> was removed, and encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient showed good recovery and, 2 months later, delivered a child vaginally without any trouble </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhages</z:hpo> during pregnancy result from <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>), and few cases due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is generally believed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> is likely to occur during the middle trimester of gestation, with the risk increasing progressively toward the third trimester </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This may be explained by the fact that the cardiac output increases rather acutely from the first to the middle trimester </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There seems to be no significant correlation between the stage of pregnancy and the occurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> due to <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most authors think that the operative indications for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> during pregnancy should be the same as for the nonpregnant state </plain></SENT>
