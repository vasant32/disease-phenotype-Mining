<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: With ongoing advancements in noninvasive vascular imaging and high-throughput genomics, we have the opportunity to reclassify the cerebrocervical disorders by these shared associations, rather than their downstream events, and to better understand etiology, mechanism and preventive treatments going forward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: The common nonatherosclerotic, large-vessel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathies</z:e> affecting the cerebrovasculature include <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>, cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissection</z:e>, fibromuscular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Together, these entities contribute to a high incidence of devastating cerebrovascular outcomes, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, leading to long-term physical and cognitive disability frequently in young otherwise healthy adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to well reported clinical overlap, these polygenic phenotypes share epidemiological characteristics, environmental risk and a common pathological weakening of the arterial wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: We reviewed both past and present studies relating these shared associations, including reported candidate gene analyses and genome-wide association data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also catalogue recent descriptions of novel arteriopathic syndromes that add to the growing list of monogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disease</z:e> affecting the arterial wall, and further inform our understanding of more common polygenic phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also place these cerebrocervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathies</z:e> in the context of other systemic nonatherosclerotic, large-vessel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> (e.g. <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> and dissection) </plain></SENT>
