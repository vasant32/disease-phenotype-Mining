<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>When technically feasible, the preferred revascularization procedure in patients with adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> is a superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The caliber of the STA has been reported as a prognostic factor for a successful bypass, with smaller-caliber STA being more likely to fail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a novel approach to this circumstance in which preoperative embolization of external carotid artery (ECA) branches is used to augment blood flow through a small STA as a prelude to bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report 2 cases: a 42-year-old female presenting with symptomatic ischemic and radiographically progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and a 23-year-old female presenting with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> secondary to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative angiography demonstrated small-caliber STAs in each case, and primary revascularization was deemed difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preoperative ECA embolization was undertaken to shunt blood toward the STA, thereby increasing its flow and caliber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both cases, angiography after embolization demonstrated a 20%-45% increase in STA size, and doppler ultrasound indicated a 14%-50% increase in flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, both patients underwent successful STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass combined with encephalomyosynangiosis without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 167 STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypasses performed by the senior author, embolization was performed in 7 unique patients on 9 sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ECA embolization may be a beneficial adjunct when considering a direct bypass in the setting of a small STA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It can increase blood flow through the STA, making the operation technically easier and enhancing the patency of the bypass </plain></SENT>
