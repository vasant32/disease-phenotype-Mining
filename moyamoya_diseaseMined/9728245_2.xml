<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analysed five pairs of siblings (6 boys, 4 girls) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> from among 56 moyamoya patients less than 15 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 56 paediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, 5 were sibling pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were under 10 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations in the proband and the affected sibling tended to present as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e>; none of the 10 patients presented with intracranical haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The probands were not always the older sibling, however, the time lapse between disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in the proband and his/her sibling was less than one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the sibling pairs, there was no striking difference in disease staging based on angiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of sibling occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> appears to be higher than previously assumed and the family of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> should be cautioned that their other children have an increased risk of developing the illness </plain></SENT>
