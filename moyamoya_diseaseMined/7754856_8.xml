<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ninety-nine craniotomies were performed in these patients, and eight peri-operative complications (four infarctions, two haemorrhagic infarctions and two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0553690" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rind|RIND">reversible ischaemic neurological deficits</z:e> without a new lesion) were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the eight haemodynamic complications arose in the initially affected hemispheres regardless of the side of operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some nonsurgical haemodynamic risk factors, i.e., <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>/hypovolaemia, were noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the eight cases, although the statistical analysis could not clarify the relevance of such factors to peri-operative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgical factors which might be responsible for the complications were noted in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sparing vital collateral vessels and minimum brain retraction as well as avoidance of non-surgical haemodynamic risk factors are considered to be essential to prevent peri-operative haemodynamic brain damage in adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
