<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, a technique of indirect anastomosis using a split dura is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At surgery, the dura near the branches of the middle meningeal artery was split into outer and inner layers, and the split surface of the outer layer was attached to the cortical surface (split duro-encephalo-synangiosis; split DES) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This procedure, combined with standard encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis, was applied to 25 hemispheres in 18 patients with pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> (mean age, 6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postoperative superselective angiograms demonstrated effective cortical revascularization through the dural arteries in addition to the supply from the scalp arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were symptom free by 1.5 years after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0553690" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rind|RIND">reversible ischemic neurological deficit</z:e> and infarction were seen in three (12%) and one (4%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 12 years (mean, 6.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of 16 (81%) patients led <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lives and three were mildly handicapped due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> that existed preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The split DES is a useful technique to extend the area of revascularization of ischemic hemispheres in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
