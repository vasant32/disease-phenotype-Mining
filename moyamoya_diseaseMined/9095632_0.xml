<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Latissimus dorsi muscle is harvested with thoracodorsal vessels after completion of craniotomy and exposure of superficial temporal vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The size of muscle belly which is harvested is dependent on the area where the revascularization is necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microvascular anastomoses of superficial temporal vessels and thoracodorsal vessels are performed in end-to-end fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 31-year-old male patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> was treated by this method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperative angiography demonstrated successful revascularization in the affected hemisphere, with improved perfusion reserve capacity shown by cerebral blood flow study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This type of encephalo-myo-synangiosis (with free muscle flap) is a possible method when vascular reconstruction of an extensive ischemic area which involves anterior and posterior cerebral artery territories is needed in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> or other similar ischemic conditions </plain></SENT>
