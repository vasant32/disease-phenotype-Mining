<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The angiographic stage (Suzuki's stage) was compared between childhood and adulthood, ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and female and male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the angiographic stage was not very different, but was significantly shifted from stage III to stage IV in adult cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The angiographic stage in patients with hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was not significantly different from those with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between females and males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiographic change is not very remarkable between pediatric and adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The angiographic stage does not directly correlate with the distinct clinical presentations between pediatric and adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other factors such as cerebral blood flow demand and arteriosclerotic change seem to cause these differences </plain></SENT>
