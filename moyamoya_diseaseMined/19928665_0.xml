<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in Europe is lower than in Asia and its clinical course in European population is probably different from Asiatic (older <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> and rare incidence of hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORTS: Two young patients were diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> on the basis of clinical symptoms (ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) and results of brain vessels' angiography, which documented an occlusion of both internal carotid arteries above branching-off the ocular arteries in the first patient and stenosis of distal internal carotid arteries and proximal medial and anterior cerebral arteries in the second one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both patients are under control of the Neurological Outpatient Department and their neurological state is stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> is a rare cause of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, it should be always considered as one of etiologic factors, especially in young patients </plain></SENT>
