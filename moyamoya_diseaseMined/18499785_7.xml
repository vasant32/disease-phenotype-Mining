<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively assessed quantitative cerebrovascular reserve by using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> (ACZ)-challenged CT perfusion for evaluating hemodynamic impairment in ischemic adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> and compared it with angiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen adult patients with ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> and 12 age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects underwent both ACZ-challenged CT perfusion and digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Normalized baseline hemodynamic parameters and their percent changes (PCs) were calculated in 56 hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We classified the degrees of distal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> according to modified Suzuki stage and determined the presence of basal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> vessels (BMVs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The values of normalized parameters and their PCs were compared with angiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Normalized baseline mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) and PC of normalized cerebral blood flow (CBF) were significantly correlated with angiographic stages in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the vascular territories; however, the correlation coefficient of the normalized baseline <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> was lower than that of the PC of CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the external borderzone and the middle cerebral arterial territory, the hemispheres with extensive BMVs exhibited significantly lower PC values of CBF and significantly higher normalized baseline <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> values than those in hemispheres with diminished BMVs and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Among the hemodynamic parameters measured by ACZ-challenged CT perfusion, the PC of CBF correlated highly significantly with angiographic stage; however, the normalized baseline CT perfusion parameters showed weak or no significant correlation </plain></SENT>
