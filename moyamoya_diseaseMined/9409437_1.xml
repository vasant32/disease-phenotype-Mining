<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical picture of hemorrhagic type <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> was analyzed in 20 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>Hematoma</z:mp> at the basal ganglia was noted in 40% of cases, <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> (IVH) in 30%, thalamic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> with ventricular rupture in 15% and subcortical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The location was undetermined in two cases (10%) due to <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in the pre-computed tomography (CT) era </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequencies shown above were correlated well to previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 1 year or more after IVH, the primary <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> site was demonstrated at the lateral wall of lateral ventricle, in portion density weighted and T2 weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI can detect the site of old <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> points and its chronological change if the study is repeated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a follow-up period of 6.2 years, 35% of the cases had rebleeding once or twice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The second <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> occurred seven times and the third twice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IVH occurred five times and the most common, basal ganglia <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> three times while thalamic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> once </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As a result, the rate of good outcome was 60% after the first <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and 40% after rebleeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate was 5% after the first 25% after rebleedings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Factors related to rebleedings and their poorer outcome are sex (with women being more susceptible), massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> and early recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Rebleeding worsened the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, prevention of rebleeding is important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>From a therapeutic viewpoint, although a close relation between rebleeding and untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> could not be established, blood pressure control is critical at the both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Bypass surgery for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> seems to be less promising than ischemic type, even though a definite answer may not be obtained from our small number of cases </plain></SENT>
