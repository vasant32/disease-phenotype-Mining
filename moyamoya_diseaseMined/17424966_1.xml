<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a period of ten years, since January 1996, we have encountered seven cases of posterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral artery aneurysms</z:hpo> (0.58% of surgically treated 1027 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in our hospital) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six of these cases were females (from 39 years old to 73 years old, average 54.5 years old) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In five of the cases, neck clippings were performed, using the pterional approach for one P1 and one P2a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, the remaining three were clipping using the subtemporal approach for one P2a and two P2p <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one case diagnosed as "unknown SAH" by typical findings of the CT scan and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> four-vessel study at the time of admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second vertebral angiography (two weeks later) revealed a P2a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such a case attracted our interest in the clinic, because many similar cases might have been diagnosed as "unknown SAH" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the case of a 42-year-old male with intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, four-vessel study made a definite diagnosis as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and revealed a P2a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, which we cured by embolization of GDC for the preservation of anastomosis networks which had already been formed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intravascular embolization is very effective, but sufficient studies are required before applying it in the cases of large and/or thrombosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We described surgical approaches about pterional, subtemporal and transchoroidal approaches and discussed some of the differences in the classification methods of Pia, Yasargil, Zear &amp; Rhoton and Seoane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In particular, attention is necessary because we have confused Yasargil's classification with Zeal &amp; Rhoton's classifications by using of the same notation, "Pn" </plain></SENT>
