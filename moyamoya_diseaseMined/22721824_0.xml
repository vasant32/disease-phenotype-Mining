<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether ASL can be used to detect hyperperfusion after revascularization for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> as effectively as N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-[123I]Î²-iodoamphetamine ((123)I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>) single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent surgical revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured by flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) ASL and (123)I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> SPECT during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage, and rCBF of the operative side was compared with the other side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The asymmetry ratio (AR) was then calculated from the rCBF as measured using each modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The postoperative AR of ASL was moderately correlated with that of (123)I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> SPECT (y = 0.180x + 0.819; R = 0.80; P = .0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this series, 2 patients (13.3%) suffered symptomatic hyperperfusion after revascularization and accordingly exhibited increased AR of ASL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that early increases in rCBF in patients with hyperperfusion could be detected using FAIR ASL supplemental to (123)I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> SPECT after revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that FAIR ASL is a convenient method for evaluating hyperperfusion that can be performed repeatedly without the use of contrast medium or radioisotopes </plain></SENT>
