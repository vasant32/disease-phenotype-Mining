<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five patients with angiographically proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (31 women, 4 men; mean age, 39.4 +/- 12.2 years; range, 15-58 years; adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>) and 15 age-matched healthy controls were examined prospectively with 2D cine phase-contrast MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood volume flow was measured in both common carotid arteries (CCAs), both internal carotid arteries (ICAs), and the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> was based on results of selective intraarterial digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Blood volume flow of the brain-supplying arteries in age-matched controls was 435.6 +/- 47.9 mL/min for the CCA, 254.1 +/- 25.3 mL/min for the ICA, and 173.3 +/- 13.2 mL/min for the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> had decreased mean blood flow in the CCA (309.4 +/- 89.9 mL/min) and ICA (117.9 +/- 64.0 mL/min) and increased blood volume flow in the basilar artery (433.7 +/- 165.9 mL/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> causes a significant decrease in carotid artery circulation, particularly ICA blood volume flow, with a compensatory increase in blood flow in the basilar artery to nearly 2.5 times <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> basilar artery blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>2D cine phase-contrast MRI with measurement of blood volume flow in the brain-supplying arteries is useful in the initial evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and in continuing assessment of hemodynamics in patients with this disease </plain></SENT>
