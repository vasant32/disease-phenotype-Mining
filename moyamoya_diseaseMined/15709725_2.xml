<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The role of cerebral revascularization remains unclear in symptomatic occlusive cerebrovascular disease refractory to medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the disappointing findings of the Cooperative Study on Extracranial-Intracranial Bypass, a subpopulation of patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease and poor hemodynamic reserve may benefit from extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors reviewed the records of 65 patients who underwent 71 EC-IC bypass procedures at their institution over the past 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients except one presented with repeated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) that were referable to the involved vascular region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight patients underwent EC-IC bypass urgently for "crescendo" <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> refractory to antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indications for surgery included cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion in 28, supraclinoid ICA stenosis in two, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> or occlusion in 14, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in 18, and ICA dissection in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography demonstrated poor collateral flow to the involved region in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following EC-IC bypass, the vast majority (95.4%) of patients experienced cessation of their ischemic events and stabilization of preexisting neurological dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the eight patients who underwent EC-IC bypass urgently for crescendo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>, two awoke with increased neurological deficits that improved rapidly within 24 hours of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the Cooperative Study failed to show benefit from this treatment modality, the authors have continued to perform EC-IC bypass in certain cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Carefully selected individuals with occlusive cerebrovascular disease and persistent ischemic symptoms refractory to maximal medical therapy appear to benefit from cerebral revascularization </plain></SENT>
