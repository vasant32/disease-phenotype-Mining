<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 26-year-old woman, who had been suffering <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>), underwent superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis with encephalo-myo-synangiosis (EMS) on the affected hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The (123)I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-SPECT 1 day after surgery demonstrated an improvement of cerebral blood flow (CBF) on the operated hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two days later, however, she suffered fluctuating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> when computed tomography scan revealed marked swelling of the temporal muscle used for EMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The (123)I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-SPECT 4 days after surgery showed significant decrease in CBF by the compression of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then, we performed revision of EMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The base of the temporal muscle was markedly compressed by the edge of the free bone flap, which resulted in swelling of the entire temporal muscle used for EMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We drilled out the edge of the free bone flap for decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Her <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> disappeared postoperatively, and CBF normalized 7 days after the initial surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Her <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> disappeared, and there was no deterioration during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass has been patent since the initial surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Surgical revascularization including EMS has a substantial risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> owing to compression of the brain by temporal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0281913" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">muscle swelling</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Relative wide bone window for temporal muscle insertion is necessary to avoid this rare complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Once the flow compromise is confirmed, we recommend early decompression by the revision of EMS </plain></SENT>
