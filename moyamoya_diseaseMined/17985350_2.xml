<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While blood transfusion therapy is effective primary and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention, the efficacy and acceptance of blood transfusion therapy for children with silent cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall goals of this study were to determine the feasibility and short-term efficacy of blood transfusion therapy for silent cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: We conducted a single-arm feasibility intervention study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Children with SCD and silent cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> received blood transfusion therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Short-term efficacy was defined as no progression of MRI findings on repeat MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten children enrolled in the study, and nine were evaluable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average age was 10.0 years (range 3.1-16.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven of nine completed the transfusion therapy for over 2 years, with an average duration of therapy of 2.7 years (range 1-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and four cases of Moya Moya were present on the initial MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seven of nine subjects had repeat MRIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of these seven, there were a total of 18 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> increased in size and one case of Moya Moya progressed on repeat MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other lesions were stable or became smaller in diameter while on transfusion therapy during the time of follow up (mean 3.9 years, range 2.1-5.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Blood transfusion therapy is a feasible therapy for the prevention of progression of silent cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
