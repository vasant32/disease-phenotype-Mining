<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular disorders are frequent in sickle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They occur mainly in homozygous children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Traditionally, they were believed to result from an arteriolar sickle-cell <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, the "sludge" phenomenon, which is generally responsible for sickle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is now well known that several other kinds of cerebral damages are involved such as moya-moya syndrome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo>, extra-dural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this disease, the identification of these different processes cannot be always made by a simple clinical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, specific therapies are sometimes necessary, such as neurosurgical intervention in the case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, and, according to some authors, the necessity of repeated appropriate transfusions, in the case of moya-moya </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>So it is imperative to carry out without delay a complete neuroradiological assessment of the lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At present, the most widely accepted theory to explain the arteriolar lesions, is that they result from a sickle-cell <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the vasa-vasorum, but, we think it is not the only valid hypothesis and we think that other phenomena may be involved with a genetic factor (patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> may have a particular genotype), and with infectious or autoimmune or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coagulation disorders</z:e>, the latter being frequently observed in this disease </plain></SENT>
