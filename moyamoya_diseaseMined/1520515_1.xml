<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A twelve-year-old girl and a five-year-old boy were admitted to our hospital with the complaints of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> by cerebral angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI clearly presented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> by T2-weighted imaging and multiple small round or tortuous hypo_signal areas around the basal ganglia by proton density weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings were consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels shown by cerebral angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> vessels were visualized more clearly on proton density weighted imaging than on T1-weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
