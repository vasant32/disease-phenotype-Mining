<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The authors' aim in this study was to review their experience in the use of indirect revascularization alone in a series of 14 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, in which numerous bur holes and arachnoid openings were made over each affected hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Revascularization through multiple bur holes and arachnoid openings was performed in 14 children (mean age at diagnosis 6.5 years [range 3-15 years]) who suffered from progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors performed surgery in a total of 24 hemispheres during 18 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten children underwent bilateral multiple bur hole procedures, three underwent a unilateral procedure in the more severely affected hemisphere, and one child had previously undergone an encephaloduroarteriomyosynangiosis on the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten to 24 bur holes were made in the frontotemporoparietooccipital area of each hemisphere, depending on the site and extent of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early postoperative perfusion magnetic resonance imaging studies, performed in the five most recent cases, showed restoration of cortical perfusion as early as 3 months, which was confirmed on subsequent angiography studies (performed between 8 and 12 months postoperatively) that showed excellent revascularization of the ischemic brain by external carotid artery collateral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the children sustained further ischemic attacks postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Motor improvement was noted in those who had presented with <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A single <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> episode occurred in two patients at 2 weeks and 5 months after surgery; both children had presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, and only one complication (an infected lumbar shunt in the patient who required cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] drainage) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five of the 18 procedures were complicated by subcutaneous CSF collections, which resolved with tapping and compressive head dressings; a transient lumbar drain was necessary in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this series suggest that in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> this simple technique is both effective and safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it is effective as a sole treatment without supplementary revascularization procedures </plain></SENT>
