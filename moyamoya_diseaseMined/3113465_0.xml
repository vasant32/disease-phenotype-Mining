<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The method for cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurement using an H215O intravenous injection and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) was implemented, examined and applied to measure cerebrovascular reactivity to PaCO2(VRCO2) and to MABP (VRBP) in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain and in ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immediately after bolus intravenous injection of 30-40 mCi H2(15)O, a time-activity curve of H2(15)O concentration in the arterial blood and in the brain were measured for 60 sec by a beta detector and a PET, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The PET was HEADTOME III and measured five planes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CBF was determined by the table-look up method based on the autoradiographic principle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six volunteers were studied to examine region of VRCO2, and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patient and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patient with a bilateral-intracarotid circulation defect were studied to examine VRCO2 and VRBP in ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The studies were carried out so as to be followed two or three H2(15)O CBF measurements with changing PaCO2 or MABP after control study at rest condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, prior to the H2(15)O study O15 gas steady state study was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Validity of the method examined by simulation studies showed 3% error per 1 sec time shift of the artery curve for 60 sec PET scan duration and the error was rapidly increased to the shorter scan duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inhomogeneity of a brain tissue gave mild under-estimation by 5% for 60 sec PET scan duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>VRCO2 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain was revealed to be almost uniform except that the infratentorium area showed a slight higher VRCO2 than the supratentorium area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ischemic brain showed a negative correlation between VRCO2 and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and a positive correlation between VRBP and OEF </plain></SENT>
