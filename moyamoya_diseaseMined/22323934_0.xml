<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Direct revascularization surgery is regarded as the most effective method of treatment of adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients, however, have a higher risk of perioperative ischemic complications than do patients with atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and are at risk for ischemic complications in the hemisphere contralateral to the one operated on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the incidence and risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the contralateral hemisphere after surgical treatment of adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and results of neuroimaging studies on 79 hemispheres of 73 consecutive patients with adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (mean±SD age, 37.96±11.27 years; range, 18-62 years) who underwent direct bypass surgery over 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ischemic complications occurred in 4 of 79 (5.1%) contralateral hemispheres, one with Suzuki stage 3 and three with Suzuki stage 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients showed posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) involvement by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Advanced stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (Suzuki stages 4/5/6; p=0.001), <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> involvement (p=0.001) and postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (mean arterial blood pressure &lt;80% of preoperative mean arterial blood pressure) on the first (p&lt;0.0001) and second (p=0.003) days after surgery were significantly correlated with postoperative contralateral ischemic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and involvement of the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>, intentional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> can result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the hemisphere contralateral to the one operated on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Careful control of perioperative blood pressure is crucial for good surgical results </plain></SENT>
