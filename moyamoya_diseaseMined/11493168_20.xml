<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> usually presents with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in children and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND OBJECTIVE: We reviewed our experience from June 1995 to August 1999 of 20 adult and pediatric angiographically diagnosed patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> to report their clinical presentation, radiological findings, management, and clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of patients at symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 17 years (range, 2-54 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into 2 age groups (group 1, &lt;18 years; group 2, &gt; or =18 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 13 patients in group 1 and 7 patients in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic strokes</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> were the predominant initial presentations in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient in group 2 had an intraparenchymal brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five patients received medical treatment, and 15 had surgical revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean time from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to surgical procedure was significantly longer for patients in group 1 than for those in group 2 (P =.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up time was 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient in group 1 had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence, mortality, or modified Rankin scale score among medically or surgically treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> may have a different presentation and more benign natural history in our population than in Asian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our findings emphasize the need to better understand the natural history of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> as well as the clinical benefit of different treatment modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Structured multicenter randomized clinical trials are needed to further assess the best treatment modalities for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> in the United States </plain></SENT>
