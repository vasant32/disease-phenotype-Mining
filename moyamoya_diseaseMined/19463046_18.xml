<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To address a lack of data on clinical characteristics and long-term outcomes in the treatment of MMD in North America, the authors analyzed their experience at Stanford University Medical Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They report on a consecutive series of patients treated for MMD and detail their demographics, clinical characteristics, and long-term surgical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data obtained in consecutive series of 329 patients with MMD treated microsurgically by the senior author (G.K.S.) between 1991 and 2008 were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic, clinical, and surgical data were prospectively gathered and neurological outcomes assessed in postoperative follow-up using the modified Rankin Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Association of demographic, clinical, and surgical data with postoperative outcome was assessed by chi-square, uni- and multivariate logistic regression, and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The authors treated a total of 233 adult patients undergoing 389 procedures (mean age 39.5 years) and 96 pediatric patients undergoing 168 procedures (mean age 10.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Direct revascularization technique was used in 95.1% of adults and 76.2% of pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 264 patients undergoing 450 procedures (mean follow-up 4.9 years), the surgical morbidity rate was 3.5% and the mortality rate was 0.7% per treated hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cumulative 5-year risk of perioperative or subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 5.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 171 patients presenting with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, 91.8% were free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> at 1 year or later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, there was a significant improvement in quality of life in the cohort as measured using the modified Rankin Scale (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Revascularization surgery in patients with MMD carries a low risk, is effective at preventing future ischemic events, and improves quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients in whom symptomatic MMD is diagnosed should be offered revascularization surgery </plain></SENT>
