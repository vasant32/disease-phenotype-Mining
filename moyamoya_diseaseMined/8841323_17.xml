<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiology is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the superficial temporal arteries from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, particularly children, to determine whether the extracranial arteries as well as the intracranial arteries are involved in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Small branches of the superficial temporal arteries were obtained from 22 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> during indirect arterial bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histological examinations were performed, and the findings were compared with those of arteries from 12 control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intimal thickening was observed in 9 of 17 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> younger than 20 years but in none of 7 control patients under the age of 20 years (P &lt; .02, Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intimal thickening appeared from age 20 years in control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The arteries of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients showed fibrocellular intimal thickening with a paucity of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The arteries from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients contained strongly stained multilayered elastic fibers in the thickened intima, while those from control patients showed only weakly stained elastic fibers in the intima </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> is a systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results indicate systemic etiologic factors that may promote the early development of intimal thickening in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
