<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although the development of a noninvasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> examination has increased the opportunity to identify asymptomatic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> who have experienced no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> episodes, their clinical features are still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was the first multicenter, nation-wide survey focused on asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in Japan and was designed to clarify their clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A clinical database of asymptomatic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> was collected from 12 participating hospitals in Japan between 2003 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In total, 40 patients were enrolled in this historical prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, 6 underwent surgical revascularization, including superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery anastomosis and/or pial synangiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their demographic and radiological findings as well as outcome were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On initial evaluation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and disturbed cerebral hemodynamics were detected in approximately 20% and 40% of the involved hemispheres, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Angiographical stage was more advanced in more elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 34 nonsurgically treated patients, 7 experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (n=3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (n=1), or <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> (n=3) during follow-up periods (mean, 43.7 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The annual risk for any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 3.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Disease progression was associated with ischemic events or silent infarction in 4 of 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No cerebrovascular event occurred in the 6 patients who underwent surgical revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings revealed that asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> is not a silent disorder and may potentially cause ischemic or hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> should be carefully followed-up to further clarify their outcome and to establish the management guideline for them </plain></SENT>
