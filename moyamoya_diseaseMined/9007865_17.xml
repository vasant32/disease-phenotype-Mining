<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To revascularize ischemic territories of both the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), a simple and effective combined bypass operation was performed in 36 pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> during the past 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The branches of the superficial temporal artery (STA) were used to revascularize the ACA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In children older than 5 years, the parietal branch of the STA was usually used for an end to side anastomosis with a cortical branch of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In children who were younger than 5 years, the parietal branch of the STA was used for an encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis instead of a direct anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis, using the proximal part of the intact frontal branch of the STA, and encephalomyosynangiosis, using the temporal muscle, were also performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients to stimulate spontaneous anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, bilateral frontal burr holes were made in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients to induce vascularization of the ACA territories from the distal part of the intact frontal branch of the STA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first operation was performed on the dominant side, then a similar procedure was performed on the opposite side after an interval of at least 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postoperative clinical symptoms and the findings from magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, angiography, and electroencephalography demonstrated improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the placement of bilateral burr holes (while leaving the frontal branch of the STA intact), in addition to the STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis, encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis, and encephalomyosynangiosis, is very effective in vascularizing the ischemic ACA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territories in pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
