<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to clarify the cerebrovascular response in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e>, the autoregulation and <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> response was investigated using the 81mKr continuous cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurement technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 32 measurements were made over the anterior and posterior circulation in 16 Moyamoya patients (seven adults, nine children) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CBF measurements were made during four loading trials (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> inhalation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Study was then made of the vascular response of the frontal lobe, perfused by the internal carotid artery (ICA), and the occipital lobe and cerebellum, perfused by the vertebral artery (VA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Deficits of autoregulation were more severe among the juvenile cases in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> than to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in both the ICA and VA regions, but the deficits were mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> response to hypercapnea in the juvenile cases tended to be abnormal in both the ICA and VA regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both adult and juvenile patients showed deficits in the ICA region in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo>, some of whom exhibited paradoxial responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Notable differences in the severity of the deficits of the vascular response in adult and juvenile cases were seen, with the deficits in the response being more severe among the juvenile cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, significant regional differences in the deficits were also found </plain></SENT>
