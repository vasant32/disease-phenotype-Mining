<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography showed stenoses of the main trunks of the intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He was admitted to our hospital, and angiography revealed occlusion of the left cervical internal carotid and right middle cerebral arteries, and stenoses of the right internal carotid, right anterior cerebral, left vertebral, and right posterior cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was collateral circulation formed from the left external carotid and left posterior cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>123I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> SPECT showed low perfusion of the right cerebral hemisphere, and response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> was poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on the angiographical findings and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, the patient was diagnosed as having quasi-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since there was no recipient artery adequate for STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis, encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis was performed on the right side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, the patient's recent memory improved gradually, and angiography performed 7 months after the operation revealed neovascularization from the superficial and deep temporal arteries </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neovascularization with indirect bypass surgery can be expected if the patient is under misery perfusion, even in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
