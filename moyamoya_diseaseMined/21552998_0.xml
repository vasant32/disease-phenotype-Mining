<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Thirty-four pediatric age patients with unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) were reviewed to analyze the natural history and the predictive factors for progression to bilateral MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty out of 259 MMD patients cared for between January 2000 and June 2008 in the Severance Hospital had unilateral lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients were followed for a mean of 32.3 months for their symptoms and imaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four out of 40 patients were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and magnetic resonance perfusion (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> perfusion) images were taken for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients for initial diagnosis and repeated at 6 months from the initial diagnosis and then at yearly basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations, the results of imaging studies, outcome of the indirect revascularization procedure, and the progression of the lesion were reviewed in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of these 34 patients, contralateral progression was identified in 20 patients (58.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourteen (70%) out of the 20 patients presented with anterior cerebral artery abnormalities at diagnosis progressed to bilateral disease as well as did 5 (83%) out of 6 patients with middle cerebral artery lesions at the initial examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the 34 patients, six exhibited familial history of MMD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them progressed to bilateral disease (100%, p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Careful and long-term follow-up would be essential to evaluate the hemodynamic status and progression to bilateral disease in unilateral MMD patients to make prompt decision for a surgical revascularization </plain></SENT>
