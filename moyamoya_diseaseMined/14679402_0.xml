<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Theories of inflammatory and immunologic mechanisms have been proposed as the pathogeneses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have designed a new method of administering N-acetylmuramyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32433">L-alanyl</z:chebi>-D-isoglutamine (MDP) for experimental induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> using an intravascular interventional technique combined with rod-shaped embolic materials made from <z:chebi fb="22" ids="28358">lactic acid</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17497">glycolic acid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53310">copolymer</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The embolic materials containing MDP were repeatedly injected into the right internal carotid artery of monkeys in the embolic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intravenous injections of MDP solution alone were performed in the intravenous group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological examination of the arteries demonstrated reduplication and lamination of the internal elastic laminae, which corresponded with findings of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These histological changes occurred not only in the intracranial arteries on the embolization side, but also in the contralateral intracranial and even extracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The changes were more prominent in the intravenous group than in the embolic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the systemic humoral factors induced by MDP in this study may be important in the pathogeneses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our observations suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> is a systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> and has an etiologic factor affecting both intracranial and extracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
