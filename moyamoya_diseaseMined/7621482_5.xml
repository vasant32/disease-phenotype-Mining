<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its mechanism, however, remains obscure </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow and its reactivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> were analyzed using the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-133 inhalation method and single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography in six children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results were compared with the EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regional vasoreactivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> was significantly lower in "re-build-up" -positive regions than in "re-build-up" -negative regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperative studies revealed a significant improvement of reactivity in the regions where the "re-build-up" phenomenon disappeared after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the "re-build-up" phenomenon represents a focal reduction of the cerebral perfusion reserve in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
