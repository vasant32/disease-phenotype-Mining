<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The hemodynamics of the anterior cerebral arteries (ACAs) were studied in 28 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 39% of 56 cerebral hemispheres, antegrade filling of the ACAs was not verified by preoperative angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, adequate collateral pathways to the ACA territory were generally not achieved by encephalomyosynangiosis (EMS) or superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors have devised new surgical methods for the revascularization of the ACA territory, which they term "encephaloarteriosynangiosis" (EAS) and "encephalogaleosynangiosis" (EGS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these procedures, one or several burr holes are made in the frontal skull, the dura mater is incised, and either the frontal branch of the STA or the pedicled galea aponeurotica stump is placed on the surface of the frontal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to EMS or STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis, these methods were applied to 23 cerebral hemispheres in 14 pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 14 cerebral hemispheres (61%) of 10 patients, postoperative external carotid angiograms showed some cortical branches in the ACA territory, and clinical improvement was achieved in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> affecting the lower extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of this study demonstrate that EAS and EGS are simple and useful techniques for revascularization of the ACA territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, EGS can be applied to the territory of the posterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
