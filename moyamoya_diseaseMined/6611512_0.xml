<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fifty two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, which was diagnosed with CT scan, were reviewed in relation to the prognostic significance of the intraventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following items were analyzed in each patient in order to classify the severity of the patients; cause of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, level of the consciousness at the time of evaluation, volume of the intraventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, midline shift, cast formation of the intraventricular clots in the third and/or fourth ventricle and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The total mortality rate of the patients analysed was 32.7%, whereas 42.3% of the patients returned to useful life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Level of the consciousness and cause of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> were found most contributory factors to the prognosis, and, in general, the patients whose consciousness were better than in semicomatose state, could expect reasonably fair prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the level of consciousness was worse than semicoma, they were divided in two groups according to the cause of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases with ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> or hypertensive <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> showed as a rule poor prognosis and, on the contrary, patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">MoyaMoya disease</z:e> were not always poor in outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the former group the level of consciousness was quite low and the prognosis was poor with higher mortality, if the intraventricular clot occupied over two third of the ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, cases with intraventricular clot caused by <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> stayed in good level of consciousness even the intraventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> extended into the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ventricles, and the prognosis was not pessimistic unless the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> was unoperable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The midline shift on CT scan was well correlated with the high mortality in the cases of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
