<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conservative, endovascular, and surgical treatments have been described primarily through case reports and reports of individual authors' experiences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to report neurological outcomes in a single-institution experience of ruptured lenticulostriate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors have conducted a retrospective review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases involving patients with ruptured <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> who presented to the Mt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sinai Hospital neurosurgical service between September 2001 and January 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over 5.4 years, the authors treated 6 patients with 7 LSA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>-6 ruptured and 1 unruptured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Hunt and Hess grade on admission ranged from I to IV, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in 5 of the 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Catheter angiography confirmed the presence of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients underwent a pterional craniotomy and clipping or resection of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, performed by a single surgeon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Associated risk factors in our series of patients included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009171" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cocaine abuse</z:e>, and intracranial occlusive disease suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean size of the 6 ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> was 3.2 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e> was preserved in 3 of 6 patients, but <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e> preservation did not correlate with development of a postoperative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, clinically or radiologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patients with ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, the mean modified Rankin Scale score at discharge was 1.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The 3 patients in whom the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e> was sacrificed had good outcomes, suggesting that loss of the artery is clinically well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This case series demonstrates that surgical treatment of ruptured <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> can be an appropriate, effective, and safe therapy </plain></SENT>
