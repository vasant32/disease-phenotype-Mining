<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There have been few investigations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in the United States and no systematic description of the management practices or outcome from this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors reviewed their experience with this disease to gain a better understanding and improve the treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over a 25-year period 30 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> have been treated at the University of Iowa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cases were divided into patients who had classic, probable, and akin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results indicated that there was a bimodal age distribution and a female predominance of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In estimating the referral pattern of our institution, the authors determined that there were greater numbers of epidemiological characteristics than previously anticipated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated either surgically or nonsurgically, and different management strategies were utilized in each of the major groups: superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery anastomosis and encephalodurosynangiosis in the surgical group; or antiplatelet, anticoagulation, or nonpharmacological intervention in the nonsurgical group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that there is a higher prevalence and incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in the United States than previously reported and that there are some clinical characteristics of this disease that differ from the cases reported in southeast Asia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These differences may be due to genetic or environmental factors but can also be partly explained by the lower index of suspicion for this disease and, thus, a delay in or complete absence of the correct diagnosis </plain></SENT>
