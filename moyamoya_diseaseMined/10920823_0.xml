<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we discussed the usefulness of DWI obtained using 0.5T MRI in comparison with CT, MRI (FLAIR and T2 weighted image) and SPECT (99mTc-HMPAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DWI were able to detect ischemic lesions earlier than FLAIR or T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Scanning time was short at four seconds for eight slices, and the quality of image was sufficient for clinical usage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most available b-value seems to be 800 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were less susceptibility artifacts in the 0.5T DWI than in the 1.5T DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From these data, we presume that it is possible to detect super-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> on the 0.5T DWI, proving the clinical usefulness of DWI </plain></SENT>
