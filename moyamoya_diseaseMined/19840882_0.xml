<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There are a few reports of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) in the European Caucasian adult population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present the clinical manifestations, the neuroradiological aspects, the treatment, and the outcome after surgical revascularization of four French patients with MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified four adults (age &gt;18 years; three women and one man) with MMD who underwent digital subtraction catheter angiography at our institution from 1997 through 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age at symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 35 years (range, 22 to 41 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The initial clinical presentation was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> in three patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three patients underwent bilateral surgical revascularization and one patient underwent unilateral surgical revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent the same surgical revascularization procedure (encephalo-duro-arterio-myo-synangiosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean (+/-SD) period of follow-up after diagnosis of MMD was 6 years and 9 months (+/-3 years and 5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No patient experienced any recurrent hemorrhagic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patient was severely disabled or unable to walk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three patients out of four were employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest safety and a potential benefit of surgical revascularization (indirect bypass surgery) in European adult patients with symptomatic MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further long-term prospective multicenter studies are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The establishment of a registry would be useful in order to accumulate data in large numbers of European patients with this uncommon disease </plain></SENT>
