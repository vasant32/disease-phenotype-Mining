<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The natural history of unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) in adult patients is not clearly described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a series of 18 patients with unilateral MMD and analyze the risk factors for progression to bilateral disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of 157 MMD patients treated at Stanford University Medical Center from 1991 to 2005 identified 28 patients with unilateral MMD (defined as none, equivocal or mild involvement on the contralateral side) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen patients (5 males and 13 females) were identified with unilateral MMD and angiographic follow-up of &gt; or =5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean radiologic follow-up (+/- standard error of the mean) was 19.3 +/- 3.4 months and mean clinical follow-up was 24.5 +/- 3.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011463'>childhood onset</z:hpo> MMD and 13 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiographic progression from unilateral to bilateral disease was seen in 7 patients (38.9%) at a mean follow-up of 12.7 +/- 2.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four of the 7 patients had significant clinical and radiologic progression requiring surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five of 7 patients that progressed had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo> MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of equivocal or mild stenotic changes of the contralateral anterior cerebral artery (ACA), middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) or internal carotid artery (ICA) was an important predictor of progression (p &lt; 0.01); 6 of 8 patients (75%) with equivocal or mild contralateral disease progressed, whereas only 1 of 10 patients (10.0%) with no initial contralateral disease progressed to bilateral MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient had mild or equivocal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, ICA and ACA stenosis at the time of initial diagnosis and this patient progressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Contralateral progression in the adult form occurs more commonly than previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The presence of minor changes in the contralateral ACA, intracranial ICA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> is an important predictor of increased risk of progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with a completely <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> angiogram on the contralateral side have a very low risk of progression </plain></SENT>
