<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> is one of the major clinical presentations in pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical features and underlying mechanisms are not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to clarify the clinical feature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> and the effect of surgical revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included 29 pediatric patients who underwent superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis and indirect bypass for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their medical records were precisely evaluated to identify the clinical features of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The findings on magnetic resonance imaging, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography, and single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography also were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was documented in 11 (38%) of 29 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of them complained of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in the frontal or temporal region in the morning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> was significantly related to more advanced disease stage and to the decreases in cerebral blood flow and its reactivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surgical revascularization completely resolved <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings strongly suggest that disturbed cerebral hemodynamics may play key roles in developing severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis and encephalo-duro-myo-arterio-pericranial synangiosis may be effective procedures to rapidly resolve <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> by widely supplying collateral blood flow to the operated hemispheres </plain></SENT>
