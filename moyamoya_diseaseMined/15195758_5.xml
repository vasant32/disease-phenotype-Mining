<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the hemodynamic and metabolic status in relation to the development of basal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels (BMVs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and cerebral blood volume (CBV) were measured using PET in ten patients with ischemic adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (mean age, 36.6 years) and six age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (mean age, 33.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cerebrovascular reserve (CVR) after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> (ACZ) loading was also estimated using <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-123 N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="43448">iodo</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi> single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (123I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Based on the angiographic findings, eleven cerebral hemispheres with well-developed BMV (extensive BMV hemispheres) and nine cerebral hemispheres with diminished BMV (diminished BMV hemispheres) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main routes of collateral circulation in extensive BMV hemispheres were BMVs and leptomeningeal anastomoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in diminished BMV hemispheres, transdural anastomosis was predominant, and leptomeningeal anastomoses were less developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In cortices distal to the occluded internal carotid artery, the extensive BMV hemispheres exhibited a significantly lower CBF, CMRO2, CBF/CBV, and CVR (p &lt; 0.05) and a significantly higher CBV and OEF than in diminished BMV hemispheres and controls (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Except for the CBF in the white matter, the mean hemodynamic and metabolic parameters of the diminished BMV hemispheres were not significantly different from those of the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The extensive development of basal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels is a sign of severe hemodynamic impairment in adult patients with ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results may not apply to adults with hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
