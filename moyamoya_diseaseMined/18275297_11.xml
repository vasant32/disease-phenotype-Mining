<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A literature review was performed to review the origins and current uses of the STA bypass procedure in neurosurgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The idea of providing additional blood supply to the brain to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and maintain neurological function has been present in the mind of neurosurgeons for many decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 1967 the first STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass was done by M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>G </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ya≈üargil, and an enormous step was made into the field of microneurosurgery and cerebral revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the decades that followed, this technique was used as an adjuvant or a definitive surgical treatment for occlusive disease of the extracranial and intracranial cerebral vessels, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376527" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">skull base tumors</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, carotid-cavernous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With the results of the first randomized extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass trial and the development of endovascular techniques such as angioplasty for intracranial atherosclerotic disease and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, the indications for STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass became limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurosurgeons continued to perform EC-IC bypasses as an adjuvant to clipping of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376527" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">skull base tumors</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>; the procedure is less commonly used for atherosclerotic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (CAO) with definite evidence of hemodynamic insufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The evidence that patients with symptomatic CAO and "misery perfusion" have an increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk has prompted a second trial for evaluating EC-IC bypass for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Carotid Occlusion Surgery Study is a new trial designed to determine whether STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass can reduce the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>New trials will also reveal the role of the STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass in the prevention of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The role of STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass in the management of cerebrovascular disease continues to be refined and evaluated using advanced imaging techniques and by performing randomized trials for specific purposes, including symptomatic CAO </plain></SENT>
