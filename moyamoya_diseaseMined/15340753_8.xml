<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to find out the responsible genes that are located in the 17q25 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Considering the function, we selected nine genes as candidates from a total of 65 genes identified in the 9-cM region of D17S785-D17S836 in chromosome 17q25, and performed sequence analysis on the DNA samples obtained from a pedigree of familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, which showed a complete linkage to the region by a haplotype analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also, we attempted to identify candidate genes that have not been known but might be functionally relevant to the disease among a total of 2,100 expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences using bioinformatics techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The sequence analysis could detect no mutation in the nine genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nor could we identify a novel candidate gene by the EST analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further studies using alternative approaches are warranted to clarify the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
