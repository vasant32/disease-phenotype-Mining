<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of familial occurrence accounts for 9% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The characteristic lesions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> are occasionally seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> type 1, of which the causative gene (NF1) has been assigned to chromosome 17q11.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To determine whether a gene related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> is located on chromosome 17, we conducted microsatellite linkage analyses on 24 families containing 56 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Leukocyte DNA extracted from the family members was subjected to polymerase chain reaction for a total of 22 microsatellite markers on chromosome 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The amplified polymerase chain reaction fragments were analyzed with GeneScan on an automated sequencer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two-point linkage analysis gave a maximum log(10) odds (LOD) score of 3.11 at the recombination fraction of 0.00 for the marker at locus D17S939 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The affected pedigree member method also showed a significantly low P value (&lt;1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>0x10(-5)) for the 5 adjacent markers at 17q25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multipoint linkage analysis also indicated that the disease gene is contained within the 9-cM region of D17S785 to D17S836, with a maximum LOD score of 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>58 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A gene for familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> is located on chromosome 17q25 </plain></SENT>
