<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors review their experience in patients with unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> to identify factors predictive of contralateral clinical and imaging-documented disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors reviewed the clinical and imaging records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> and unilateral disease who underwent cerebral revascularization surgery between January 1985 and June 2006 by using a standardized surgical procedure, pial synangiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 235 surgically treated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e>, 33 (14%) presented with unilateral disease (4 adults and 29 children) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 16 female and 17 male patients, with an average age of 10.4 years (26.8 years for adults and 8.1 years for children; range 1.5-39 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients presented with left-sided disease and 13 with right-sided disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average follow-up after surgery was 5.3 years (3.1 years for adults and 5.6 years for children; range 1-16 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During this period, 10 (30%) of 33 patients progressed to bilateral disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean time until disease progression was 2.2 years (range 0.5-8.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with progression in this series included contralateral abnormalities on initial angiography, previous history of congenital cardiac anomaly, cranial irradiation, Asian ancestry, and familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Young age at diagnosis was associated with a more rapid rate of progression (age &lt; 7 years, 0.9 years to progression and age &gt;or= 7 years, 3.1 years to progression) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Of patients with unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e>, 30% will have progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> during long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this series, the average time of progression from unilateral to bilateral angiographic disease was 2.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Several factors, including contralateral abnormalities on initial imaging, congenital cardiac anomaly, previous cranial irradiation, Asian ancestry, and familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e>, were associated with an increased risk of progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with known unilateral angiographic disease should undergo continued monitoring by using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography at regular intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Treatment with pial synangiosis is safe and confers durable protection against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with both bilateral and unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
