<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Here we describe the clinical features and outcomes of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> who were surgically treated at a single institution in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our cohort included 802 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained by retrospective chart review; follow-up information and outcome were obtained through clinical visits, telephone, or letter interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used the Kaplan-Meier methods to estimate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk by treatment status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms was 28 (range, 0.5-77) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two definite peaks in age distribution were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ratio of women to men was 1:1 (398/404) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Familial occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> was 5.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The initial symptom was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, or others in 564, 113, and 125 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine of the 802 patients (3.6%) received conservative management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The remaining 773 patients (96.4%) underwent neurosurgical revascularization procedures, and 502 of these were bilateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up after surgery (n=773) or conservative management (n=26) was 26.3 months (range, 6.0-101.9 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most subsequent ischemic events appeared in the first 2 years after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier estimated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk was 10.1% in the first 2 years, and the 5-year-Kaplan-Meier risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 12.7% after surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients treated with surgical revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study on the clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in mainland China indicated bimodal incidence distribution with women-to-men ratios of 1:1 and lower rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> in adults compared with in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients had low rates of postoperative ischemic or hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, and the majority of patients had preserved functional status after revascularization </plain></SENT>
