<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, despite its progressive nature of the occlusive lesions in pediatric patients, the prevalence of the progression in adult patients is undetermined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the optimal timing of the revascularization surgery for progressive cases is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address these issues, we retrospectively investigate four cases with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> manifesting as progression before revascularization surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From March 2004 to May 2007, 49 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> aged from 19 to 62 years old (mean 40.5) underwent superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis on 63 hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were strictly followed up by magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging/angiography postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven hemispheres of 15 adult patients without surgery were also followed up at outpatient service during the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If the patients manifest as the progression of the steno-occlusive lesion on the hemisphere without surgery, they undergo revascularization surgery after the confirmation of hemodynamic compromise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During this period, 47 hemispheres including those of outpatient cases were conservatively followed up after initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among them, six hemispheres (12.8%) of four patients had been proven to show apparent progression of steno-occlusive lesion and were subjected to revascularization surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative courses were uneventful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four cases, and no patient suffered cerebrovascular event on the operated hemisphere after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>Adult-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, either bilateral or unilateral, has a substantial risk for progression, and careful follow-up is necessary for asymptomatic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Once the patient manifests as the progression of cerebrovascular occlusive lesions or ischemic symptoms, we recommend revascularization surgery after the confirmation of the hemodynamic compromise </plain></SENT>
