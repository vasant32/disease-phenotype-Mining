<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When they showed major symptoms, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were more than 16 years-old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most common presenting symptom was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (ICrH), found in 12 patients or 46% of the total; the second was infarction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, each found in seven or 27% of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only one patient was found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, which were associated with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Suzuki angiographic stage 3 and less than stage 3 accounted for 73% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 52 hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 15 patients underwent single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the derangement of cerebral perfusion was estimated with four SPECT grades (SG), 70% of their hemispheres revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (SG1) or localized decreased-perfusion (SG2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other 30% had extensive decreased-perfusion or localized perfusion defects (SG3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no case who had extensive perfusion defects (SG4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 17 patients underwent EDAS operations (EDAS group) and nine did not undergo any operation (no-op group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The EDAS group had significantly better clinical outcomes than the no-op group after a 12-month median follow-up period (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The angiographic and SPECT follow-up studies comprised six and seven cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was also satisfactory angiographic revascularization in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> follow-up cases and improvement in cerebral perfusion at SPECT follow-up in six of seven cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the involvement of posterior circulation of MMD is not frequent and cerebral perfusion is preserved in adulthood-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> MMD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings may explain the reason why <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> are frequent and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> of symptoms in adulthood-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> MMD </plain></SENT>
