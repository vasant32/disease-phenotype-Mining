<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 11 patients under 15 years old were enrolled, whose main symptoms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In nine patients, the more and less affected hemispheres could be determined according to their symptoms and/or single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A single voxel point resolved spectroscopy was performed in the frontal or parietal white matter bilaterally by using 1.5 Tesla <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> system (repetition time 2000 ms and echo time 272 ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Voxels were located within areas that were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on T1- and T2-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pre-operative Cho, Cre and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> values were within respective <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No metabolite showed a significant difference between the more and less affected hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of six patients were examined before and after revascularization surgery on one side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pre- and post-operative comparisons demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three metabolites showed statistically significant increases following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that, although the mechanism of spectroscopic changes needs to be further investigated, proton MRS provides a valuable method to evaluate cerebral metabolism in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
