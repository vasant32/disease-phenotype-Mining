<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To clarify the incidence and pathogenesis of transient COS after surgical revascularization for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included 21 patients who underwent superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis and indirect bypass because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their medical records were evaluated to identify clinical features of postoperative transient COS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings on MRI, magnetic resonance angiography, and single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography were also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Transient COS developed in 8 (22.9%) of 35 operated hemispheres, or in 6 (28.6%) of 21 patients between 3 and 20 days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most of the COS were associated with mild <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of the ipsilateral face and hand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous radiological studies detected no findings of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> or postoperative hyperperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis was patent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, their disease stage more frequently progressed owing to considerable blood flow via STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis, and basal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels disappeared or diminished in patients with transient COS rather than in those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Transient COS after surgical revascularization for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> is not rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Bypass flow through STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis may stimulate a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> of disease stage and diminish basal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels, causing transient COS within 3 weeks after surgery </plain></SENT>
