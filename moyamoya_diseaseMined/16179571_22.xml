<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The progression of occlusive lesions in the major intracranial arteries was believed to be very rare in adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aims to clarify the incidence and clinical features of disease progression in adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For the past 15 years, 120 adult Japanese patients were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 63 patients were enrolled in this historical prospective cohort study on a total of 86 nonoperated hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were followed up with a mean period of 73.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI and magnetic resonance angiography were repeated every 6 to 12 months, and cerebral angiography was performed when disease progression was suspected on MRI and magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Disease progression occurred in 15 of 86 nonoperated hemispheres (17.4% per hemisphere) or in 15 of 63 patients (23.8% per patient) during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Occlusive arterial lesions progressed in both anterior and posterior circulations, in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, and in both bilateral and unilateral types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight of 15 patients developed ischemic or hemorrhagic events in relation to disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that the odds ratio conferred by a male patient was 0.20 (95% CI, 0.04 to 0.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of disease progression in adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> is much higher than recognized before, and female patients may be at higher risk for it than male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Careful follow-up would be essential to prevent additional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurrence in medically treated adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, even if they are asymptomatic or are diagnosed as having unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
