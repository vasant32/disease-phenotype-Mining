<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its familial occurrence suggests genetic background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that paternally imprinted gene might be associated with this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To identify the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) with monoallelic expressions on chromosome 3, we used mouse A9 hybrid cells having human chromosome 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two ESTs showed only maternal expression in mouse A9 hybrid cells, and four showed non-expression in the lymphocytes derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although these ESTs are clustered on the same 150 kb region, we finally failed to identify cDNA in this region </plain></SENT>
