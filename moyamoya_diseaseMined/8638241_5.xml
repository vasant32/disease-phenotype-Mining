<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgery used in treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> to vascularize the brain include direct and indirect anastomoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Intracranial omental transplantation (OMT) was performed using a branch of the superficial temporal artery (STA) that had been used previously for encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS) in five children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five children continued to have paraparetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo>, and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0006887'>progressive mental retardation</z:hpo> even after EDAS and/or STA-middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis and encephalomyosynangiosis (EMS) to the territory of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Previously performed EDAS gave insufficient collaterals to the territory of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in four of the five patients and sufficient collaterals to the territory of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in the remaining patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OMT was performed after stripping of a branch of the STA used in EDAS that gave insufficient collaterals to the brain in the former four patients; and the latter patient was performed using a parietal branch of the STA distal to the distal burr hole drilled in the previous EDAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: OMT resulted in marked improvement in neurologic conditions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four of the five patients suffered no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> postoperatively, while the remaining patient still had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> but at a markedly decreased frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In summary, OMT using a branch of the STA used in previously performed EDAS is required for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> who continue to manifest <z:hpo ids='HP_0002385'>paraparesis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo>, and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0006887'>progressive mental retardation</z:hpo> even after multiple EDAS </plain></SENT>
