<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no criteria have been established for the management of such cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to clarify the natural history of asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten patients were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of them had experienced any episode due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and were only incidentally diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 4 males and 6 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their ages ranged from 30 to 67 years, with the mean age of 46.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography showed there was the tendency of disease progression in elder patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MRI detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in 3 of 10 patients (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, such as impaired reactivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> and/or elevated oxygen extraction fraction, was observed in 4 of 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only one patient underwent surgical revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Antiplatelet or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsant</z:chebi> medication was administered in 5 of 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 4.1 years, ranging from 0.5 to 13 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During follow-up periods, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> lesion markedly progressed and caused <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, neither ischemic nor hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred in the other 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Multi-center nation-wide study should be planned to clarify the natural course of asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and establish the management guidelines for patients with asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
