<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment options are either direct or indirect revascularization procedures or a combination thereof </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specialized centers report sufficient revascularization in most patients and low complication rates.Between 2005 and 2008, direct extra-intracranial bypass surgery in combination with encephalomyosynangiosis (EMS) was performed in 71 Moyamoya patients at the Mannheim University Medical Center.Following one case of reversible neurological deficits associated with mouth opening, we prospectively evaluated the effect of mouth opening on bypass function in this patient and four further consecutive patients by digital subtraction angiography.Three out of five patients showed alterations in bypass patency upon mouth opening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The obstruction was located at the junction of the bypass and the temporal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two temporary occlusions and one case of decreased flow were observed </plain></SENT>
