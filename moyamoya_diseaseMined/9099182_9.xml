<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We have previously reported that cerebral blood flow decreased and oxygen extraction fraction and cerebral blood volume increased in pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, whereas these values did not change significantly in adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we measured the cerebrovascular response to <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> using <z:chebi fb="2" ids="36932">15O</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) in each group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These data were also compared with the oxygen extraction fraction and transit time (cerebral blood volume/cerebral blood flow) measured by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="36932">15O</z:chebi> PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects consisted of 20 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (7 pediatric and 13 adult patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was measured by the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="36932">15O</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> bolus injection method at the resting state and during the inhalation of 5% <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2 </z:chebi></plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> response was estimated as the percentage change of cerebral blood flow per 1 mm Hg change of PaCO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Oxygen extraction fraction and transit time were measured by the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="36932">15O</z:chebi> steady-state method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cerebrovascular response to <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> severely decreased over the cerebral cortices in both pediatric and adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> when compared with those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects, and there was no significant difference between pediatric and adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was observed between the <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> response and transit time, whereas no significant correlation was seen between the <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> response and oxygen extraction fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that the cerebral hemodynamic reserve capacity decreased to an equal degree in both pediatric and adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This finding may thus help to explain the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> in adult patients </plain></SENT>
