<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the classical presentation of childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> is <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, cerebral hemodynamic evaluation is important for patient selection for surgery to prevent recurrent ischemic attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Perfusion <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging has been applied to evaluate cerebral hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To correlate the 'basal time-to-peak preservation sign', 'auto-synangiosis sign', and 'posterior involvement sign' on time-to-peak map of perfusion MRI with catheter angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-four children (6.91 Â± 3.08 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> who underwent both perfusion-weighted MRI and catheter angiography were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Given catheter angiography as a reference standard, basal time-to-peak preservation sign, auto-synangiosis sign, and posterior involvement sign were evaluated on time-to-peak maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The basal time-to-peak preservation sign was accurate for the diagnosis of childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e>; both sensitivity and specificity were 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The auto-synangiosis sign showed lower sensitivity (65%), however, with an acceptable specificity (98%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The posterior involvement sign showed lower sensitivity (61%) but had an acceptable specificity (96%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The basal time-to-peak preservation sign may be a universal finding in childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The auto-synangiosis and posterior involvement sign may be useful in determining transdural collateral status and posterior circulation involvement in childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
