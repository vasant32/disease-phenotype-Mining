<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) is a cerebrovascular occlusive disease characterized by progressive stenosis or occlusion at the distal ends of bilateral internal arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In MMD, a decreased number of medial smooth muscle cells in these vessels was previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study focusing on the mechanism of remodeling in intracranial arterial walls of patients with MMD, we first collected tiny pieces of the wall of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) from patients with MMD and then analyzed them by immunohistochemical methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients underwent surgical procedures for the treatment of standard indications of MMD at Kyoto University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specimens of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> were obtained from these MMD patients during the surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> samples were also obtained in the same way from control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The samples were analyzed by immunohistochemical methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> specimens from MMD patients had a thinner media than control specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivities indicating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9160">single-stranded DNA</z:chebi> and cleaved caspase-3 were higher in MMD samples than in control ones and were located in the smooth muscle cells of the media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, as evidenced by activated caspase-3, occurred in the media of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> of MMD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> specimens from MMD patients had thinner vascular walls than specimens from controls </plain></SENT>
