<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to investigate the association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e>-like vessels and cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) in patients with atherosclerotic steno-occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population comprised 34 patients with steno-occlusive lesions in the intracranial cerebral artery caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e>-like vessels at the base of the brain by cerebral angiography, and the presence of CMBs by T2*-weighted MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into 2 groups: those with and those without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e>-like vessels; clinical histories and the incidence of CMBs were compared between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e>-like vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve of 16 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e>-like vessels had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, whereas only 1 patient had a history of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of CMBs did not differ between the 2 groups (31% vs. 28%, p=0.82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The location of CMBs varied and was not associated with the site of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e>-like vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CMBs were not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e>-like vessels in patients with atherosclerotic cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These patients may not have a high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
