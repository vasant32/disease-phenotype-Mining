<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report a patient with congenital constrictive malformations of the internal carotid arteries and a morning glory disc anomaly (MGDA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Descriptive case report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A 14-year-old girl underwent serial ophthalmologic examinations since the age of seven years because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000622'>blurred vision</z:hpo> and floaters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A right optic disk anomaly was present that was most compatible with an MGDA accompanied by an inferior <z:hpo ids='HP_0000611'>choroidal coloboma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because of the association of such disc malformations with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, the patient underwent cerebral MRI and MRA that showed narrowing of both internal carotid arteries, a finding consistent with early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the importance of recognizing the association of MGDA with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, a treatable condition that may have devastating neurological consequences </plain></SENT>
