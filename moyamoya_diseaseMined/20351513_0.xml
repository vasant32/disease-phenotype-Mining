<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We assessed the value of a new magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) technique named hybrid of opposite-contrast (HOP) MRA in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using a dual-echo sequence, we obtained the first echo for time-of-flight (TOF) MRA followed by the second echo for black blood MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We then subtracted the black blood MRA data set from that of the TOF MRA followed by maximum-intensity projection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 14 patients, we performed HOP MRA and compared the findings with those on 3-dimensional TOF MRA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The HOP MRA was also compared with a radionuclide perfusion study (7 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The HOP MRA technique improved the demonstration of distal arteries in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings in HOP MRA correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images in 9 patients as well as with the perfusion study in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The HOP MRA technique demonstrated the distal arterial branches in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> well and facilitated the perfusion assessment with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
