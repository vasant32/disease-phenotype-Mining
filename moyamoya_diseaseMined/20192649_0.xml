<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the etiology of and the reason why MMD is limited to the major intracranial vessels remain unclear, flow dynamics, such as shear stress, may be related to its smooth-muscle cell migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this study was performed to determine the local hemodynamic factor, which concerns the predominance of specific anatomical sites, such as the distal ICA in the early stage and the proximal posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) in the advanced stage of MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors simulated the hemodynamics in the circle of Willis using computational models of 2D geometries of the distal ICA and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A finite-element commercial package, automatic dynamics incremental nonlinear analysis (ADINA), was used to simulate blood flow in these arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Numerical results demonstrated that shear stress was relatively low at the ICA region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distribution of shear stress was related to the predisposing area of MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Diminished shear stress may promote stenosis of the distal ICA, which is a major pathological region in MMD </plain></SENT>
