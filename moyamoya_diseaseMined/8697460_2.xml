<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the case reported on, critical reduction of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was observed during re-build-up phenomenon in the bilateral parieto-occipital area where <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> testing revealed severe impairment of the perfusion reserve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On electroencephalography, the re-build-up phenomenon originated in these areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, re-build-up phenomenon developed into the entire hemisphere 30 s later, even where the severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that rCBF reduction induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> plays a critical role in the appearance of the re-build-up phenomenon, but other factors such as ischemic <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> are also important in the development of this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
