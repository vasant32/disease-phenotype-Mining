<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between asymptomatic microbleeds (MBs) and the occurrence of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Beginning in October 2003, 50 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were enrolled in a prospective study using 3-T magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients were followed from the date of the initial magnetic resonance study until the date of the first subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or final magnetic resonance study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up period was 15 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were comprised of 13 men and 37 women ranging in age from 9 to 68 years (mean age, 40.5 +/- 16.2 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although no MBs were found in 27 patients in the initial magnetic resonance study, a total of 66 MBs were found in the remaining 23 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients had a single MB and 12 had multiple MBs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into three groups according to the number of MBs: a non-MB group, a single-MB group, and a multi-MB group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier curves of the three groups showed a significantly higher likelihood of subsequent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in the multi-MB group than in either the non-MB or single-MB groups (P = 0.0380) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant differences among the three groups were seen in terms of their subsequent infarction-free ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age-adjusted analysis performed with the Cox proportional hazard model also showed the presence of multiple MBs as an independent risk factor (hazard ratio, 2.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.001-13.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of multiple MBs might be a predictor of subsequent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Confirmation of these results will require a study with a larger number of patients and a longer follow-up period </plain></SENT>
