<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the US, it most commonly affects women in their 3rd and 4th decades of life, frequently causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The natural history of this disorder is not well described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is very likely that hemodynamic factors play an important role in the risk of future <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, as has been established in atherosclerotic carotid occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors describe an ongoing, prospective observational study designed to test the hypothesis that increased oxygen extraction in the cerebral hemisphere beyond the occlusive lesion is a predictor of subsequent risk of ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in medically treated patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011834'>moyamoya phenomenon</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On enrollment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergo regional measurements of cerebral oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) with PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Information on baseline clinical, laboratory, epidemiological, and angiographic risk factors are obtained at the time of the PET study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Decisions regarding surgery are made by the treating physicians based on clinical information while being blinded to PET data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients undergo follow-up at 6-month intervals to determine the subsequent risk of ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients will return at 1 and 3 years for repeat PET studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Secondary, exploratory, aims of this longitudinal and blinded study are to determine other predictive factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in this population; to determine preliminary estimates of the effects of different medical treatment regimens in this population; to determine the temporal changes in hemodynamic impairment in medically treated patients; to determine the effects of surgery on hemodynamic impairment in the subset of patients who undergo surgical revascularization; and to obtain estimates of surgical complication rates for patients with and without hemodynamic impairment </plain></SENT>
