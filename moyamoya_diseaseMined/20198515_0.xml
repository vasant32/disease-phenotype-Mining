<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Studies to assess the hemodynamic status of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> are often done to determine the need for surgical revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These studies, including transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography to assess vasomotor reactivity (VMR) to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi>, are generally considered safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE: We describe a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> who experienced a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) following TCD with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SAH has not previously been described as a complication of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> challenge in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While such complications are rare, it is important to consider the possibility of harm related to VMR testing in patients with advanced vasculopathy </plain></SENT>
