<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study examined abnormalities of the recirculation phase of the contrast medium concentration time course curve in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> by using the relative recirculation (rR) parameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aims were to increase understanding of the rR parameter and to assess its possible value in the investigation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six patients with confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and five <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> participants were examined by using dynamic T2*-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> perfusion imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Parametric maps of relative cerebral blood volume, time to peak (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>), and rR were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The width of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> distribution of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> upper limit for rR were derived from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> participants by identification of the 97.5% confidence limits for the distributions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Major vessels were identified by selection of pixels with relative cerebral blood volume &gt;0.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Areas of abnormally prolonged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> and of increased rR were then identified in patients, and the relationship between these parameters and major vessels was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The combination of cerebral blood volume &gt;50%, elevated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>, and elevated rR values accurately identified areas of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessel formation seen on angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Larger well-developed meningeal and basal collaterals did not show abnormalities of rR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Areas of prolonged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> were also observed to occur in the brain distal to <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In three of these, abnormal elevation of rR was observed in the center of regions of prolonged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings support those of our previous work, which suggested that rR can act as an indicator of regional microvascular abnormality, such as that seen in areas of angiogenic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>They also suggest that measurement of rR may provide valuable additional information regarding patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
