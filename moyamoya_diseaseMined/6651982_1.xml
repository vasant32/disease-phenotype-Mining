<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using a new method for rCBF measurement by serial CT scanning with non-radioactive <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> enhancement, CBF was measured before and/or after microsurgical anastomosis in five cases of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods: Studies were carried out on 2 cases of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, 2 of IC occlusion, and 1 of "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e>" disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CBF was measured both before and after surgery in 4 cases, and the remaining case was measured after anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pre-operative CBF was measured 1.4 +/- 0.5 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and post-operative CBF was 2 +/- 1 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While 50 to 70% non-radioactive <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> was inhaled for 25 min and then discontinued, serial CT scanning was carried out every 3 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>K-map (clearance rate), lambda-map (partition coefficient), and CBF-map were displayed on CRT as images of each value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, initial pre-operative CBF decreased not only in the ipsilateral hemisphere, but also in the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Especially in the major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases, CBF reduction in the low density areas seen in CT was more than 75% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After microsurgical anastomosis, CBF increased in both hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In two cases of reversible ischemic attacks without any change in CT, the CBF markedly increased in central areas of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and the CBF values became higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value, that is hyperemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, in the central areas of the major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases, that is, the low density areas in CT, CBF was still very low (under 25% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value) after anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, in these cases, marked hyperemia was seen in the surrounding area of ischemic focus </plain></SENT>
