<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied retrospectively 48 cases of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> aged between 15 and 48 years admitted in the Neurology and Cardiology Departments of the University Hospital of Monastir from 1987 to 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study variables included the full clinical spectrum, spanning historical, laboratory, radiological and outcome parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty four were female and 14 male, the mean age was 33 +/- 8.8 years, with a peak in the 4th decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our series is characterised by the higher incidence of cardioembolic dominated by prosthetic valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>62.5% of patients had common vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Non-atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathies</z:e> were observed in six cases uncommon etiologies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moya-Moya disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu's disease</z:e>...) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Etiology remain undetermined in four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mortality rate was 8.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reccurrences were observed in 12.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>29% of patients have recovered complete autonomy while 26% have conserved severe handicap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found a higher incidence of cardioembolic diseases dominated by prosthetic valve </plain></SENT>
