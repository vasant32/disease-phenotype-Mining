<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-eight patients who underwent MDCTA with use of a 16-detector row scanner and DSA were prospectively included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each study was assessed by 2 independent blinded neuroradiologists; decisions were made in consensus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Findings on CT angiograms, including the original axial data, multiplanar reformations, and volume-rendered images with and without automated bone segmentation, were used to identify the underlying causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-two of the 78 patients (28.2%) exhibited angiographic abnormalities, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the proximal arteries (n = 9), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (n = 7), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> (n = 4), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the distal arteries (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MDCTA detected the underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> in 21 patients except 1 case of small <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of MDCTA for detection of underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> were 95.5%, 100%, 100%, 98.2%, and 98.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MDCTA is a highly accurate imaging technique in the diagnosis of underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> in patients with spontaneous lobar <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
