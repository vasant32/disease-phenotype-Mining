<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Advantages of DSA: (1) relatively noninvasive, (2) can be performed on an outpatient basis, therefore "cost-effective", (3) real time observation possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Disadvantages of DSA: (1) limited spatial resolution, (2) artefacts, (3) small visual field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Main indications of DSA: (1) diagnosis and follow up study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e>, (2) evaluation of patency of by-pass graft, (3) functional assessment (of cardiac output and blood flow etc.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>Aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>, occlusive changes of the carotid or renal arteries are particularly well demonstrated by DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because of three drawbacks mentioned above, DSA is not a good technique for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although it is possible to visualize hypervascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> by DSA, informations obtained by DSA in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> are limited </plain></SENT>
