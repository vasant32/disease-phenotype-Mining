<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> are a relatively frequent diagnostic occurrence in pediatric neuroradiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They occur mostly in three main etiologic contexts: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo>; neonatal distress; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections, focal</z:e> or general inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, but many cases are considered idiopathic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The positive diagnosis is made by CT; in neonates, however, ultrasound appears as a promising tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CT features are basically similar at that age and in adults, although the site of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> may result from pathologies more particular to children (e.g. basal ganglia infarction due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> of the carotid siphon and its branches) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> may be multiple and also more frequently hemorrhagic at that age, the hemorrhagic phenomena affecting only the gray matter except in young infants in which the subcortical white matter may be affected also </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anatomical sequels include focal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and asymmetry of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data regarding the etiology can be gathered from angiography which may show the degree of impairment of the arterial bed, its extent, the collateral blood supply and the morphological type of arterial lesion responsible for the cerebral damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most particular picture at that age is that of the often diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, with its various expressions (segmental narrowing of the lumen, dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, string-of beads appearance) </plain></SENT>
