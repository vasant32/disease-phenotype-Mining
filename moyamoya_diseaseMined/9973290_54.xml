<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> is prevalent among patients &lt;10 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although most cases appear to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo>, approximately 10% occur as familial cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of familial cases has been increasing because noninvasive diagnostic equipment, such as magnetic-resonance imaging and magnetic-resonance angiography, can detect the disease in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected patients, including asymptomatic patients, during screening studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we performed a total genome search to identify the location of a familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> gene in 16 families, assuming an unknown <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A linkage was found between the disease and markers located at 3p24.2-26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A maximum NPL score of 3.46 was obtained with marker D3S3050 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first genetic locus found to be involved in the molecular pathogenesis of familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
