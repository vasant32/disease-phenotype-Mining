<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate cerebral hemodynamics using dynamic Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>-enhanced imaging in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight children (2-11 years of age) with the clinical and angiographic findings typical of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, before and/or after surgical intervention (pial synangiosis), underwent conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging (MRI) and hemodynamic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging (HMRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HMRI used a spoiled gradient-echo with low flip angle (10 deg) and long TE (TR/TE = 24/15 ms) to minimize T 1 effects and emphasize T 2* weighting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Raw and calculated hemodynamic images were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional time-of-flight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography (MRA) and perfusion brain single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) were also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Abnormal hemodynamic maps resulting from <z:mp ids='MP_0005412'>vascular stenosis</z:mp> or occlusion and basal collaterals were observed in six patient studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HMRI depicted perfusion dynamics of affected cerebrovascular territories, detected cortical perfusion deficits, and complemented conventional MRI and MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HMRI findings were consistent with those of catheter angiography and perfusion SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our preliminary experience suggests that HMRI may be of value in the preoperative and postoperative evaluation of surgical interventions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
