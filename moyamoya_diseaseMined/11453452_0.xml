<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report serial diffusion-weighted imaging studies in a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 4-year-old right-handed patient presented with multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the right and left hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each new <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was unambiguously recognized as bright on diffusion-weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Previous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, readily detected on other magnetic resonance imaging sequences, were not bright on diffusion-weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient subsequently underwent bilateral synangiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this case, the diffusion-weighted images were helpful in assessing the extent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, determining the age of the lesion, and correlation with new clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We emphasize the usefulness of diffusion-weighted imaging for following the clinical course of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, in whom new focal deficits are highly suspicious of new <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
