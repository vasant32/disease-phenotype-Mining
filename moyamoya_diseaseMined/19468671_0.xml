<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Yasagil temporary clips have been widely used in extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) arterial bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the extremely delicate vessels involved often require the application of finer clips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report on the use of the Kopitnik <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>) microclip system for superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Kopitnik <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> microclips are new mechanical devices that are used during <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They exert a pre-defined closing force of 50-70 g, and also feature a special, pyramid-shaped structure stamped on inner surfaces of the blades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These characteristics avoid vascular intimal injury and provide a secure grip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We prospectively studied their use in 15 patients requiring STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinical results were excellent and there were no new ischemic events during 6-months' follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Kopitnik <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> microclips have several advantages; they have small and variously sized clip blades (2, 3, 4 and 5 mm), and the small clip head allows the operator an excellent view of the pathology and clip status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Kopitnik <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> microclip appears to be clinically effective and safe for EC-IC bypass surgery, especially when smaller vessels are involved </plain></SENT>
