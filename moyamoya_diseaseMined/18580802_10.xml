<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> is a cerebrovascular disorder characterized by progressive occlusion of vessels comprising the circle of Willis, resulting in formation of collaterals that have a cloudy appearance on angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological research on the cognitive effects of the disorder in adults has been limited in scope and generalizability; only a few case studies have been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The current study was intended to more comprehensively document the nature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> by assessing a large number of adult cases with a neuropsychological assessment test battery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-six adult patients with neurodiagnostically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were given presurgical neuropsychological assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean group performances were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measures assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The highest rate of impairment was for measures of executive functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lowest rates occurred with memory and perception measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive impairment</z:hpo> was present in 11 (31%) of the patients; it was judged to be moderate to severe in four patients (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five patients reported a mild level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and two patients reported a moderate level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present findings suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> diagnosed in adults can impair cognition but that the effect is not as severe as in pediatric cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Executive functioning is most affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Memory and, to a large extent, intellect are spared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The current pattern of results suggests brain region-behavior correlations that deserve further study </plain></SENT>
