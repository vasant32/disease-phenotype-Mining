<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three weeks later, he again suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, and neuroimaging examination revealed fresh <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in the interhemispheric cistern as well as an asymptomatic thalamic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in the contralateral hemisphere, which was not evident at the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction angiography confirmed the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, and single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography demonstrated significant hemodynamic compromise in the right hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He underwent superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis with indirect pial synangiosis without complication one month later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> completely disappeared after surgery, and no further cerebrovascular event occurred during the follow-up period of 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> may manifest with a dynamic course, so careful follow up is necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous manifestation of ischemic attack, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> in a short period in the present case may indicate the underlying mechanism of the cerebrovascular events in this rare entity </plain></SENT>
