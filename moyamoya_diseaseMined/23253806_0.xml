<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the changes of regional cerebral blood flow at the site of anastomosis of superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) to guide the preventive treatment of symptomatic hyperperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 35 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> were recruited from Beijing Tiantan Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 22 males and 13 females with an average age of 29 years (range: 5 - 55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>And there were 10 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regional cortical blood flow (rCBF) was measured by Laser Doppler flowmeter (LDF) before, after and at Day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 postoperation of STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The probe of LDF was implanted adjacent to the area of anastomosis for 144 hours to record the values of rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The baseline LDF values of cortical rCBF near the area of anastomosis were (69 ± 24) PU before anastomosis, (66 ± 74) PU immediately after anastomosis, (123 ± 23) PU at the conscious time after anesthesia postoperation, (297 ± 17) PU at Day 1 postoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>And the LDF values of the following 5 days were (302 ± 31), (317 ± 26), (272 ± 46), (363 ± 54) and (367 ± 24) PU respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: As a safe and effective treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e>, STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis has great risks for symptomatic hyperperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The highest risk time for hyperperfusion is identified after STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
