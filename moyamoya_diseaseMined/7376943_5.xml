<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011834'>moyamoya phenomenon</z:hpo> associated with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in the periphery of a lateral ventricle presenting with intracranial haemorrhage are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In case 1 the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was located in the right basal ganglia, and the patient improved under conservative management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> had increased in size on the second angiogram, and disappeared on the third angiogram obtained nine months after the attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Case 2 the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was located in the peripheral portion of the left posterior cerebral artery, and was surgically excised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pathological examination on surgical material revealed collagenous tissue and laminae only in part of the aneurysmal wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Case 3 the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was located in the peripheral portion of the right anterior choroidal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This patient died, and the autopsy revealed an angiomatous lesion in the choroid plexus of the right lateral ventricle, but the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> itself could not be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> has formed in a portion of a weakened vascular group represented by an abnormally dilated collateral pathway, and that the most likely reason for this would be haemodynamic stress </plain></SENT>
