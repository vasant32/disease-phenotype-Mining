<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RNF213 has been identified as a susceptibility gene for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the association of p.R4810K (G&gt;A) with blood pressure (BP) was investigated in a Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Three independent study populations, the Nyukawa (n = 984), Noshiro (n = 2,443) and Field (n = 881) studies, joined this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BP, body weight and height were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Past and present symptoms and disease and medication histories were assessed by interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Associations of p.R4810K (rs112735431, ss179362673) of RNF213 with BP were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two linkage disequilibrium blocks were constructed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients with p.R4810K (n = 140) and the general population (n = 384) using 39 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning 390 kb around RNF213 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 60 carriers (3 for AA genotype and 57 for GA genotype) were found in these samples, and the minor allele frequencies were 1.4 % in the Nyukawa and Field studies and 0.2 % in the Noshiro study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Regression analyses adjusted for age, sex and body mass index based on an additive model demonstrated significant associations with systolic BP (mmHg/allele): β (standard error) was 8.2 (2.9) in the Nyukawa study (P = 4.7 × 10(-3)), 18.7 (5.4) in the Noshiro study (P = 4.6 × 10(-4)) and 8.9 (2.0) (P = 1.0 × 10(-5)) in the three populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, diastolic BP showed significant associations only in the Noshiro study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Linkage disequilibrium blocks contained none of the BP-associated proxy SNPs reported by previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study suggests that p.R4810K of RNF213 is associated strongly with systolic BP </plain></SENT>
