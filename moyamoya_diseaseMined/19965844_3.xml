<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included plasma samples from 20 MMD patients and nine healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The plasma concentration of five matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-12), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1), resistin, three interleukins (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) and basic fibroblast growth factor was determined using multianalyte profiling systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The concentration of the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2) was measured using ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gelatin zymography for MMP-2 and MMP-9 was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MMD patients exhibited significantly higher plasma concentrations of MMP-9, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1, IL-1beta, VEGF and PDGF-BB, and lower plasma concentrations of MMP-3, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations were found among MMP-9, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1, VEGF, PDGF-BB and TIMP-2 in MMD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There were distinctive expression patterns of matrixins, cytokines and angiogenic factors in MMD patients, which seemed to correlate with disease pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The balance between MMPs and TIMPs was disrupted in MMD and correlated with disease pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and VEGF in MMD patients may play a role in the recruitment of vascular progenitor cells and in the formation of collateral vessels </plain></SENT>
