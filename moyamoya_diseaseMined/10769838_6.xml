<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We reported the case of a 19-year-old female complicated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018213" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Basedow disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She was admitted, complaining of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> function tests showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CT scan revealed left intraventricle <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and angiography revealed the stenoses at the terminal portion of the bilateral internal carotid arteries (ICA) without basal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the angiography, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011782'>thyroid crisis</z:hpo> occurred and we initiated the antithyroid therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bilateral CAG a month after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> revealed that the stenoses had improved partially and the stenosis was thought to be vasospasm caused by the intraventricle <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>But as the collateral circulation had already been established soon after the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, we suspected that the stenoses at the terminal portion of the ICA had existed before the intraventricle <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed one year after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and bilateral CAG revealed that the stenoses at the terminal portion of the ICA had also improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As some investigators have mentioned that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018213" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Basedow disease</z:e> might be associated with the causal genesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e>, we suspected that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018213" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Basedow disease</z:e> might have played an important role in vasospasm after <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and that the stenoses at the terminal portion of the ICA might have existed before the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> took place </plain></SENT>
