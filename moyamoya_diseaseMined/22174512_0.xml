<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) play a major role in diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to describe the spectrum of findings on brain SPECT in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> and to compare the findings with other investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tc99m-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> SPECT scans of seventeen patients (7 children and 10 adults) were analysed to study the brain perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> were detected on DSA in 11 patients, CTA in one, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain perfusion SPECT analysis showed unilateral perfusion defects in 11 patients, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> perfusion in 2 and bilateral defects in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No perfusion defects despite bilateral vascular changes were noted in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were detected on MRI unilaterally in three subjects while multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were identified in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tc99m-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> Brain SPECT showed perfusion defects that were more extensive compared to those detected on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Post <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> studies for assessment of cerebrovascular reserve were done in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two of them showed good cerebrovascular reserve (&gt;1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Follow-up studies post-surgical procedures (Myo-dura synangiosis) done in two patients showed partial resolution of perfusion defects in the involved areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Brain perfusion scintigraphy is an important adjunct in evaluation of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> yielding information about the direct end results of the pathology in the vessels and also prognostic information </plain></SENT>
