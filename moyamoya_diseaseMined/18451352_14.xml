<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Blood oxygen level-dependent MRI (BOLD MRI) of <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp>-induced changes in cerebral blood flow is an emerging technique for mapping cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BOLD MRI signal reflects cerebral blood flow, but also depends on cerebral blood volume, cerebral metabolic rate, arterial oxygenation, and hematocrit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether, in patients with stenoocclusive disease, the BOLD MRI signal response to <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> is directly related to changes in cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with stenoocclusive disease underwent mapping of CVR by both BOLD MRI and arterial spin labeling MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latter technique was used as a reference standard for measurement of cerebral blood flow changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hemispheric CVR measured by BOLD MRI was significantly correlated with that measured by arterial spin labeling MRI for both gray matter (R=0.83, P&lt;0.0001) and white matter (R=0.80, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic accuracy (area under receiver operating characteristic curve) for BOLD MRI discrimination between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal hemispheric CVR was 0.90 (95% CI=0.81 to 0.98; P&lt;0.001) for gray matter and 0.82 (95% CI=0.70 to 0.94; P&lt;0.001) for white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regions of paradoxical CVR on BOLD MRI had a moderate predictive value (14 of 19 hemispheres) for spatially corresponding paradoxical CVR on arterial spin labeling MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete absence of paradoxical CVR on BOLD MRI had a high predictive value (31 of 31 hemispheres) for corresponding nonparadoxical CVR on arterial spin labeling MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Arterial spin labeling MRI confirms that, even in patients with stenoocclusive disease, the BOLD MRI signal response to <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> predominantly reflects changes in cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
