<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although the aetiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) has not been fully clarified, genetic analysis of familial MMD (F-MMD) has considerable potential to disclose it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> pattern and clinical characteristics of F-MMD to enable precise genetic analyses of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 15 highly aggregated Japanese families (52 patients; 38 women and 14 men) with three or more affected members were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The difference in categories of age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (child <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo> and asymptomatic) between paternal and maternal transmission was compared by chi2 statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> families there had been three or more generations without consanguinity, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of transmission, including father-to-son, were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among a total of 135 offspring of affected people, 59 (43.7%) were patients with MMD or obligatory carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Affected mothers were more likely to produce <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> or asymptomatic) female offspring (p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> of F-MMD is <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003829'>incomplete penetrance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, in future genetic studies on F-MMD, parametric linkage analyses using large families with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> are recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>Genomic imprinting</z:mp> may be associated with the disease </plain></SENT>
