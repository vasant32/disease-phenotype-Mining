<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Renal artery lesions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> have been described sporadically in several case reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the angiographic findings of renal artery lesions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and to determine the prevalence of renal artery lesions in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-six consecutive patients with idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were prospectively examined with both cerebral angiography and abdominal aortography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings of abdominal aortography were reviewed for the presence and appearance of renal artery lesions and compared with the clinical data and cerebral angiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 86 patients with idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, 7 patients (8%) were found to have renal artery lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six patients (7%) had stenosis in the renal artery, and 1 patient (1%) had a small saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in the renal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients (2%) with a marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001920'>renal artery stenosis</z:hpo> presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100817'>renovascular hypertension</z:hpo>, which resulted in an <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001920'>renal artery stenosis</z:hpo> in the 2 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100817'>renovascular hypertension</z:hpo> was successfully treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between the presence of renal artery lesions and cerebral angiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Seven (8%) of 86 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> showed renal artery lesions, including 6 stenoses (7%) and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Renal artery lesions are a clinically relevant systemic manifestation in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
