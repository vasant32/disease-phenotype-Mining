<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> are methods of reversing the flow of blood from the external carotid artery system into the cortical branches of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> advances, these operations alone will predictably not correct the deterioration in blood flow in the territory of the anterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was noted in a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> with <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> that a burr hole, made in the frontal region for drainage purposes, induced marked neovascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since then, similar frontal burr holes have been made in five juvenile cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>; this procedure involved making a burr hole in both frontal bones and incising both the dura and the arachnoid membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In two cases a frontal burr hole in both frontal bones and incising both the dura and the arachnoid membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two cases a frontal burr hole was placed simultaneously with EMS, and in the others the frontal burr hole was made following EMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical symptoms improved after the frontal burr hole was made, and dynamic computerized tomography revealed improved circulation in the frontal regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together with conventional surgical therapy for juvenile cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, this operation is considered beneficial both to the circulation in the frontal region and for the protection of frontal brain function </plain></SENT>
