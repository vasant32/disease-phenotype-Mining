<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, measurement of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> antibody titers and analysis of both <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genomic sequences using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed to clarify the correlation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum samples were obtained from 64 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ages ranged from 5 to 66 years, with a mean age of 35.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 23 males and 41 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The serum antibody titers to CMV and EBV were measured by means of compliment fixation test and fluorescent antibody method respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those titers of the patients were compared with those of 13 patients of atherosclerotic internal carotid occlusion and 34 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, CMV and EBV genomic sequence using PCR, which was utilized with specific primer pairs, were performed in 22 patients of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> and ten <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The following results were obtained; The antibody titer of EBV in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> was significantly higher than that in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, no significant difference of antibody titer against CMV was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In EBV DNA analysis by use of PCR, EBV DNA was proved in 15 out of 20 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> and four out of nine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Namely, EBV DNA was seen more frequently in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e>, compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In inverse, CMV DNA was not seen in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> nor <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the antibody titer of EBV revealed high levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> and EBV DNA was also detected more frequently in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results suggested a possibility that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> might be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
