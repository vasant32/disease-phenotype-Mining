<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: An arteriotomy on a branch of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) is required in the procedure of the direct anastomosis for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, and the artery comes to be collapsed after blood is washed out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The phenomenon makes the microsurgical procedure difficult during direct anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A piece of 3-0 blue monofilament <z:chebi fb="80" ids="53550">polypropylene</z:chebi> suture (PROLENE*, ETHICON Inc., a Johnson &amp; Johnson Company, Somerville, New Jersey) was inserted into the lumen of the recipient artery though the ostium after termination of arteriotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diameter of 3-0 PROLENE* was between 0.20 and 0.249 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PROLENE*, a length that was more than the length of the arteriotomy and was less than the distance between the 2 occlusion clamps placed on the recipient artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At this time, the lumen was reopened and the wall of the recipient artery was easily passed by a microneedle with 11-0 monofilament without injury to the posterior wall of the recipient artery by the microneedle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Confirmation as to whether the microneedle snagged and injured the posterior wall of the recipient artery or not was unnecessary with this method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anastomosis was easily performed using this technique for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinical application of the present technique makes the anastomotic procedure easy, even when the diameter of the recipient artery is as small as 0.5 mm </plain></SENT>
