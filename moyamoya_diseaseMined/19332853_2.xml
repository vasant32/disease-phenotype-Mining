<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate whether perfusion magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging can depict hemodynamic status after revascularization surgery and whether changes at perfusion <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging after revascularization surgery correspond with clinical outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: An institutional review board approved this retrospective study; informed consent was waived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pre- and postoperative perfusion <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging data in 67 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (mean age, 7.2 years; range, 2-13 years) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regional time to peak (rTTP) and regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) were calculated by adjusting cerebral time to peak (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) values by using cerebellar reference values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For quantitative regional analysis, pixel values were divided into five categories (&gt;0, &gt;2, &gt;4, &gt;6, and &gt;8 seconds), and percentages of pixels in rTTP meeting these time conditions were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes in the values after revascularization were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperative clinical outcomes were categorized as follows: 1 indicated excellent; 2, good; 3, fair; and 4, poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pre- and postoperative perfusion parameters were compared by using a paired t test; relationships between perfusion parameters and clinical outcomes were investigated by using one-way analysis of variance, with a significance level of .05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: rTTP, rCBV, and percentage of pixels of rTTP decreased significantly after revascularization surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pre- and postoperative rTTP were significantly different for the clinical outcome categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Change in rTTP and change in percentage of pixels of rTTP (&gt;0 seconds to &gt;6 seconds) were significantly different for the clinical outcome categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> and CBV perfusion maps can depict hemodynamic status after revascularization surgery in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, changes in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> perfusion maps after revascularization surgery correspond with clinical outcome in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
