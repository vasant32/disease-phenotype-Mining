<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were female and of ages ranging from 24 to 53 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary diseases</z:e> were hemorrhagic infarction, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and thalamic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Urokinase administration was initiated at 1.3 days average after occurrence of IVH and continued for 3.3 days average in doses of 12,000-96,000 IU per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Average clot lysis times from IVH, as assessed by computed tomography, were 5.0 +/- 0.8, 5.0 +/- 1.4, and 6.0 +/- 0.8 days for the fourth, the third, and the lateral ventricles, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> which was probably caused by urokinase administration through a ventricular catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, this was successfully treated by changing the antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no general <z:hpo ids='HP_0001892'>bleeding tendency</z:hpo> or intraventricular rebleeding due to urokinase administration, and none of the ventricular catheters were obstructed by clots throughout the course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The final outcome was good recovery in two patients, severe disability in one, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242670" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">persistent vegetative state</z:e> in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results correlated well with the consciousness level seen before ventricular drainage in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Consequently, we are convinced that urokinase administration can prevent the harmful effects of IVH and that urokinase is useful not only for lysing ventricular clots but also for maintaining the patency of the ventricular catheter, which is important for control of intracranial pressure in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of severe IVH </plain></SENT>
