<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epidural anesthesia with 10 ml of 2% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> was first used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then general anesthesia was induced with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9536">thiamylal</z:chebi> 200 mg and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45652">succinylcholine</z:chebi> 60 mg just before starting operation and was maintained with 60% nitrous <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> in oxygen </plain></SENT>
