<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both MRI and MRA successfully demonstrated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels in the basal ganglia in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, with a positive but not definite correlation to the conventional angiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRI depicted the stenotic and occlusive lesions of the carotid fork and horizontal portion of the middle cerebral artery effectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRA demonstrated some lesions which even MRI failed to prove, but it tended to overestimate the lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Post-operative state of collateral flow and the patency of EC-IC bypass graft could be evaluated as accurately with MRA as with conventional angiography, although MRA was limited in spatial resolution and evaluation of flow direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, MRI and MRA were considered to be useful in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in stage 3 and 4, but less effective in the evaluation of its angiographical stage </plain></SENT>
