<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To establish multiple bypass flow in an adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> patient, the distal stump of the parietal superficial temporal artery (dsPSTA) was used as an additional donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Its potential as the donor was first evaluated by measuring the arterial pressure directly in three patients, revealing about 80% in mean arterial pressure of those measured at the proximal stump and radial artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The anastomosis was performed just as conventionally except an additional anastomosis between the dsPSTA and frontal branch of the middle cerebral artery in 10 hemispheres of 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patency of the dsPSTA bypass was confirmed on postoperative angiography in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The comparison of pre- and post-operative single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography was feasible in 8 hemispheres of 6 patients of which 7 demonstrated improvement of the cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION; This technique provides a novel source of donor artery in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e>, in which multiple anastomoses are desirable </plain></SENT>
