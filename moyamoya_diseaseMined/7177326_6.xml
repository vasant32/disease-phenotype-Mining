<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 67-year-old male was admitted to our clinic on May 1, 1981, because of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> and a left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>About 6 years ago, when he had a left-sided homonymous hemianopia, carotid angiography revealed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CT scan on the admission showed an intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> in the right temporal lobe, which ruptured to the lateral ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An angiogram demonstrated the net work of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels in the base of the brain and a "newly-appeared" <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> at the peripheral portion of the right anterior choroidal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This artery was shown on the previous angiogram also but did not bear the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the emergent operation the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> was evacuated and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was excised, which was proved histologically to be a false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya diseases</z:e> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> including the present case were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 44 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They were classified into groups--1) the major artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> arising from the major cerebral arterial segments; 2) the peripheral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> arising from the distal segments of the peripheral cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The major artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were found more frequently in the vertebro-basilar system, and the peripheral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in the basal ganglia, near or in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of 26 major artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> 12 were proved to be saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, 9 by surgeries and 3 by autopsy studies respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of 18 cases of the peripheral group the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were excised operatively in two cases, and autopsy studies were performed in other two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The peripheral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were examined histologically in three cases; one was proved to be a false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, the other was thought to be a true <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and the third one was not verified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In 8 cases, the peripheral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> disappeared on the follow-up angiograms and were supposed to be false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>From these reported cases, it may be suggested that major artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are mainly true <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and peripheral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
