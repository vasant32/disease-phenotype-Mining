<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of MMD is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data for 65 consecutive patients with MMD in our institutions and evaluated the histopathological and immunohistochemical findings of intracranial vessels from 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age distribution was found to have 1 peak at 40-49 year-old age group, no significant difference was observed in the female-to-male ratio (F/M = 1.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>Intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> was the predominant disease type (75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Positive family history was observed in 4.6% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histopathological findings were a narrowed lumen due to intimal fibrous thickening without significant inflammatory cell infiltration, and the internal elastic lamina was markedly tortuous and stratified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 autopsy cases showed vacuolar degeneration in the cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study showed the migration of smooth muscle cells in the thickened intima, and aberrant expression of IgG and S100A4 protein in vascular smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Complement C3 immunoreactivity was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This study indicated that aberrant expression of IgG and S100A4 protein in intracranial vascular wall of MMD patients, which suggested that immune-related factors may be involved in the functional and morphological changes of smooth muscle cells, and finally caused the thickened intima </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A possible mechanism is that deposits of IgG in the damaged internal elastic lamina may underlie the disruption of internal elastic lamina, which facilitated S100A4 positive SMCs migrated into intima through broken portions of the internal elastic lamina, resulting in lumen stenosis or occlusion, leading to compensatory small vessels proliferation </plain></SENT>
