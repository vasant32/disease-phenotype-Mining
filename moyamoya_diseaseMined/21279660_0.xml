<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Major artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> may be found incidentally while evaluating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to delineate the prevalence and characteristics of these uncommon <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with a brief mention of their management and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 249 adult patients who were diagnosed with non-hemorrhagic MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiograms obtained at the time of initial diagnosis were carefully reviewed to identify incidental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> located on a major intracranial artery or near its tributaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> originating from distal peripheral arteries or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels were ineligible for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine patients (3.6%) were found to have 13 major artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, 7 (54%) of which were located in the posterior circulation, especially in older patients with bilateral MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sizes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were less than 10Â mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgical clipping was performed on two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and endovascular coiling on six (five posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ischemic complications occurred in two patients after clipping of an anterior communicating artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and in one patient after the second coiling of a recanalized basilar tip <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Incidental major artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> can be found in 3.6% of adult patients with non-hemorrhagic MMD, an observed frequency that increases with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>About half of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are located in the posterior circulation, particularly in older patients with bilateral MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Considering the risks of treatment-related complications, more information about the natural course of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> is needed to design proper management strategies both for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and MMD </plain></SENT>
