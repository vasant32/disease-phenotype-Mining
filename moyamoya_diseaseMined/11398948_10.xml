<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first protocol involved the use of sedation when staff were setting up the intravenous lines, performing neuroimaging studies, and controlling postoperative pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The second involved the use of wound-handling techniques designed to ease postoperative wound care; these included steristrip closure, use of paraffin gauze and not using adhesive tapes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared 14 and 11 surgical cases handled before and after the protocols were introduced, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of patients with perioperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> decreased from 2 to 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Appropriate sedation reduced the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> from 28.6% to 3.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average postoperative hospital stay was similarly reduced, from 21.3 days to 16.1 days, as a consequence of the reduced incidence of complications </plain></SENT>
