<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to clarify the incidence and time course of postoperative hyperperfusion and to determine the independent predictors of postoperative hyperperfusion in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This prospective study included 41 patients who underwent surgical revascularization for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using (15)O-gas <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography, hemodynamic and metabolic parameters were quantified before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography, cerebral blood flow was serially measured just after surgery and on 2 and 7 days postsurgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to test the effect of multiple variables on postoperative hyperperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postoperative hyperperfusion was observed in 29 (50.0%) of 58 operated hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of both radiological and symptomatic hyperperfusion was significantly higher in adult patients than in pediatric ones (P=0.026 and P=0.0037, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hyperperfusion just after surgery more often led to subsequent neurological deficits (P=0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis revealed that preoperative cerebral blood volume increase was an independent predictor of both radiological and symptomatic hyperperfusion after surgery in adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (OR, 6.6 and 12.3, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative hyperperfusion after surgical revascularization is not rare in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Adult patients with a cerebral blood volume increase may be at high risk for radiological and symptomatic hyperperfusion after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Careful perioperative management would reduce surgical complications and improve long-term outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
