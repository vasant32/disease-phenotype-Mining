<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> is a rare, progressive, steno-occlusive disease of the distal branches of the carotid arteries associated with the development of a profuse basal collateral vascular network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the United States, the disease occurs sporadically and literature on the topic in limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With data lacking relative to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> epidemiology and management, we report our survey results among a sample of neurovascular surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 16-question survey was sent as a hyperlink by electronic mail to 46 vascular neurosurgery centers and physicians who have published on this topic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data included patient demographics, referral patterns, treatment, and follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Response rate was 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 32 respondents, 72% evaluated 10 or fewer adults per year, usually referred by a neurologist within their referral pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen (47%) respondents reported that the disease had a bilateral occurrence between 50% and 75% of the time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most respondents (88%) reported that fewer than 25% of their patients had a previous surgery for the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Symptomatology (91%) was the criterion to recommend surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nineteen (59%) respondents regularly assessed cerebrovascular reserve by the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge to their imaging method of choice, typically single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment was antiplatelets (55%) in asymptomatic adults and superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery bypass for &gt;75% of symptomatic patients, as assessed by 48% of respondents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Yearly follow-up included cerebral angiography for both superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery bypass and indirect revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our survey results quantify epidemiologic trends of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Finding a lack of consensus in management strategies, we conclude that collaborative efforts may help to create guidelines for the management of this puzzling entity </plain></SENT>
