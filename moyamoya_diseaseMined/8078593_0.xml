<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, autologous transfusion has been adopted widely as a safer and more effective procedure to prevent these complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors report the experiences of 29 patients who had been operated on after preparation of autologous blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the authors report a study concerning maximum surgical blood order schedule (MSBOS) of these operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>212 patients operated on between January, 1991 and June, 1993 were used for this study of MSBOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although intraoperative transfusion was performed on 14 of 29 patients, the need for homologous transfusion was avoided in 12 of these 14 patients by the use of autologous blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of homologous transfusion was reduced significantly after the introduction of pre-operative autologous blood collection in our clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients' value of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> fell after the collection of blood but these levels were not so seriously low as to impede the performance of operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>212 cases of operated patients were divided according to the operative methods and diagnosis for calculation of MSBOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results were as follows; Craniotomy and removal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> 5u, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> 11u, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100008'>neurinoma</z:hpo> 7u, <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> 5u, transsphenoidal surgery 3u, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> 2u and V-P or S-P shunt 0u </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pre-operative autologous blood collection is easy to achieve for scheduled neurosurgical operations, and autologous transfusion is a beneficial procedure which should be used more widely </plain></SENT>
