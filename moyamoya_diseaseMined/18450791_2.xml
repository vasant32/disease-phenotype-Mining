<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is a frequent manifestation in patients with adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD), but the relationship between the lesion pattern and disease severity has rarely been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were collected on a consecutive series of 65 adult patients with MMD who visited our hospital between 1999 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among them, 32 patients with first ever ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ischaemic lesions were categorised by location and compared as follows: (1) cortical versus subcortical involvement and (2) anterior (fronto-temporal) versus posterior (parieto-occipital) involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lesions were also compared by disease severity, as determined by the extent of intracranial artery involvement (Suzuki's grading method) and by perfusion status visualised on single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Disease severity was significantly greater in patients with cortical involvement than in those with subcortical involvement (Suzuki's grade 4.17 (0.72) vs 2.70 (0.73); p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disease severity was also significantly greater in patients with posterior involvement than in those with anterior involvement (4.50 (0.53) vs 2.83 (0.76); p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In most of the patients (83.3%) the perfusion defect area shown on SPECT was larger than the ischaemic lesion area shown on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with advanced stage adult MMD tended to have ischaemic lesions involving the cortex and posterior part of the brain and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism in these patients was largely associated with haemodynamic compromise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the lesion pattern of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may change along with the extent of arterial involvement </plain></SENT>
