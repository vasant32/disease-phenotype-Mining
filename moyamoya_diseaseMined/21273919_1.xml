<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We evaluated postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> undergoing revascularization surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 2001 to 2007, 43 adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> underwent 53 revascularization surgeries, consisting of direct bypass with or without indirect bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incidence and profile of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were investigated, with evaluation of influencing factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis using a generalized estimation equation was performed to determine which factors were related to postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizures</z:hpo> developed in 10 sides (18.9%) after revascularization for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, including immediate (&lt;24 hours, n = 0), early (1-7 days, n = 5), late (8-30 days, n = 0), and delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (â‰¥1 month, n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early and subsequent delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> developed in the same lesions in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizures</z:hpo> developed only in the patients with combined direct and indirect revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative temporary neurological deficits with imaging abnormalities were significantly related to postoperative nondelayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were significantly different according to the location of the recipient artery (P = .03), especially with the frontal branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By multivariable analysis, revascularization using frontal branches trended toward increased incidence of delayed postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, with adjusted odds ratio of 13.78 (95% confidence interval, 1.7-114.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, the incidence of delayed postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> seems to be higher than that of other pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The delayed, pronounced formation of synangiosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> may be related to the development of such delayed postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, especially when the location of the recipient artery is frontal </plain></SENT>
