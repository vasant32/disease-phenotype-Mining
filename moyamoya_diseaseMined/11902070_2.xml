<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Scanning was usually completed in 20 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Measurements were processed in software to provide a color-coded image of the tissue perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the measurement data, expressed in LD-units, could be used for statistical data analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No physical contact was necessary between the scanning device and the exposed brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The imager provided two-dimensional microvascular flow maps non-invasively and quantitatively during brain operations, and could show the <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity in the vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LD scanning flowmetry is a promising intraoperative monitoring method for cerebral blood flow changes </plain></SENT>
