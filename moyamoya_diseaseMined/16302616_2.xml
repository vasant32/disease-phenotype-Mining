<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> complain of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> before surgery, after surgery, or in both periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify the pathophysiological features of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> which are one of the major symptoms in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> after indirect bypass surgery, the authors reviewed data obtained in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> who underwent such surgery at their institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors surveyed 204 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> younger than 17 years of age who underwent indirect bypass surgery consecutively between 1988 and 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and associated symptoms disturbed their daily activity, required rest and/or medication, and occurred at least once a month, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was regarded as significant and the patient was included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was defined as the presence of significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> 12 months after the operation or later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was documented in 44 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was observed in 63% (28 of 44) of the patients with preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and in 6.3% (10 of 160) of those without preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aggravation on postoperative magnetic resonance images or single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computerized tomography scans did not correlate with this symptom (p = 0.729 and 0.203, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical course had the following features: 1) a coexisting stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>; 2) a second stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> only; and 3) a final stage of improvement or disappearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The authors demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> can persist or develop after indirect bypass surgery despite successful prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition to decreased cerebral blood flow, progressive recruitment and redistribution of blood flow should be considered as a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
