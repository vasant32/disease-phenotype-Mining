<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They showed angiographic findings which were compatible with those of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e>, albeit only on one side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They did not, however, show any basic aetiologic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, the clinical symptoms and the findings of electroencephalography, angiography, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography in these cases were also quite similar to those in the cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> except for unilateral involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 6 patients underwent either direct or indirect EC-IC bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 3 children who received encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis, an indirect bypass procedure, the collateral circulation was well formed postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the follow-up study, 2 of the 6 cases starting with a unilateral lesion developed bilateral involvement later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the other 4 cases persisted in showing only unilateral involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These 4 cases may suggest the existence of "unilateral" <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> in the paediatric age, and it is recommended that such cases be treated similarly to those of bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
