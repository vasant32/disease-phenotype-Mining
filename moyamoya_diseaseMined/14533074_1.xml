<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The morning glory disc anomaly is a not very frequent congenital alteration of the optic papilla associated with a <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vascular dysgenesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several cases of association have been described between this disc anomaly and the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a boy with this association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 5 year-old boy was evaluated for several episodes of disconnection, some of them preceded by intense <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> and associated to incoherent language, and in other occasions with <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> and unmotivated laugh of variable duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The physical and neurological exploration was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, except for the optic disc papilla of the right eye that was very big and dug, compatible with Morning glory disc anomaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No alterations were found at cranial CT and EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the magnetic resonance imaging were visualized multiple small round low intensity areas in the basal ganglia, because of the high number of collateral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The angioRM showed stenosis of the supraclinoid portions of both internal carotids as well as the proximal segments of the anterior cerebral artery and the left middle cerebral artery with abnormal network of collateral vessels at the base of the brain like a puff of smoke  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is a typical imaging for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient with Morning glory disc anomaly, mainly if they presents neurological clinical features, the realization of angioRM studies will be evaluated, to discard the existence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
