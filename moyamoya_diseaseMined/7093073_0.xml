<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cranial computed tomography has been mainly used for detection of the parenchymal space-occupying lesion, and has had the limitation of detection of the cerebrovascular lesion itself because of low CT resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, high resolution CT scanners have recently brought us the possibility of definition of fine cerebral vessels on CT images using an appropriate injection method of contrast agents (cerebral computed angiotomography) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper concerns the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the cerebral vasculature on CT images using 9 fresh cadavers with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intracranial structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They received the postmortem injection of contrast agents through bilateral common carotid and vertebral arteries, and were undertaken the multiplane CT scanning with the axial, modified coronal, Towne (half-axial) and the semisagittal projections using GE-CT/T 8800 (9.6 sec scanning time, 320 x 320 matrices) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of cerebral vessels on the axial plane, obtained at the levels 10 to 90 mm above the canthomeatal line, is presented in this paper </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Main visualized vessels in the posterior fossa were the basilar artery, the cranial loop of the PICA, the AICA from the origin to the hemispheric branches including the meatal loop in the cerebellopontine angle cistern, and the SCA from the ambient and quadrigeminal segments to the lateral marginal and superior hemispheric branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The circle of Willis and other main cerebral arteries were clearly visualized with their small branches, for example, the posterior communicating, the anterior choroidal and the lenticulostriate arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Deep cerebral veins were also visualized at the levels of the midbrain, the middle and the roof of third ventricle, and the body of lateral ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postmortem cerebral computed angiotomography provided us not only the precise <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the cerebral vasculatures, but also their anatomic relations with the surrounding structures such as cerebral parenchyma, ventricles, cisterns and other subarachnoid spaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the clinical point of view, cerebral computed angiotomography can be applied to the screening system of vascular lesions themselves such as asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
