<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate sex differences in preoperative symptoms and treatment outcomes after revascularization surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed 430 MM disease patients undergoing 717 revascularization procedures spanning 19 years (1991-2010) and compared gender differences in preoperative symptoms and long-term outcomes after surgical revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 307 female and 123 male patients (ratio, 2.5:1) with a mean age of 31.0 Â± 16.7 years and adults-to-children ratio of 2.5:1 underwent 717 revascularization procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Female patients were more likely to experience preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (odds ratio: 2.1, P = .001) and less likely to receive a diagnosis of unilateral MM disease (odds ratio: 0.6, P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No association was observed between sex and risk of preoperative ischemic or hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in neurological outcome because both male and female patients experienced significant improvement in the modified Rankin Scale score after surgery (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, 5-year cumulative risk of adverse postoperative events despite successful revascularization was 11.4% in female vs 5.3% in male patients (P = .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, female sex trended toward an association with adverse postoperative events (hazard ratio: 1.9, P = .14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Female patients are more susceptible to the development of preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> and may be at higher risk of adverse postoperative events despite successful revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There is, however, no sex difference in neurological outcome because patients of both sexes experience significant improvement in neurological status with low risk of the development of future ischemic events after surgical revascularization </plain></SENT>
