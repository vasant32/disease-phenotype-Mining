<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Arterial spin labeling technique has come to be applied to magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and perfusion imaging in recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, those non-contrast techniques are mostly limited to single frame images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently we have proposed a non-contrast time-resolved MRA technique termed contrast inherent inflow enhanced multi phase angiography combining spatial resolution echo planar imaging based signal targeting and alternating radiofrequency (CINEMA-STAR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CINEMA-STAR can extract the blood flow in the major intracranial arteries at an interval of 70 ms and thus permits us to observe vascular construction in full by preparing MIP images of axial acquisitions with high spatial resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This preliminary study demonstrates the usefulness of the CINEMA-STAR technique in evaluating the cerebral vasculature </plain></SENT>
