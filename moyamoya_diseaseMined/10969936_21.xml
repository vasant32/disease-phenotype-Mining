<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two patients who had hemorrhagic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> but no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> comprised the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients' clinical charts were examined with respect to their treatment and clinical course after an initial hemorrhagic episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the patients was 43 years and the follow-up period ranged from 0.8 to 15.1 years, with a mean of 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (50%) were conservatively treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 11 patients who were surgically treated, STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass was performed in six patients (27%) and encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS) in the other five patients (23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (41%) presented with an ischemic or rebleeding event during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of future <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> events in patients who had undergone an STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass was significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) than that in patients who had been treated conservatively or with EDAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier plots comparing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free times in patients treated with direct bypass and those in patients who conservatively or with indirect bypass showed a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) in favor of direct bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The effect of STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass on the prevention of recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> or an ischemic event in patients with hemorrhagic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> has been statistically confirmed in this study </plain></SENT>
