<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first case was that of a young girl with three carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> who developed a meningeal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Angiography in the second child, who had had recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegias</z:hpo>, showed multiple stenoses of the cerebral arteries, with a moya-moya appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The third case was a boy with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> and signs of a lesion in the sylvian region on computed brain tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The outcome was favorable in cases 1 and 3, but there were marked sequelae in the second case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Published reports indicate a different frequency for these accidents in the USA (17 to 26 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>cent) and black Africa (less than 5 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>cent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of these accidents is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> may be only coincidental, but they could result from the very widespread arterial lesions observed in sickle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moya-moya disease</z:e> in this case is related to the fibromuscular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> of the cerebral arteries occurring during homozygous sickle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is reported fairly frequently in the published literature and appears to run a more severe course than non-drepanocytic moya-moya cases, with many <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and marked neurological sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Care is required when conducting cerebral arteriography in order to detect these lesions in cases of homozygous sickle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, especially when computed brain tomography is not possible or does not supply confirmation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Exchange transfusion can prepare these patients for arteriography by reducing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobins</z:chebi> levels to 20 p. cent, and it is apparently also a useful adjuvant during therapy of these accidents </plain></SENT>
