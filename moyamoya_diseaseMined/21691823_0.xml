<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We conducted a case-control study to investigate whether polymorphisms in eNOS are related to the age-specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-three Korean patients [mean age, 23.0 ± 16.1 years; 59 female (63.4%) and 34 male (36.6%)] with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were consecutively recruited for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three hundred twenty-eight healthy subjects [mean age, 27.7 ± 16.2 years; 217 female (66.2%), 111 male (33.8%)] were consecutively included in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjects were divided into pediatric (&lt; 20 years) and adult (≥ 20 years) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We further divided the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> group into ischemic and hemorrhagic groups based on clinical and MRI findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequencies and distributions of four eNOS polymorphisms (eNOS -922A&gt;G, -786T&gt;C, 4a4b, and 894G&gt;T) were assessed in pediatric and adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and compared to the frequencies and distribution in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No differences in eNOS polymorphisms were observed between control and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, we found that the 4a4b sequences was less frequent in the adult group (p = 0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared to the control group, there were differences in the haplotype distribution of the study group, specifically the A-4b-G haplotype, which was seen more frequently in the adult patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that pediatric and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> have different genetic backgrounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These genetic differences can affect age-specific clinical characteristics, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
