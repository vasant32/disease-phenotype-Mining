<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five underwent unilateral and seven bilateral anastomosis of the superficial temporal artery to a branch of the middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient aged 22 months underwent bilateral encephaloduroarterisynangiosis (EDAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients deteriorated postoperatively: one died from a probable cardiac cause, one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> and the patient who underwent EDAS suffered further permanent ischaemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No further permanent ischaemic events occurred following STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass (median follow-up 41 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transient ischaemic events persisted postoperatively in four cases, but with reduced severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass may be effective in protecting young patients from further permanent ischaemic events in the treated vascular territory </plain></SENT>
