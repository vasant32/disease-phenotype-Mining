<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to examine the utility and reliability of arterial flow measurements made with a transit time ultrasonic flowmeter for monitoring blood flow changes during intracranial and carotid surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A total of 25 patients underwent intra-operative arterial blood flow measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pulsatile flow curve and mean flow values were obtained using 1- to 6-mm transit time probes with a dual channel flowmeter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four cases underwent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping, 11 cases superficial temporal artery (STA)--middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) bypass, 2 cases external carotid artery (ECA)--radial artery--<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> trapping, and 8 cases carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping, blood flow in the branches distal to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was measured before and after clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood flow in the STA was measured before and after STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis, and blood flow in the internal carotid artery (ICA) cervical portion was measured during carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood flow in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and STA was monitored during radial artery grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Blood flow in the STA was elevated after STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, post-operative hyperperfusion syndrome was found in some cases whose flow elevation was over 50 ml/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also in one case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, of which blood flow of ICA was elevated to 400 ml/min after carotid endarterectomy, hyperperfusion syndrome was found after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the cases of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping, decreasing of M2 flow was detected when clipping caused bifurcation stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: We found transit time flow measurement useful for management of cerebrovascular surgery: the technique was simple to use and provided stable, reliable results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The method was able to reveal distal branch flow diminution in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping, or residual flow during temporary clipping in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery, and has the potential to predict post-operative complications such as hyperperfusion by signalling over-elevation of donor artery flow in bypass surgery or ICA flow in carotid surgery </plain></SENT>
