<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Because of the advance of techniques and age-matched apparatus for blood pressure measurement, and because of the availability of age-related <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values in childhood, the knowledge of the number of children having elevated blood pressures has recently improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a group of healthy children, the first important task is to determine how many incidences of "essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>" there are among them, which may appear in childhood and persist into adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This should urge us to undertake periodical examinations of healthy children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the treatment of "secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>" has similarly been improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since 1979 in particular, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi>, an orally active angiotensin I-converting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23924">enzyme inhibitor</z:chebi>, has successfully been administered to treat children with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and who respond poorly to conventional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We report 3 cases that received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> for refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>: a 2-year-old boy with renal and renovascular anomalies, a 7-year-old boy with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> after surgical operation, and a 17-year-old youth with Cushingoid syndrome due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> administration of steroids against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026272" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MCTD">mixed connective tissue disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the introduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi>, good pressure control was obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 cases, although reasonable effects of measurement values of the renin-angiotensin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> system (decrease in angiotensin I &amp; II, increase in I/II ratio, etc.) were found only in the first case </plain></SENT>
