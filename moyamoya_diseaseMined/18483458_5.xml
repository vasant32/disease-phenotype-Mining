<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical characteristics of the patients with postoperative transient neurological deterioration were analyzed in 120 STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass procedures for ischemic cerebral diseases, such as atherosclerotic disease and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial brain single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed on 25 patients before surgery and on the third and tenth postoperative days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The hemispheric perfusion on SPECT was calculated semi-quantitatively using statistical parametric mapping and a probabilistic brain atlas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 120 procedures, there were 4 permanent postoperative neurological deficits (3.3%) and 20 postoperative transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deteriorations</z:hpo> with unknown etiology (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 25 patients analyzed for postoperative perfusion changes, cerebral perfusion increased on the third postoperative day and the increased perfusion negatively correlated with preoperative perfusion (correlation coefficient = -0.77; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Temporal changes and the location of transient hyperperfusion on SPECT correlated with the time course and neurological deficits associated with postoperative transient neurological deterioration in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative transient relative hyperperfusion is a common phenomenon and may be one of the causes of postoperative transient neurological deterioration after STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass surgery for ischemic cerebral diseases </plain></SENT>
