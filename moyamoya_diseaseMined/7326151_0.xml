<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this paper, the authors report biplane computed cerebral angiotomographic findings in 5 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The specific features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> on the CT image were as follows: On the axial plane, the linear structures of the anterior half of the circle of Willis and the proximal portion of the middle cerebral arteries disappeared, and instead of these <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> structures, irregular, tortuous or patchy high-density areas just like a "caterpillar" were shown in the basal cistern and medial Sylvian fissures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the modified coronal plane, the supraclinoid internal carotid arteries and the carotid fork could be identified only with a difficulty, and abnormal, "nebular" high-density areas consisting of irregular, tortuous or patchy high-density vascular components became visible in the basal cistern extending to the basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A modified coronal plane and intravenous minimum dose bolus injection method seemed to be more useful for the visualization of these specific features on the CT image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Even before carotid angiography, we can suspect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> for finding these specific features on the CT image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carotid angiography has been the only method of diagnosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Instead of this invasive examination, computed cerebral angiotomography is useful in detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> conveniently and non-invasively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we may conclude that computed cerebral angiotomography is very useful method for screening and follow up study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
