<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Prevention of rebleeding is the most important aspect of the management of hemorrhagic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, because rebleeding causes significant morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 26-year-old male patient with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> since the age of 3 years and multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> was in a semicomatose state at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He was found to have intraventricular and periventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> abutting the atrium of the right ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>His hospital course was complicated by a second <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> events were believed to be secondary to a ruptured right lateral posterior choroidal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was excised and revealed histopathology consistent with a true saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Frameless stereotactic guidance was used during surgery to minimize damage to collateral vessels and to shorten the surgical corridor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The management of hemorrhagic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> should be modified based on the source of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and its relation to a specifically located <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> arising from the choroidal artery, the general belief is that most of these represent pseudoaneurysms and have a tendency to regress spontaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because of the rebleeding risk, we recommend early intervention in treating ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> using the least invasive surgical techniques </plain></SENT>
