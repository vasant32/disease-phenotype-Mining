<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> still remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to explore the role of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a strong inducer of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, in development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 39 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (24 children and 15 adults), 6 control patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008480'>cervical spondylosis</z:hpo>, and 7 control patients with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CSF level of HGF was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated the distribution of HGF and its cellular receptor c-Met in the carotid fork obtained from 2 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and 2 control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CSF level of HGF was 408.2+/-201.6 pg/mL and 443.2+/-193.5 pg/mL in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008480'>cervical spondylosis</z:hpo> and internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, respectively (mean+/-SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, CSF level of HGF was 820.3+/-319.0 pg/mL in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, being significantly higher than those in 2 control groups (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both HGF and c-Met were widely distributed in the media and thickened intima of the carotid fork in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> but not in control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that HGF is densely found in the carotid fork, and its CSF level is markedly elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, suggesting that HGF may be a key protein for pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
