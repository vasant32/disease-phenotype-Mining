<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Developed ischaemic brain damage in the prefrontal area may lead to poor intellectual outcome and restrict patients' daily lives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, extensive cerebral revascularization in both the ischaemic anterior and middle cerebral artery territories is mandatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe the long-term follow-up results for intellectual outcome and performance status and make an evaluation of regional cerebral haemodynamics after extensive omental transplantation spread over both frontal lobes performed as the initial management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the past 10 years, 10 moyamoya patients less than 12 years of age consecutively underwent omental transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The omental flap was spread over not only the symptomatic hemisphere but also the contralateral frontal lobe after a large craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis was accomplished simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the contralateral hemisphere, STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis combined with encephalomyosynangiosis was subsequently performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical observation period averaged 6.7 years (ranged 1.9 to 9.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Apart from 2 patients in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo> had been disclosed pre-operatively, full-scale intelligence quotient scores have been maintained at over 90, that is, within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intellectual range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With respect to quality of life (QOL), these 8 patients have been leading <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> daily lives since the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The focal decrease in CBF observed in the frontal lobe pre-operatively in 7 cases had disappeared after surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In these patients, serial post-operative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography revealed developed omental vessels and STAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Deterioration of intellectual functions and QOL as well as cerebral ischaemic events in paediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients can be prevented by extensive omental transplantation spread over both frontal lobes combined with STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis </plain></SENT>
