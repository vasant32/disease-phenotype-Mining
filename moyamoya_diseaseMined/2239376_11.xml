<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A study has been made of the cerebral blood flow (CBF) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> from the perspective of hemispheric cerebral blood flow and regional CBF (rCBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The material includes 21 children between the ages of 5 and 15 years with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, and 19 adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> cases--<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which had virtually no neurological symptoms at the time of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CBF was measured using the 133Xe intravenous injection method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparison was made with the measurements from 16 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children and 14 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Study was also made of the relationship between the angiographic stage of the disease and the CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the exception of the more elderly patients, CBF was found to be significantly lower in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> cases than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects of the same age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups, the distribution of rCBF showed a dominant posterior distribution, dissimilar to the dominant anterior distribution found in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the juvenile <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> cases, there was a tendency toward decreasing hemispheric blood flow together with advancing disease--as determined angiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, with advancing stages of the disease, there was a continuing transition from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pattern of frontal dominance to one of occipital dominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This dominance of posterior rCBF is thought to be a characteristic feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
