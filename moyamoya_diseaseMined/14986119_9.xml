<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the unusual case of a 2-month-old boy with systemic fibromuscular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (FMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He presented with congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100817'>renovascular hypertension</z:hpo> due to stenosis of the right renal artery, and later developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035085" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal infarction</z:e> on the contralateral side resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The boy subsequently died of intracranial haemorrhage at the age of 14 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the course, hemiconvulsion caused by a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e>-like vascular lesion was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stenotic lesions of both the abdominal aorta and its branches were also revealed by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Post-mortem examination confirmed that the coronary, splenic and mesenteric arteries were also affected and their histological findings were compatible with FMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first congenital case of FMD demonstrating a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapidly progressive</z:hpo> course resulting in a fatal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this case, multivessels in both intracranial and extracranial arteries were involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our case suggests that the nature of fibromuscular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is congenital in origin and its aetiology, at least in some cases, is a systemic abnormality of vascular development </plain></SENT>
