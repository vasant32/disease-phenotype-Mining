<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to identify specific proteins associated with the pathogenesis of MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 20 patients with angiographically confirmed MMD (4 boys and 16 girls; age range, 3 to 13 years; mean, 7.5 years) and 4 control patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo> who underwent selective dorsal rhizotomy (2 boys and 2 girls; age range, 5 to 10 years; mean, 7.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CSF proteins were analyzed by 2-dimensional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis, and protein identification was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of specific CSF protein in patients with MMD was confirmed by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, cerebral CSF was also tested in 7 patients who had other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain diseases</z:e> but no MMD (2 boys and 5 girls; age range, 1 to 12 years; mean, 6.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 1 polypeptide spot (Mr of 13 to 15 kDa and isoelectric point of 5 to 5.5) that was differentially expressed in the CSF samples of MMD patients (mean optical density intensity, 0.36+/-0.24; range, 0.05 to 0.92) and control spinal CSF samples (mean, 0.03+/-0.04; range, 0 to 0.08; P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> was identified as cellular <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi>-binding protein (CRABP)-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High levels of expression of CRABP-I in the CSF from 17 MMD children were confirmed by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of the CSF of MMD patients reveals high CRABP-I expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that the elevation of CRABP-I in CSF may be a candidate for pathogenesis of MMD </plain></SENT>
