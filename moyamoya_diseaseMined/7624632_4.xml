<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A figure-8 coil was designed that was capable of generating currents over a relatively limited area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used the figure-8 coil to localize human cerebral motor cortex by transcranial magnetic stimulation and assessed its value as a diagnostic tool for neurosurgical disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subjects were 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers and 12 neurosurgical patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The points obtaining a response were plotted and the response area was delineated for each stimulus output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rectangular coordinates were subsequently determined for the C3-Cz-C4 line with the stimulation sites set 1.0 cm apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then amplitude and latency maps were displayed by a computer wave map program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers, the posterior margin of the site where a threshold +5% stimulus obtained a response from the THE or ADM muscles almost coincided with the central sulcus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The optimal areas were relatively narrow on the amplitude and latency maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the patient with a left frontal convexity <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo>, the left threshold +5% area for the THE and ADM muscles showed marked anterolateral shift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No threshold map could be obtained on the affected side in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic tumor</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009592'>astrocytoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Low perfusion areas caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> produced narrowing of the optimal zone on the threshold map of the affected side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hyperexcitability of the motor cortex was recognized in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Transcranial focal magnetic stimulation is a useful noninvasive diagnostic method for identification of the human cerebral motor cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It provides important information about changes in the localization and excitability of the motor cortex in neurosurgical patients and should be helpful for treatment planning </plain></SENT>
