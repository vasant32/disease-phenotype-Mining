<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare the diagnostic image quality resulting from three contrast agent dose regimens for 3.0-T high-spatial-resolution three-dimensional magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) angiography of the supraaortic arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained; informed consent was waived for this HIPAA-compliant study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred twenty consecutive patients who underwent 3.0-T three-dimensional high-spatial-resolution contrast material-enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography of the supraaortic arteries with an identical acquisition protocol were assigned to either the high-dose (0.154 mmol per kilogram of body weight), intermediate-dose (0.097 mmol/kg), or low-dose (0.047 mmol/kg) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two readers evaluated resulting images for arterial definition, venous contamination, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="50807">CNR</z:chebi>) were evaluated at six consistent sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed with the Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon signed rank, and analysis of variance tests and the kappa coefficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Readers 1 and 2 scored vascular definition as excellent or sufficient for diagnosis in 1311 of 1360 segments and in 1313 of 1360 segments in the high-dose group (kappa = 0.73), in 1321 of 1354 and in 1319 of 1354 segments in the intermediate-dose group (kappa = 0.77), and in 1322 of 1350 and in 1320 of 1350 segments in the low-dose group (kappa= 0.66), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003838" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Arterial occlusive disease</z:e> was detected by reader 1 in 52, 27, and 98 segments in the high-, intermediate-, and low-dose groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003838" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Arterial occlusive disease</z:e> was detected by reader 2 in 48, 25, and 100 segments in high-, intermediate-, and low-dose groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant difference existed among the three groups regarding arterial definition scores (reader 1, P = .21; reader 2, P = .25) and venous contamination scores (reader 1, P = .38; reader 2, P = .35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SNRs and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50807">CNRs</z:chebi> were lower in the low-dose group (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: At 3.0 T, high-spatial-resolution <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography of the supraaortic arteries can be performed with contrast agent doses as low as 0.047 mmol/kg, without compromising image quality, acquisition speed, or spatial resolution </plain></SENT>
