<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present two patients with thromboembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> associated with unusual complications probably caused by disseminated fibromuscular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (FMD) or FMD-like vascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intimal fibroplasia, which is typical of the vascular lesions associated with FMD, was observed in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of such intimal lesions suggests that there was a systemic factor that caused the formation of recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in the systemic vessels in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These cases are the first ones reported in which an association between FMD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> has been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in our patients was thought to be recurrent pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolisms</z:hpo> resulting from FMD </plain></SENT>
