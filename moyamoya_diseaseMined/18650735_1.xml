<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because scalp vascularity is severely compromised after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> surgery, reconstruction of defects with local scalp tissue is challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To cover defects, a flap is needed that is highly vascularized and has great mobility and territory to avoid existing scars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After tracing ipsilateral occipital artery, an advancement flap that was based on occipital artery and vein was designed to fit the defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The flap was elevated in the subperiosteal layer and advanced without tension to cover the defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Occipital pedicle V-Y advancement flaps were used in 7 patients who had scalp <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of the parietotemporal area and a mean defect size of 8.7 cm </plain></SENT>
