<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We quantified the rCBF and regional vascular reserve (CVR) in adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> before and after surgery using <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> I 123 SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The patient population included 5 adult patients with ages at presentation ranging between 23 and 42 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, whereas 4 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before surgery, the mean resting rCBF and mean CVR in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes of the surgically treated hemisphere were 40.09, 39.50, and 36.9 mL/100 g per minute and 15.39%, 27.09%, and 28.92%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After surgery, the rCBF increased significantly (P = .0002, .0005, and .0062), but in a CVR evaluation, only the frontal lobe increased significantly (P = .0055) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the unaffected hemispheres, the mean resting rCBF significantly increased only in the frontal lobe (P = 038) and no significant increase in the CVR was observed after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients who showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0853404" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">steal phenomenon</z:e> induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> administration, CVR significantly increased not only in the frontal lobe but also in the parietal and temporal lobe after surgery, although the CVR in these areas significantly decreased both before and after surgery in comparison to the mean CVR in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The frontal lobe showed severe hemodynamic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cerebral hemodynamics in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> improved after surgical intervention, especially in severely damaged patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Split-dose (123)I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> SPECT was therefore found to be a useful diagnostic modality for quantifying the hemodynamics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
