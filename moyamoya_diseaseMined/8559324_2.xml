<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two of the children underwent bilateral extracranial-intracranial bypass operations because of ischemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the operations, a profuse pial arterial network was observed, which was considered to be the origin of the enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ischemic episodes disappeared after the operations, and the follow-up <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images showed marked reduction of the leptomeningeal enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of the three patients had an extracranial-intracranial bypass operation on one side, but postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images have not yet been obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We named this finding on postcontrast <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images "ivy sign," because it resembles ivy creeping on stones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ivy sign seems to be a unique, characteristic feature of the pial network observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
