<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The right carotid arteriogram shows the typical internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> at the syphon, whith an abnormal vascular network at the base of the brain; the right anterior and middle cerebral arteries fill from the vascular network and through meningocortical anastomoses; the right posterior communicating and cerebral arteries are tortuous and hypertrophic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The left carotid arteriogram shows <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the common and internal carotid arteries; both anterior and middle cerebral arteries fill from this side; the anterior communicating artery is thick (foetal type) and a median anterior cerebral artery to the corpus callosum is present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is the authors' view that the "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e>" disease is a congenital one, since the abnormal vascular network at the base of the brain would not be necessary, in this case, to preserve good collateral circulation to the right cerebral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No other case with the typical findings of "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e>" disease on one side and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the carotid arteries on the other was found in the literature </plain></SENT>
