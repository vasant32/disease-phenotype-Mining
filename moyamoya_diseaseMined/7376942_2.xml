<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The postoperative angiograms revealed that the STA was rapidly irrigating the territory of the middle cerebral artery including those regions that had been filled preoperatively via different networks of collaterals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore prompt venous drainage was seen to occur postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following surgery EEG analyses revealed considerable increase in the electrical brain activity, and neurological examinations showed reversal of neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dependence of the postoperative neurological improvement on the increased cerebral blood supply through the new collateral channel could be demonstrated by the effect of temporary occlusion of the STA on the electrical brain activity </plain></SENT>
