<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To examine the incidence, clinical and radiologic findings, and response to treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100817'>renovascular hypertension</z:hpo> (RVHT) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis of medical records in six RVHT cases (8.3%) among 72 MMD patients observed from November 1987 to December 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MMD ranged from 9 months to 7 years 1 month (mean, 3.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common initial manifestation of MMD was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was detected between 4 years 4 months and 12 years 3 months (mean, 7.87 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unstimulated plasma renin activity was elevated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Renal ultrasonography and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi> 99m-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid scan showed abnormal findings in four of five and in three of four available studies, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, both imaging studies showed abnormal findings only in the most severely affected kidneys even with bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001920'>renal artery stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Renal arteriography revealed bilateral lesions in three of the patients and unilateral lesions in the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Renal angioplasty was performed in four cases but was successful in only one and partially successful in another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A renal artery specimen obtained during renal autotransplantation showed intimal fibroplasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At the last follow-up, one patient had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood pressure without the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive agents</z:chebi>, but the other five patients needed this medication to control blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Because RVHT may be more commonly associated with MMD than has hitherto been appreciated, it is recommended that blood pressure be carefully followed and that diagnostic procedures for RVHT be carried out in hypertensive patients with MMD </plain></SENT>
