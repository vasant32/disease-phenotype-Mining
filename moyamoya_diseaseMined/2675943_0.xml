<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently the extra-intracranial (EC/IC) arterial bypass operation has been introduced in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> and excellent postoperative outcomes have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the cerebral hemodynamic changes after the bypass surgery, ultrasonic Doppler flowmetry was performed in 10 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their surgical treatments included superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis or encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The flow velocity and pattern of the major cerebral arteries and STAs, the donor artery of the bypass, were studied both before and after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of Doppler flowmetry were compared with clinical symptoms and angiographical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Though the Doppler sonography of the major cerebral arteries showed little change, the flow velocity of the STAs revealed a pronounced and rapid increase after the bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The flow pattern of the STAs, which was of the external carotid type preoperatively, changed to the internal carotid type postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These ultrasonic Doppler findings were thought to be due to a decrease in the peripheral vascular resistance, and suggested a good patency of the bypass arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results of the Doppler flowmetry were in good agreement with clinical and EEG improvement and the findings of the postoperative cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that ultrasonic Doppler flowmetry is a noninvasive and reliable method of assessing the function of the EC/IC bypass in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
