<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, efficacy of drug therapy was reevaluated by an appearance of beta-blockers and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> and the number of patients applied to operation was decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further, since <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> was widely used in clinical practice from the end of 1970s, surgical therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100817'>renovascular hypertension</z:hpo> was hardly or never considered </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recently, we encountered 2 cases of bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100817'>renovascular hypertension</z:hpo> and reevaluated the necessity of surgical therapy during the course of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first case was in a 43-year-old male, for whose bilateral renovascular stenosis a bilateral <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One year later a complete occlusion of the right renal artery and re-stenosis of the left renal artery developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, removal of the right kidney and the auto-transplantation of the left kidney were conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The second case was in a 17-year-old female with bilateral renovascular stenosis complicated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moya-moya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> was conducted for the left kidney with shorter range of stenosis and auto-transplantation was conducted for the right kidney with longer range of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prognosis was favorable in both cases and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was cured or improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We recognized and re-evaluated the necessity of surgical therapy for patients who were unsuccessful to <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> or patients with bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100817'>renovascular hypertension</z:hpo> from our experience and literatures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
