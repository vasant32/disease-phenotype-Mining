<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The definition of combined bypass surgery is a combination of superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis and indirect anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Development of collateral circulation after surgery was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty three patients (58 hemispheres) with MMD were followed by cerebral angiography for at least six months after surgery, between May 2002 and July 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indirect and combined revascularization surgeries were performed in 33 and 25 cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Good outcome was defined as more than group B, in accordance with the method suggested by Matsushima </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Development of collateral circulation was not affected by sex (p = 0.493), clinical features (p = 0.206), or Suzuki stage (p = 0.428) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on postoperative cerebral angiography, the combined bypass surgery group showed a better angiographic outcome, than the encephaloduroarteriomyosynangiosis (EDAMS) group (p = 0.100, odds ratio [OR] 4.107, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.700 - 24.096) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combined bypass group showed a better response than the encephaloduroarteriogaleosynangiosis (EDAGS) group (p = 0.088, OR 4.600, 95% CI 0.721 - 29.332) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similar responses were observed for EDAGS and EDAMS (p = 0.886, OR 1.120, 95% CI 0.239 - 5.251) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The combined bypass group showed a better response than the indirect group (p = 0.064, OR 4.313, 95% CI 0.840 - 22.130) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Results of this study demonstrate that combined bypass results in better revascularization on angiographic evaluation in adult MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, among surgical procedures, combined bypass is a choice that can be recommended </plain></SENT>
