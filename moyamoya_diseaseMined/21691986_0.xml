<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The benefits of revascularisation surgery have only been proven in the juvenile version of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, early revascularisation may prevent irreversible ischaemic deficits and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapidly progressive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> in young patients.From 1984 to 2009, a total of 19 children (mean age 8 years, range 1-18 years, female predominance 2:1, 17/19 European white patients, 2/19 Asian origin of at least one parent) were treated for juvenile <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> by surgical revascularisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The leading symptoms were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> (17/19), followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) or prolonged reversible ischaemic neurologic deficits (PRIND) (15/19) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> (11/19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography showed a clear neovascularisation in the majority of patients after indirect bypasses after 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 17 years and 3 months (maximum 25 years, minimum 2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients were lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In accordance with the literature, ischaemic symptoms were eliminated by the revascularisation operation in 94% of our patients with a very low rate of complications, and no lasting morbidity and mortality in any of the patients.Early diagnosis and surgical treatment seem to potentiate the benefits independently of the type of revascularisation procedure </plain></SENT>
