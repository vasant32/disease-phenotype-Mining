<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: It has been noted that the posterior circulation serves as an important source of collateral blood supply in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since most of the literature has focused on non-operative cases and many symptomatic patients receive surgical revascularization, we evaluated the posterior circulation changes after revascularization and found that progressive posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) steno-occlusive changes after revascularization caused cerebral hemodynamic compromise and clinical deterioration in a significant portion of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> patients with ischemic presentation who received revascularization with complete angiography and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> CT during a minimum of 3 years' clinical follow-up were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Revascularization was performed in 38 hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre- and postoperative angiography were reviewed to determine the internal carotid artery (ICA) stage, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> stage, leptomeningeal collateral (LMC) grade, and Matsushima synangiosis grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The postoperative regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral vascular reserve (CVR) were recorded and correlated with angiographic findings and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Progression of ICA staging was noted in 23 sides (55.2%), and progression of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> staging was noted in 18 sides (47.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 18 cases of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> stage progression, an associated decrease in LMC grade was noted in 12 sides (66.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These changes were associated with decreased regional CBF and CVR, which also explained the recurrent ischemic symptoms in 27.8% of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, LMC grade increased in 15 (65.2%) sides of patients with ICA progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Progressive steno-occlusive change in the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> after revascularization is associated with a reduction in LMC blood flow and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon might cause recurrent ischemic symptoms in 27.8% of patients </plain></SENT>
