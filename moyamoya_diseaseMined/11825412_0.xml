<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The mean follow-up period was 15.5 years (range 8 - 19 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results were obtained from the pre- and postoperative cerebral angiographic examination, MRI, CT, cerebrovascular Doppler ultrasonography, Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), intelligence quotient (IQ) as classified by Taft and neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Of the 226 patients with childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, 64 (28%) recovered in completely, 69 (31%) in improved markedly, and 46 (20%) improved slightly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>43 patients (19%) had no changes and 4 (2%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effective rate of the operation was 79% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The modified direct anastomosis and encephalo-myo-arterio-synagiosis played a role in this improvement by increasing CBF after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation is found between the postoperative effect and the stages of preoperative angiograms </plain></SENT>
