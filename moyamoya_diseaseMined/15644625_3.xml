<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, alternative mechanisms, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> in low-flow territories, may also contribute to clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of high-intensity transient signals (HITS) and the degree of hemodynamic compromise were studied in symptomatic patients with MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four patients (17 female, 7 male; mean age 33 +/- 13 years) with clinical symptoms attributable to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and the angiographic features of MMD (21 definite form, 3 probable MMD; 22 patients 'late stage' MMD, 2 patients 'early stage' MMD) in 45 affected hemispheres were enrolled in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent parallel estimation of hemodynamic compromise by means of functional blood flow (rCBF) studies using SPECT, PET or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-CT and HITS detection by TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hemodynamic compromise was observed in 37/40 (92%) hemispheres studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During TCD monitoring, HITS were detected in 3 patients (12.5%), with a total frequency of 3 (6.6%) in the 45 hemispheres investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with HITS showed hemodynamic compromise in functional rCBF studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In these patients, HITS were recorded ipsilateral to the symptomatic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HITS occurred in late stage MMD patients only once, while both cases with early stage MMD demonstrated multiple HITS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of HITS in patients with MMD appears to be lower compared to patients with atherosclerotic or atherothrombotic arterial obstructions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-related symptoms in 'late stage' MMD seem to be caused by hemodynamic compromise in the majority of these patients </plain></SENT>
