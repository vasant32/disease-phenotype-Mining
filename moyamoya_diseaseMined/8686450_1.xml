<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is not clear whether the revascularization prevents future <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> from the residual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to investigate perioperative morphological and hemodynamic changes in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four pediatric patients (age &lt; 15 years old) with bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were selected for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To quantify the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels, T1-weighted transverse images at the level of the basal ganglia and the thalamus were selected and characteristic flow voids in the lentiform nucleus were counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Resting CBF and cerebrovascular reserve capacity (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) were measured pre- and 1 year after surgery using <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">Xenon</z:chebi>-CT CBF method with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ratio of deep CBF/cortical CBF was calculated as an index of hemodynamic stress distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The one-year follow-up studies showed that 1) the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels decreased on the operative side, but did not change on the non-operative sides in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases; 2) the ratio of deep CBF/cortical CBF decreased on the operative sides, but did not change in the non-operative sides; and 3) the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> increased on both sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This observation suggests the possibility that revascularization surgery may be effective for preventing the future risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
