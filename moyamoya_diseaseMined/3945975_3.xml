<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The brain is surrounded by concentric collateral networks but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these networks are not available as collaterals in the early stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The anatomical characteristics precluding their early use include the presence of the watery layer of subarachnoid fluid between the cortical and dural vessels and of a closed bony box intervening between the dural and scalp arterial networks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These barriers isolate the brain from the abundant blood flow of the external carotid system as if they were the moat (the subarachnoid fluid layer) and the walls (the skull) of a castle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on these concepts, we have developed a surgical procedure, the encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This operation surmounts the above mentioned two obstacles to collateral formation to the brain by perforating the castle wall and bridging the moat by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_183'>granulation tissue</z:mpath>, without injuring the collaterals which are already formed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This procedure was performed on 70 sides in 38 pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Revascularisation of the brain was obtained in 100 percent of the cases with varying improvement in the symptoms </plain></SENT>
