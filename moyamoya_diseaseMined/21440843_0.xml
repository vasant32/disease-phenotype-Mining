<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This tissue microarray study included 24 cases of superficial temporal artery samples, 15 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e>, and 9 cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> arteries as control, and bFGF immunofluorescence assay was applied to test the samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number of positive cells and total cells of the muscular layer and the endothelium layer were counted separately in every picture, the positive rates were calculated, and the experimental data were analyzed statistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The bFGF immunofluorescence staining of smooth muscular layer cells, intima cells and endothelial cells from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> group were obviously stronger than that from the control group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The enhancement expression of bFGF in the Moyamaya disease group implicates that bFGF plays an important part in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
