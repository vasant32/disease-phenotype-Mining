<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ring finger 213 (RNF213) was previously identified as the strongest susceptibility gene for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in East Asian people by a genome-wide linkage analysis and exome analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The coding variant p.R4810K in RNF213 was strongly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in the Japanese (odds ratio: 338.94, p = 1.05 × 10(-100)) and Korean (odds ratio: 135.63, p = 7.59 × 10(-27)) populations, and much less strongly associated in the Chinese population (odds ratio: 14.70, p = 2.63 × 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the distribution of variant p.R4810K in RNF213 in 2,508 participants from East and Southeast Asian countries using a TaqMan probe. p.R4810K was detected at an allele frequency of about 1.00% in 4 of 11 investigated locations in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, p.R4810K was detected homogeneously at relatively high frequencies of 1.00-1.72% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> investigated locations in Korea and Japan, including Okinawa. p.R4810K was not detected in Southeast Asian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The population susceptible to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> was estimated to be 16.16 million people in East Asian countries, including 11.41 million Chinese, 1.36 million Korean, and 3.39 million Japanese people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, which was estimated at approximately one per 300 carriers of p.R4810K, was considered to be 53,800 in East Asian populations </plain></SENT>
