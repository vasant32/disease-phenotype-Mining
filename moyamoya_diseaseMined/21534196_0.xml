<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Indirect surgical procedures have been increasingly used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, indirect surgical intervention methods especially used in combination with pial synangiosis were assessed together with other indirect methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: 11 patients who were treated with an indirect bypass procedures at our clinic and followed for at least three years were retrospectively examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>19 surgical interventions were performed for 18 patient hemispheres pertaining to these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>4 indirect surgical revascularization methods were used for three patient hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, indirect procedures combined with pial synangiosis were applied in 11 operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the "multiple burr-hole surgery" method was used in 4 four operations performed for two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The clinical success rate was 66.6% for patients where the techniques were applied with pial synangiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No new ischemic or hemorrhagic attack was observed during the follow-up period in any of these patients in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pial synangiosis is a modification that Increases the success rate of indirect surgical methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, high success rates have been reported in recent publications related to multiple burr-hole surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This method is a candidate choice of surgical intervention for selected patients </plain></SENT>
