<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is well known that the electroencephalographic finding in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> demonstrates the characteristic "re-build up" phenomenon a few minutes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the usefulness of an electroencephalogram (EEG) in the postoperative management of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, we studied the presence or absence of improvement in the clinical, single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) and EEG findings, before and after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients, who underwent indirect revascularization surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, were included in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical improvement was assessed as the disappearance or decrease of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings on the EEG and SPECT were considered improved when the re-build up phenomenon was absent and when there was improvement in the cerebrovascular reserve as a result of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The statistical correlation analysis for both clinical and EEG improvement were consistent (kappa value=0.409, p&lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the result from the clinical and SPECT improvement as well as that from EEG and SPECT improvement were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that EEG can be used as a noninvasive and simple follow-up test for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> after indirect revascularization surgery if the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> procedure is effectively performed during EEG recording </plain></SENT>
