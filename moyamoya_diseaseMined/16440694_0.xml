<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mechanical irritation to trachea resulting in pain,cough,and increase in secretion after termination of the general anesthesia sometimes occurs and it sometimes causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> resulting in hypocapnea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Continuous hypocapnea sometimes causes appearance of ischemic attacks in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examine cerebral angiography conducted under general anesthesia using face mask ventilation in fourteen children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">Sevoflurane</z:chebi> was used as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38870">inhalation anesthetics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Face mask anesthesia was sixteen times in total in the 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography terminated uneventfully in these patients except one patient who showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006266" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bronchospasm</z:e> after induction of anesthesia and required tracheal intubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the patient showed uneventful course after termination of the angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tracheal irritation did not appear and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients were asleep just after termination of face mask anesthesia except for the patient who required tracheal intubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the latter case, the patient frequently coughed out phlegm after general anesthesia with tracheal intubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, general anesthesia with face mask ventilation was thought to be one of the suitable <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> methods introduced for cerebral angiography in childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
