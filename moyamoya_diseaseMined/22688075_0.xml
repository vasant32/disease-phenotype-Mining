<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, CCD due to cerebral hyperperfusion following cerebrovascular reconstruction is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 61-year-old woman presented with transient CCD due to cerebral hyperperfusion following bypass surgery for adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She developed transient <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of the right extremities and was diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First, she underwent superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis with indirect synangiosis on the left </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperative course was uneventful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, she underwent STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis with indirect synangiosis on the right </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>She complained of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> on the right, and single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) performed on the 7th postoperative day demonstrated hyperperfusion in the right frontal and temporal lobes associated with hypoperfusion in the left cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging demonstrated no new lesions and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography showed patent STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subsequent SPECT showed disappearance of both hyperperfusion and CCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This case strongly suggests that cerebral hyperperfusion after bypass surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> may cause transient CCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although the clinical significance is still obscure, this phenomenon indicates the cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathway is interrupted due to hyperperfusion, suggesting the development of hyperperfusion syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Careful observation of cerebral hemodynamics after bypass surgery is warranted to avoid hyperperfusion-related complications </plain></SENT>
