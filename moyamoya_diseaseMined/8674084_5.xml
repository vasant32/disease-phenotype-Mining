<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rebuild-up phenomenon, slowing of waves on electroencephalogram (EEG) seen after cessation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> (HV), is one of the characteristic phenomena of the disease and is thought to be related to a development of its symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the mechanism involved in the rebuild-up phenomenon to clarify the mechanism of development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were studied; they ranged in age from 7 to 17 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The power spectra of the EEGs in the occipital region were obtained with a Berg Fourier EEG analyzer for quantitative analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arterial blood gas change (pH, PaO2, PaCO2), respiratory pattern (abdominal and nasal), tidal volume and respiratory rate were analyzed simultaneously every 30 s-1 min before, during, and after HV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The slow wave power spectrum (rebuild-up) increased and symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> developed as a result of the sharp decrease in PaO2 (PaO2 60.5 +/- 15.4 mmHg) after cessation of HV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on the fact that hypoxemia was playing a main role, 100% oxygen was administered at a rate of 0.5 l/min in 4 cases where the rebuild-up phenomenon was clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The EEG power spectra and arterial blood gas were analyzed during rebuild-up with and without O2 administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of O2 administration at the beginning of rebuild-up as measure to prevent the symptoms was checked by a recovery rate of slow wave power percentage, a recovery time of slow wave power percent and by clinical observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The recovery rates were 11.8 +/- 4.2%/min and 5.5 +/- 4.0%/min with and without O2 inhalation, respectively (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Recovery times of slow wave power percentage were 4.3 +/- 1.8 min and 8.1 +/- 1.2 min with and without O2 inhalation, respectively (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, oxygen administration soon after the cessation of HV was shown to be effective in eliminating the rebuild-up phenomenon and hence in abolishing its symptoms </plain></SENT>
