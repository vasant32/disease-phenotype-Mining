<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to every French neuropaediatric academic centre to estimate the prevalence, incidence, familial form rate and location of paediatric MMD/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specific paediatric data were also retrieved from the most recent nationwide Japanese study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A 100% response rate was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of paediatric MMD/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> was estimated at 0.39/100,000 children (95% CI: 0.28-0.49), and the incidence was estimated at 0.065/100,000 children/year (95% CI: 0.025-0.12), with 7.5% familial cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence was homogenous within the different administrative areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive survey of MMD/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> in academic neuropaediatric centres suggests that the prevalence of the disease in children in France is approximately 1/20th of that estimated in Asia </plain></SENT>
