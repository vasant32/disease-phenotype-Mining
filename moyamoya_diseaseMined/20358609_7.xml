<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Features include <z:hpo ids='HP_0008846'>severe intrauterine growth retardation</z:hpo> (IUGR), poor postnatal growth (adult stature approximately 100 cm), severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo>, characteristic facial features, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intelligence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved registry was created and currently follows 25 patients with a diagnosis of MOPD II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on previous studies, a neurovascular screening program was implemented and 13 (52%) of these patients have been found to have cerebral neurovascular abnormalities including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> pathogenesis begins with vessel narrowing in the supraclinoid internal carotid artery, anterior cerebral (A1) or middle cerebral (M1) artery segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The narrowing may predominate initially on one side, progresses to bilateral stenosis, with subsequent occlusion of the vessels and collateral formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We present four patients who, on neurovascular screening, were found to have cerebrovascular changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two were asymptomatic, one presented with a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002587'>projectile vomiting</z:hpo> related to a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and one presented after an apparent decline in cognitive functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the registry suggests screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> be performed at the time of MOPD II diagnosis and at least every 12-18 months using MRA or computerized tomographic angiography (CTA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We believe this is imperative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If diagnosed early enough, re-vascularization and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> treatment in skilled hands can be performed safely and prevent or minimize long-term sequelae in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Emergent evaluation is also needed when other neurologic or cardiac symptoms are present </plain></SENT>
