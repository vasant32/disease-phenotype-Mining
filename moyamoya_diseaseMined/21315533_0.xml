<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively compared the use of ASL-MRI and single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT (SPECT) imaging to determine absolute cerebral blood flow (CBF) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: CBF examinations using ASL-MRI on 3-T MRI and SPECT imagings with <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-123-N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-iodoamphetamine at resting (rest-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>) and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge (ACZ-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>) were performed on 12 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (men, 5; women, 7; age range/average (year), 7-66/35.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CBF values determined by ASL-MRI (ASL-value), rest-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> (rest-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-value), and ACZ-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> (ACZ-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-value) of cerebral hemispheres (24 sides) were measured with normalized CBF maps created from data of those 3 perfusion imaging methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) was calculated as follows: {(ACZ-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-value)-(rest-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-value)}/(rest-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-value)×100 (%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ASL-value was compared with the rest-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-value, ACZ-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-value, and CVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ASL-value, rest-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-value, ACZ-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-value, and CVR (average±standard deviation) were 26.6±14.8 (mL/100 g/min), 27.5±6.4 (mL/100 g/min), 37.1±13.2 (mL/100 g/min), and 35.9±44.3 (%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant relationships between the ASL-value versus (vs.) the rest-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-value (rs=0.500, p&lt;0.05), the ASL-value vs. the ACZ-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-value (rs=0.863, p&lt;0.01), and the ASL-value vs. the CVR (rs=0.699, p&lt;0.01) were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the ASL-value was lower than the rest-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-value, the significant relationship between the ASL-value and the rest-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-value may suggest that perfusion imaging by ASL-MRI could be used to recognize the condition of brain perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In particular, the stronger correlation coefficient between the ASL-value and ACZ-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-value might suggest that perfusion imaging by ASL-MRI could show the potentially dangerous zone for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
