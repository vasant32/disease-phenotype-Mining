<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the optimal procedure has not yet been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study compared the efficacy of performing bifrontal encephalogaleosynangiosis (EGS) using a craniotomy with performing EGS using bur holes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors retrospectively analyzed surgical results of pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> treated using encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS) and bifrontal EGS with a craniotomy, or EGS with bur holes, for the purpose of improving the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of the ACA territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients' demographic data, clinical presentations, surgical therapies, and clinical outcomes were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine patients underwent EDAS with bifrontal EGS using a craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients underwent EDAS with EGS using bur holes for 5 cerebral hemispheres (1 bur hole in 2 hemispheres, 2 bur holes in 2 hemispheres, and 3 bur holes in 1 hemisphere) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 46.8 months (range 7-96 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preoperative symptoms improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The collateral circulation in the ACA territory made by EGS was divided into 3 groups according to postoperative angiography results: Group A (revascularization of more than two-thirds of the ACA territory), Group B (revascularization between one-third and two-thirds), and Group C (revascularization less than one-third) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of 5 hemispheres treated with EGS using bur holes, 1 was evaluated as Group B and 4 as Group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of 18 hemispheres treated with bifrontal EGS using a craniotomy, 8 were evaluated as Group A, 7 as Group B, and 3 as Group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The patients who underwent bifrontal EGS using a craniotomy showed significantly better revascularization than those who underwent EGS using bur holes (p = 0.0065) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow in the ACA territory improved in 13 (92.9%) of 14 hemispheres in patients treated with bifrontal EGS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only 3 (60%) of 5 hemispheres demonstrated an increase of CBF in patients treated with EGS using bur holes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A trend was demonstrated for better improvement with bifrontal EGS (p = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis with bifrontal EGS using a craniotomy demonstrated better revascularization and improvement of CBF in the ACA territory than with EGS using bur holes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Bifrontal EGS using a craniotomy is considered to be a simple, safe, and effective surgical procedure for improvement of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of the ACA territory in pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
