<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date only 4 case reports on intracranial angioplasty or stenting as treatment of this disease exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present 5 adult patients with MMD who failed angioplasty and/or stenting who remained symptomatic despite endovascular treatment or presented with recurrent symptoms and recurrence of stenosis/occlusion on angiography requiring subsequent extracranial-intracranial revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five adult MMD patients who underwent endovascular treatment with angioplasty or stenting were referred for further evaluation and treatment from outside hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were collected from clinical referral notes and angiograms or reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent repeat 6-vessel cerebral angiography to assess the extent of disease and results of prior endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six endovascular procedures were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Internal carotid artery (ICA) balloon angioplasty and Wingspan stenting was performed in 2 patients (3 arteries) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient had ICA-M1 angioplasty without stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients had M1 angioplasty and Wingspan stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients developed repeat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> following treatment attributable to the vascular territories of endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Repeat endovascular treatment was performed in 3 patients at a mean of 4 months (range = 2-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two went on to a third endovascular treatment due to progression of disease in the angioplastied/stented vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The average time of symptom recurrence after initial endovascular therapy was 1.8 months (0-4 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Follow-up angiography when referred to our institution demonstrated 70-90% instent restenosis of the stented vessel in 3 and occlusion in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Due to persistence of symptoms cerebral revascularization was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MMD is a progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Angioplasty and stenting may temporarily improve the cerebral blood flow and decrease cerebral ischemic events but do not appear to be durable nor provide long-term prevention against future ischemic events </plain></SENT>
