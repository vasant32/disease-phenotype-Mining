<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the incidence of neurologic complications of cerebral angiography in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi>) as compared to children without <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Materials and methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One-hundred-ninety consecutive cerebral angiograms obtained in 152 children were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty of these angiograms were obtained in 40 children with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent neurologic evaluation prior to and after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For this study, a neurologic complication was defined as any new focal neurologic deficit or alteration in mental status occurring during the procedure or within the ensuing 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 2 neurologic complications within 24 hours of angiography, one in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> group and one in the non-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> became mute following angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The symptom resolved within 12 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient without <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> being examined postoperatively for residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> requiring reexploration 12 hours after the angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Using a two-tail Fisher's exact test, there was no significant statistical difference in the ischemic (P = 0.3) or hemorrhagic (P = 1.0) complication rates between the group of patients with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> and the non-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The risk of a neurologic complication from cerebral angiography in children with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> is low and not statistically different from the risk in children with other cerebrovascular disorders </plain></SENT>
