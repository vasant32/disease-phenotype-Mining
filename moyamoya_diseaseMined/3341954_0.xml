<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were predominantly located in the centrum semiovale, in the distal beds of supply of the penetrating branches of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Infarction of the putamen was found in three hemispheres, caudate nucleus in four, globus pallidus in two, and anterior limb of the internal capsule in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were none in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, thalamus, brain stem, or cerebellum </plain></SENT>
