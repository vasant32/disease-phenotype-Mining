<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have carried out basic investigations of an intravenous minimum dose bolus (MinDB) injection method for cerebral computed angiotomography by comparing blood <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> concentrations with high resolution computed tomography (CT) images of cerebral blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the GECT/T 8800 scanner, a MinDB injection of 1 ml/kg of 60% Conray at a rate of 2 ml/s made it possible to increase the blood <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> concentration in the carotid artery to more than 15 mg/ml for about 20 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography performed during this period enabled us to obtain clear images of the circle of Willis, including other main cerebral arteries, deep veins, and cortical and lenticulostriate arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral computed angiotomography using this method should be useful for noninvasive screening or detection of cerebrovascular lesions themselves, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo>, cerebrovascular obstructions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, and should also be useful for determining the anatomical relationship between the cerebral blood vessels and other parenchymal or space occupying lesions </plain></SENT>
