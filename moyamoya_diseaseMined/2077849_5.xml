<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These children first underwent encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis (EDAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because two of the three postoperative collateral formations through EDAS were either poor or not present at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> and their symptoms remained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Encephalo-myo-synangiosis (EMS) was later added in the posterior frontal and/or parietal regions of the same side as the former EDAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the remaining one, the collaterals through EDAS were well formed but <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) persisted in the lower limb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The collateral to the middle cerebral arterial (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) distribution, even though seemingly well formed, was not sufficient to obtain a complete subsidence of the symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this case encephalo-myo-arterio-synangiosis (EMAS) was later added to the antero-medial frontal region of the same side as the EDAS to form collaterals to the anterior cerebral arterial (ACA) distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cases the angiograms after the second operation showed good formation of collaterals, and the symptoms subsided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The causes of poor collateral formation through EDAS and operative techniques for the additional operation for those cases refractory to EDAS are discussed </plain></SENT>
