<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 11 adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> (mean age, 39.6 +/- 7.8 years) and eight patients with atherosclerotic occlusion of the major arterial trunks (mean age, 62.4 +/- 15.4 years) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regions of interest were frontal, temporal and occipital cortex, caudate, putamen and thalamus in each hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e>, local CBF values in the internal carotid artery territory (frontal and temporal cortex, caudate, putamen) were significantly higher than those in the occluded side of patients with atherosclerotic occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Local CO2R values in the caudate and putamen were significantly higher than those in the occluded side of patients with atherosclerotic occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the cerebral hemodynamics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> differ from those of atherosclerotic occlusion of the major cerebral arterial trunks, and may be a result of the abundant collateral circulation through basal '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e>' vessels </plain></SENT>
