<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intracystic therapies have been utilized in some centers to potentially decrease morbidity associated with cystic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_257'>craniopharyngioma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to review the Canadian experience with intracystic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> therapy (ICB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> centers in the Canadian Pediatric <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>Brain Tumor</z:mp> Consortium (CPBTC) were invited to participate in a retrospective review of this treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A questionnaire was sent to each center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data were analyzed at British Columbia's Children's Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 6 of 17 centers utilized ICB and submitted data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 17 of 19 patients with the intention to treat received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twelve were treated at the time of diagnosis, and 5 at the time of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five patients achieved a complete response, 6 achieved a partial response, and 5 achieved a minor response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient was stable for 2.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At the time of last follow-up, 8 patients have not required further intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Complications included transient symptomatic peritumoral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> (2 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000826'>precocious puberty</z:hpo> (1 patient) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000871'>panhypopituitarism</z:hpo> (2 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 4 years (range, 0.5-10.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The median progression-free survival was 1.8 years (range, 0.3-6.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>One patient died of a massive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> secondary to radiation-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ICB was found to be well tolerated in this group of children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>ICB may be a feasible and effective therapy for certain children with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_257'>craniopharyngioma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">Bleomycin</z:chebi> may delay the need for aggressive surgery or radiation therapy for several years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Prospective multiinstitutional clinical trials are required to further evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness, and dose schedules of this treatment </plain></SENT>
