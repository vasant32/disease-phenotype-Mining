<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a considerable number of complications occur, particularly involving the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On rare occasions <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> has been reported following an ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> related to varicella </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL CASE: We report the case of a 4 year old boy who presented with right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> eight days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of varicella </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CAT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> showed a cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> involving the left caudate nucleus, putamen and internal capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other possible causes of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> were ruled out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four years later he had slight residual right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis may have been due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> of the intracranial arteries caused by direct invasion of the vessels by virus from the nearby nerve tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Another theory suggest similarities with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, suggesting that lesions of the head and neck stimulate the superior cervical ganglion and this, together with the production of circulating immuno-complexes may be the cause of the vasculopathy of the intracranial blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In most cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> occurring in childhood the cause is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, it is important to discover the cause since the risk of recurrence often depends on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Once other commoner causes have been excluded, one should ask whether there is a history of varicella, since the prognosis is generally good and recurrence uncommon </plain></SENT>
