<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Limited data exist to guide management of incidentally discovered pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Best exemplified in the setting of unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e>, in which the unaffected side is monitored, this phenomenon also occurs in populations undergoing routine surveillance of the cerebral vasculature for other conditions, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> (SCD) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> Type 1 (NF1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors present their experience with specific syndromic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> populations to better characterize the natural history of radiographic and clinical progression in patients with asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective review of the clinical database of the neurosurgery department at Children's Hospital Boston, including both nonoperative referrals and a consecutive series of 418 patients who underwent surgical revascularization for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> between 1988 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Within the period of time studied, 83 patients were asymptomatic at the time of radiographic diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e>, while also having either unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> in association with either SCD or NF1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age at presentation was 9.1 years (range 1-21 years), and there were 49 female (59%) and 34 male (41%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up duration was 5.4 ± 3.8 years (mean ± SD), with 45 patients (54%) demonstrating radiographic progression and 37 (45%) becoming symptomatic within this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with SCD had the highest incidence of both radiographic (15 patients [75%]) and clinical (13 patients [65%]) progression, followed by NF1 (20 patients [59%] with radiographic progression and 15 patients [44%] with clinical progression) and patients with unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> (10 patients [35%] with radiographic progression and 9 patients [31%] with clinical progression) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Radiographic progression occurred in the majority of asymptomatic patients and generally heralded subsequent clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003676'>progressive disorder</z:hpo>, even in asymptomatic populations, and support the rationale of early surgical intervention to minimize morbidity from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
