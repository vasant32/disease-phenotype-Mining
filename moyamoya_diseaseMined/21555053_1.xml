<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Case records and intraoperative electroencephalography recordings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (n=220) treated with surgical revascularization for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> (pial synangiosis) performed for 14 years (1994-2008) were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Electroencephalographic slowing occurred in 100 cases (45.5%), and was persistent in nine cases (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Slowing coincided with specific operative manipulations, most commonly while suturing the donor vessel to the pia, and during closure of the craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Slowing generally occurred bilaterally, independently of the side of intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence, length, and severity of slowing were not predictive of perioperative ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We present additional data on intraoperative electroencephalography with a modified montage to accommodate the craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although not predictive of perioperative ischemic events in this series, electroencephalographic changes were correlated with specific operative interventions, and revealed global responses to unilateral manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that prospective analyses of this technique may elucidate additional methods of predicting (and possibly preventing) perioperative ischemic events </plain></SENT>
