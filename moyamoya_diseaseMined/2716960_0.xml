<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BAEPs were abnormally prolonged wave I-III and wave III-V in each one (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FVEPs were abnormal in 6 (30%), included prolonged latencies, reduced amplitudes and poor waveform in one each, and delayed latencies as well as reduced amplitudes in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FVEPs significantly correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>intellectual deterioration</z:hpo> (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SSEPs were abnormal in 13 (65%) significantly more frequent than BAEPs and FVEPs (p less than 0.01); reduction of N20 in 7, delayed latencies of N13-N20 in 4, and both delayed latencies and reduced amplitudes of N20 in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings correlated well with the neurologic deficits, CT findings and EEG findings in this progressive cerebrovascular disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e>) in children </plain></SENT>
