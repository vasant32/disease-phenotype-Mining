<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the hematologic risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in a cohort of Saudi children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated children at the Division of Pediatric Neurology at King Khalid University Hospital, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, during the periods July 1992 to February 2001 (retrospective study) and February 2001 to March 2003 (prospective study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Investigations for suspected cases included neuroimaging, transcranial Doppler (TCD) for cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> (SCD), and Duplex scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hemostatic assays included coagulation screening tests, tests of thrombin generation and fibrinolysis, coagulation inhibitors, and activated protein C resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the study period, 104 Saudi children (aged one month to 12 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the cohort was 27.1 months (SD = 39.3 months) and median was 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic strokes</z:hpo> accounted for the majority of cases (76%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A major risk factor was identified in 93 of 104 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (89.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hematologic disorders</z:e> were the most common (46.2%), followed by prothrombic disorders (31.7%); microcytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001931'>hypochromic anemia</z:hpo> (26%); <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> (SCD), or SCbeta(0)-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e>, (11.5%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008533" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor IX deficiency</z:e> (2.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Raised anticardiolipin antibodies (13/49, 26.5%) was the most frequent abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Deficiencies of the natural <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (protein S, protein C and antithrombin III) were as follows: protein S (15/70, 21.4%); protein C (15/70, 21.4%) and combined deficiency of 2 or more inhibitors (9/70, 12.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Activated protein C resistance has not been detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Contrary to the findings of previous studies from Saudi Arabia, SCD is a common risk factor and is severe, as it resulted in multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya syndrome</z:e> was diagnosed in 2 patients with SCD, one of whom had revascularization surgery (encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Assessment of children with SCD at risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was helped by the introduction of TCD followed by neuroimaging, using MRI and magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study strongly highlights the importance of prothrombotic disorders and the severe phenotype of SCD as risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Saudi children </plain></SENT>
