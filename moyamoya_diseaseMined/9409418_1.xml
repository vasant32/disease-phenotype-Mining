<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A review of the surgical and postoperative records of 127 revascularization procedures performed on 82 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> was done to evaluate changes we made in <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> management in response to perioperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From 1982 to 1996, out of 82 children who underwent revascularization surgery at our hospital, five developed perioperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One developed circulatory instability during surgery; the cause seemed to be a depth of anesthesia insufficient for preventing surgical stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To rectify this problem, an increased dose of fentanyl was used to improve the maintenance of anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> during the early postoperative period due, in part, to inadequate management of postoperative pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We began to administer supplemental doses of meperidine to patients after they emerged from anesthesia to provide better control of postoperative pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our review confirmed the effectiveness of these measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that during the perioperative management of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e>, close attention should be paid to balancing the patients' <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> state against surgical stress and providing adequate postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
