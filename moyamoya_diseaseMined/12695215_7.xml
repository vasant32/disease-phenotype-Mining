<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS) has become the main treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, a chronically progressive cerebrovascular occlusive disease in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the utility of perfusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging for evaluating hemodynamic changes before and after EDAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen patients with angiographically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> who underwent EDAS were investigated, and results were compared with those of a control group (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Perfusion <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was performed before and after EDAS by using a T2*-weighted contrast material-enhanced technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and time to peak enhancement (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) maps were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relative ratios of rCBV and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> in the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and basal ganglia were measured and compared with those of the posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changes in hemodynamic parameters between pre- and post-EDAS perfusion maps were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean rCBV ratio of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> in the patient group was slightly higher than that in the control group, without statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 13 patients showed a delayed <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> before EDAS compared with the control group (P =.0006), and the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> after EDAS was significantly reduced (P =.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the basal ganglia, shortening of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> was demonstrated before EDAS, but no significant change was observed after EDAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Perfusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging can be applied for evaluating postoperative changes in cerebral blood flow in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Shortening of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> of the hemisphere operated on is a marker for the development of collateral circulation from the external carotid artery to the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
