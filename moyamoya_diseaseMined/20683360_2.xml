<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, this balance may be disturbed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the thermal pathophysiology of the brain in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study included 12 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and 10 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Temperature was measured by image postprocessing of diffusion-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our noninvasive thermometry showed that the ventricular temperature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> patients was higher than that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean temperature difference of 1.1 degrees C between the two groups was significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> tend to have elevated ventricular temperatures, which may represent a mismatch between cerebral metabolism and perfusion </plain></SENT>
