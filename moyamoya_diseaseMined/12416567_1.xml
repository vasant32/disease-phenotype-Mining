<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The surgical plan required superficial temporal artery (STA)-middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis to be conducted before neck clipping of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> to provide collateral flow via the STA to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> if temporary occlusion of the parent artery of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the anastomotic procedure failed because the STA was occluded at the site of temporary clip application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>End-to-end anastomosis of the STA was planned after excising the occluded site of the STA, but end-to-end anastomosis could not be performed because the donor artery was too short for anastomosis to the branch of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, patch grafting using a piece of wall of the STA was performed to repair the arteriotomy defect in the wall of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, followed by neck clipping of the saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in the posterior circulation via the subtemporal approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vascular reconstruction can be recommended if arterial anastomosis between a superficial skin artery and a branch of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> is impossible due to an intraoperative accident or technical difficulty and reperfusion is necessary </plain></SENT>
