<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Under polytherapy when she was in a life-threatening condition we observed a prompt, dramatic improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since diagnosis was late a permanent defect could not be prevented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> medication has been reported as ineffective in the literature and haemodilution and pentoxyfylline seem to be of dubious benefit, we ascribe the dramatic improvement to the calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The progress made is in our view equal to the progress made after revascularizing operations </plain></SENT>
