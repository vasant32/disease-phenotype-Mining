<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both may present with similar clinical and auxiliary findings, but differentiation is extremely important because they require different treatment regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our cohort included 21 white patients with PCNSV and 21 white patients with MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical and diagnostic features were obtained by retrospective chart review; follow-up information and outcome were obtained prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were compared between patients with PCNSV and MMD using Chi square test or Fisher's exact test for categorical data and Mann-Whitney U test for continuous data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age at symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 42.48 years in PCNSV and 31.0 years in MMD (p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference regarding the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>, which represented an important symptom in both conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conventional cerebral angiography verified correct diagnosis in 13 of 17 patients (76.5%) with PCNSV while angiogram verified correct diagnosis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with MMD (p = 0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MRI and cerebrospinal fluid studies were appropriate to differentiate between the inflammatory and the non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three PCNSV patients and two MMD patients died within documented follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite important pathophysiological and angiographic differences, PCNSV and MMD may present with similar clinical and auxiliary findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An intensive workup including MRI, conventional cerebral angiography and CSF studies is required to avoid misdiagnosis </plain></SENT>
