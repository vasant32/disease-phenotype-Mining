<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its clinical significance, however, is not elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to characterise LMCE on MRI and to evaluate its role in the assessment of circulation through a surgically established bypass in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied 16 patients with idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> (seven males, nine females, includingt four children, aged 7 to 54 years, mean 24 years) who underwent T1-weighted MRI before and after intravenous contrast medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of LMCE, its intensity and anatomical distribution, catheter angiographic findings, and relation of LMCE to the bypass surgery were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More LMCE was seen in the cerebrum in most patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LMCE in the brain stem and cerebellum was minimal, similar to that seen in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LMCE was less prominent following surgery than before operation or in patients who did not undergo surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In three patients examined both before and after operation LMCE became less prominent following bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As LMCE becomes less prominent after "effective" bypass surgery, this may be used for evaluation of effectiveness of surgery in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> </plain></SENT>
