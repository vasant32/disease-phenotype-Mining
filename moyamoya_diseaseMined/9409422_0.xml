<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two branches of the STA were anastomosed to the two cortical arteries which were selected in the watershed area of the cerebral hemisphere estimated as a hypoperfusion area on the preoperative angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before surgery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) developed from every month to every 6 months in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> or sobbing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No perioperative completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or wound complications was observed, although single <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> developed in four patients within 1 month after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postoperative angiogram demonstrated that, not only the preoperative watershed area, but also the most of the middle cerebral artery territory was oppacified via the 2 branches of the STA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 19 hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a mean follow-up period of 4 years, no ischemic episode was induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo>, and there was no mental or neurological deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> double anastomoses, to the cerebral watershed area, in combination with EMS are safe and effective even for younger children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
