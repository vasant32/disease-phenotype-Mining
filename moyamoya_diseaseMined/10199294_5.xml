<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Anastomotic bypass surgery for childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> provides more rapid improvement of blood circulation than indirect non-anastomotic bypass surgery, but there are several problems, such as the technical difficulty of the operation, the extended period of anesthesia, and temporary occlusion of blood flow in the vessels of the brain surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We describe a new non-anastomotic bypass procedure using dural pedicle insertion over the brain surface combined with encephalogaleomyosynangiosis and preservation of the superficial temporal artery (STA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We treated nine patients with childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> admitted to our institution from 1989 through 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The operative field was determined based on the ischemic site identified by preoperative neuroimaging methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our procedure was performed in a total of 15 hemispheres, and the patients have been followed up for 5 months to 5 years after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cerebral angiography, cerebral blood flow measurements, and clinical symptoms and signs were improved at the operation site in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because the STA and the superficial portion of the temporal muscle attached to the skin flap were preserved, the skin at the operation site was not depressed and no <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>alopecia</z:hpo> developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> is progressive, so repeated bypass surgery may be required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, non-anastomotic bypass surgery is better for the first operation because the STA is preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present procedure using temporal muscle, galea, and dura can be extended over a wider brain surface than the operative field, and is suitable for establishing collateral circulation in the frontal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Blood flow in the skin flap is maintained, so the cosmetic result is satisfactory </plain></SENT>
