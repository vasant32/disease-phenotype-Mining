<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed indirect cerebral revascularization by using omental flap and muscle flap techniques for the treatment of ischemic cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease including three with adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> underwent this procedure (omental flap on eight sides and muscle flap on five sides) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The muscle used for the flap was the serratus anterior muscle on two sides and shaved latissimus dorsi muscle on three sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography and cerebral blood flow studies were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients preoperatively and postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients demonstrated severely impaired cerebrovascular reserve capacity due to occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was one patient each with perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and intracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> following omental flap loss, and two patients had perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average follow-up period was 23.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the nine surviving patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight except for the one with flap loss had good outcome with complete resolution of neurologic episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that this method seems to be effective in selected patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
