<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ischemic symptoms in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi>) are usually due to hemodynamically mediated perfusion failure, and identification of abnormal tissue perfusion in these patients is therefore clinically important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI can be used to study tissue perfusion, there are potential technical problems in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigates the scope and limitations of perfusion MRI in the clinical evaluation of such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen patients with bilateral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> were studied with the use of structural, diffusion, and perfusion MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The DSC MRI data were analyzed both visually and by a quantitative regional analysis, and the relationship between perfusion status and clinical symptoms was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Extensive bilateral DSC MRI abnormalities were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a very <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> distribution of bolus arrival time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The areas of abnormality included the major arterial border zones in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, although these usually appeared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on structural and diffusion MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only the most clinically unstable patients had peak width (defined as time to peak minus bolus arrival time) &gt;5 seconds on the quantitative regional analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Several technical limitations of perfusion quantification in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> are described, as well as the implications of these limitations in patients with other forms of occlusive large-vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The technical limitations of DSC MRI described in this study are important for the accurate interpretation of perfusion MRI in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite these limitations, these preliminary findings suggest that the use of quantitative regional analysis of summary parameters may provide clinically useful information in patients with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
