<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its overwhelming effects on fibroblast and peripheral nerve growths were soon noticed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there was no direct evidence of production of any of the growth factors by the omentum, although substances were shown to be present in the omentum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three animals were used in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After removal of the omentum in one, the tissue was submitted to PCR for BDNF, NT3/4 and NT5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Water was the negative control utilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was marked expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> neurotrophins in the omentum, indicating local production of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> those substances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The omentum has, for the first time, demonstrated to produce and not only accumulate neurotrophins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Utilization of this concept may permit transplant or transposition of parts of the omentum into the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system for the management of multiple diseases, including vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moya-Moya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
