<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We introduced a simplified method of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-enhanced CT (SXe-CT) for obtaining the topographic regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) map </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the SXe-CT, we used the method of brief (three to four minutes) inhalation of 40% <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To shorten the period of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> inhalation, we substituted a predetermined brain-blood partition coefficient (L) in the entire brain for the directly estimated L to calculate the rCBF value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of its non-invasiveness and simplicity, the SXe-CT can be applied to the patients with diseases in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) without any difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the past three years, we performed the SXe-CT on 150 occasions in 100 subjects, including those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, other ischemic cerebrovascular diseases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this paper, the rCBF values of seven <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy adults with a mean age of 24 years are reported and the flow maps of some cases of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> diseases are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mean value of the hemispheres was 53, those of the gray matter were in the range of 38 to 72, those of the white matter were in the range of 26 to 35 and those of the basal ganglia and thalamus were 55 to 88 (values are given in ml/100 g/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The SXe-CT has potential advantages in obtaining clinically useful rCBF measurements </plain></SENT>
