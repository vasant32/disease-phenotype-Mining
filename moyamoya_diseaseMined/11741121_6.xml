<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction angiography demonstrated intracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels and a PPHA on the right side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was collateral blood flow from the posterior circulation to the anterior circulation, with the PPHA functioning as a blood supplier vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent multiple burr hole formation, and neovascularization via the burr holes was observed on follow-up angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this case, blood flow into the posterior circulation via the PPHA, which served as the collateral vessel to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011834'>moyamoya phenomenon</z:hpo>, may have disturbed the spontaneous closure of the PPHA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, this case serves as a basis for studying important pathogenic and embryological processes that contribute to the development of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
