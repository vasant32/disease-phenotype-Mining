<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report 12 new cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> in French, non-Asian adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> managed at a French University Hospital from 1998 through 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reviewed baseline clinical and radiological data and collected follow-up data between March and June 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was determined using the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients, 10 women and two men, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age at baseline was 31.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The initial clinical manifestation was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The disease was clinically asymptomatic in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up in the 10 symptomatic patients was 52.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only one patient was surgically treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The one and five-year risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were both 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At the end of the follow-up, one patient was dead, four patients had no functional impairment (grade 0-1 on the Rankin scale), and seven patients had moderate functional impairment (grade 2-3 on the Rankin scale) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> as identified by failure on the Trail Making Test part B was found in six of ten patients evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> in this cohort of French, non-Asian adults was associated with high rates of both recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> in non-Asian adults is a potentially severe disease </plain></SENT>
