<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Flow velocities were recorded using a miniaturized Doppler probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intravascular pressure changes in the draining veins before and after AVF removal was measured with small needles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Varying the pCO2 between 20 mm Hg and 60 mm Hg, the flow velocities in arteries supplying the spinal cord were investigated so that the vasomotoric reactivity of the peripheral vessel wall in cord tissue was investigated before and after AVF occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The flow velocities in dural AVF feeders were not as high as those known from cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> feeders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, they often showed lowered end-diastolic flow velocity as a sign of increased vascular resistance, thus proving impaired venous outflow from the spinal canal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After excision of the local <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>, the vessels supplying and draining the spinal cord showed improved circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the former recipient veins, no further flow could be recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The venous pressure in dural AVF was about 70% of the systemic arterial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>Fistulas</z:mpath> presenting a high shunt volume on angiography showed only moderately increased venous pressure and a more pronounced pressure drop after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> occlusion as compared with low-volume <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity of vessels supplying the spinal cord was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> before and after AFV removal </plain></SENT>
