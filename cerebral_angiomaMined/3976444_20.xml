<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 4 main methods of presentation: haemorrhage, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, deteriorating neurological signs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The fifth common method of presentation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, almost exclusively confined to infants, was not seen in the current series which includes no paediatric cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Standard techniques of investigation principly angiography and CT scanning were used in diagnosis and the current indication for surgery was haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate per haemorrhage in the series considered in natural terms was 3.6%, neurological deficit as a result of the haemorrhage, either major or minor, occurred in a total of 8%, 4% each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complete excision of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> was performed in 69 cases, although in 3 of these it was necessary to reoperate following postoperative angiography which was then used again to confirm total removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in this series of radical removals, a mortality rate of 1.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six cases however, showed significant neurological deterioration postoperatively, a major morbidity of 8.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From the period of observation of these cases and the instance of haemorrhage the annual <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> rate would appear to be 4.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From follow-up of our cases where the lesion was not completely removed the re-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> rate would appear to be 2.6% </plain></SENT>
