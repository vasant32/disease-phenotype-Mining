<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasounds, SEPs and EEG brain mapping by means of median nerve stimulation, were performed, followed by a NMR of the brain, which revealed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> in the left hemisphere (frontal and parietal lobe) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By comparing the results of the neurophysiological tests, the diagnostic value of TCD, confirmed by the neuroradiologic findings, was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EEG and SEPs were also abnormal, but their actual effectiveness in clinical studies is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that these electrophysiological examinations do not allow a reliable diagnosis as with TCD </plain></SENT>
