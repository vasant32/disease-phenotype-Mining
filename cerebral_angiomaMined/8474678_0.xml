<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Epidural anaesthesia can be a valid alternative to general anaesthesia as it provides excellent <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> allowing an accurate assessment of the neurological conditions of the mother and avoiding opioids and/or hypotensive drugs, potentially dangerous to the foetus, to blunt the hypertensive response to intubation </plain></SENT>
