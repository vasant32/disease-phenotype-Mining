<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Part II deals with the applicability of a controlled-viscosity fibrin mixture via different types of arterial catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a flow-dynamic model the embolizing medium injected via a double syringe was shown to block a blood flow corresponding approximately to the flow encountered in cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the course of animal experiments the embolization of mesenteric arteries of rabbits showed the distribution of the embolizing medium to be dependent on its viscosity; the action of an embolizing medium applied by means of a double syringe was studied in the femoral arteries of rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Scintigraphy was used to study the distribution of the substance in the body of the experimental animal after intravenous (i.v.) application; long-term studies of embolized auricular arteries in rabbits revealed parchment-like necroses after 5 to 10 days and the presence of radiopaque substances in the ear stumps after 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
