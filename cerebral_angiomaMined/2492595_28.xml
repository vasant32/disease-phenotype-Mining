<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Local hemodynamics were investigated during nine operations for spinal dural arteriovenous (AV) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In eight cases, microvascular Doppler sonography was used to measure flow velocities and vasomotor reactivity to <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intravascular pressure recordings of the draining veins on the medullary surface were performed in nine cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The flow velocities in dural AV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> feeding vessels were not as high as has been shown in cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> feeders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The AV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> feeders often showed low end-diastolic flow velocities as a sign of increased vascular resistance, even in the presence of a downstream AV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>, thus proving disturbance of venous outflow from the spinal canal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After excision of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>, the circulation of the spinal cord vessels improved, with higher inflow and outflow velocities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the veins formerly draining the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>, no further flow could be recorded; however, they did not collapse, indicating that some pressure remained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean venous pressure in the dural AV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> was about 74% of the systemic arterial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It increased concomitantly with the arterial pressure, which may explain the clinical deterioration that occurs during physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>Fistulas</z:mpath> with a high shunt volume on angiography showed only moderately increased venous pressures and a more pronounced pressure drop compared to low-volume <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity of vessels supplying the spinal cord could be demonstrated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, and was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> before and after removal of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
