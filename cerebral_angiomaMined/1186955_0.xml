<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An increase in blood flow in these arteries by 10 to 50% was observed in three-fourths of patients, while in one-fourth this flow decreased by 10--25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increased blood flow was observed mainly in <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angiomas</z:mp> situated in the area of vascularization of the middle cerebral artery, mainly in the sensori-motor area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Decreased blood flow was present usually in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> and in cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> situated in farther vascularization areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the operation the blood flow in corresponding arteries was nearly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in most cases </plain></SENT>
