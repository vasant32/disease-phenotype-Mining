<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral function has been examined clinically and from neurophysiologic, neuropsychologic and linguistic aspects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>History, pre-and postoperative clinical findings are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Post-operative motor-activity was registered continuously with 6 electromyograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is described, compared with a case of right sided hemispherectomy and discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the basis of a survey of the literature the cerebral activity before and after operation, examined with quantitative EEG analysis, is described and discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a general exposition of the linguistic ability of the right non-dominant hemisphere it is shown that this must have been a case of left dominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On this assumption the formal-quantitative linguistic findings after left-sided hemispherectomy are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The neuro-psychologic tests, pre- and post-operatively carried out with several techniques (LPS, HAWIE, FLT, Token-Test), are compared with each other and the results of further tests (a short form of the "Minnesota-test and our own collection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> tests) after hemispherectomy added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After a survey of relevant descriptions in the literature the postoperative linguistic findings (lexic and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, syntax, relationship between idea and expressive realization) are described and compared with similar findings in the literature </plain></SENT>
