This study examined the efficacy and tolerability of docetaxel(DOC)in combination with epirubicin(EPI)as the first-line treatment for patients with advanced and recurrent breast cancer. A total of 56 female patients with metastatic breast cancer not previously treated for metastatic disease received DOC(60mg/m²)and EPI(60mg/m2)on day 1 every 3 weeks. The patient characteristics included a median age of 53 years. Advanced disease was present in 86% of patients, and recurrent disease was found in 14%; 3 or more metastatic sites had been diagnosed in 38% of patients, and 59% patients were ER+. The median number of courses administered was 6. The median dose intensity was 18. 7mg/m²week for DOC and EPI, and the relative dose intensities were 93. 5%and 93. 3%, respectively. The clinical responses included a complete response in 5%, a partial response in 54%, and stable disease in 33% of patients, with a disease control rate of 92%. The progression-free survival was 78. 3%, and the overall survival was 91. 9% at 1 year. Grade 3/4 toxicities included neutropenia in 82%, leukopenia in 71%, febrile neutropenia in 16%, anorexia in 9%, and anemia in 7%of the patients. Neither congestive heart failure nor toxic death occurred. The D and E combination with doses of 60mg/m2 is an active and generally well-tolerated regimen that can be used as first-line chemotherapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer.
