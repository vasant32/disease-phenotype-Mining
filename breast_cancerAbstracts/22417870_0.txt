ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Estrogen Receptor- (ER) and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) positivity are inversely correlated by standard criteria. However, we investigated the quantitative relationship between ER and HER2 expression at both RNA and protein levels in HER2+ve and HER2-ve breast carcinomas. METHODS: ER and HER2 levels were assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and (for HER2) Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) and by q-RT-PCR in formalin-fixed primary breast cancers from 448 patients in the National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) Adjuvant Breast Cancer Trial (ABC) tamoxifen only arm. Relationships at the RNA level were assessed in 1139 TransATAC tumours. RESULTS: ER and HER2 RNA levels were negatively correlated as expected in HER2+ve (IHC 3+ and/or FISH-amplified) tumours (r=-0.45, P=0.0028). However in HER2-ve tumours (ER+ve and ER-ve combined), a significant positive correlation was found (r=0.43, P<0.0001), HER2 RNA levels being 1.74-fold higher in ER+ve vs. ER-ve tumours. This correlation was maintained in the ER+veHER2-ve subgroup (r=0.24, P=0.0023) and confirmed in this subgroup in 1139 TransATAC tumours (r=0.25, P<0.0001). The positive relationship extended to IHC-detected ER in ABC: mean+/-95%CI H-scores were 90+/-19 and 134+/-19 for 0 and 1+ HER2 IHC categories, respectively (P=0.0013). A trend towards lower RFS was observed in patients with the lowest levels of ER and HER2 RNA levels within the ER+veHER2-ve subgroup both for ABC and TransATAC cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: ER and HER2 expression is positively correlated in HER2ve tumours. The distinction between HER2+ve and HER2ve is greater in ERve than ER+ve tumours. These findings are important to consider in clinical trials of anti-HER2 and anti-endocrine therapy in HER2ve disease. Clinical trial identifier: ISRCTN31514446.
