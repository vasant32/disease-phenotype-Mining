The cases of 2 children with true aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAHs) and initial false-negative angiograms are reported. In both cases, the initial angiogram was of adequate technical quality and included the projections on which aneurysms were later documented. There was no significant vasospasm at the time of initial angiography; therefore, transient aneurysm sac thrombosis was the most likely explanation for the initial false-negative studies. It is particularly interesting to note that 1 of the 2 patients had a pattern of hemorrhage compatible with the most limited definition of a perimesencephalic SAH, that is, a small prepontine cistern hemorrhage. If a second angiogram had been deemed unnecessary based on that criterion alone, a ruptured basilar tip aneurysm would have escaped detection and treatment.
