Thrombotic occlusion of the middle cerebral artery's branch occurred just after embolization of a nonruptured cerebral aneurysm. Bail-out stent-assisted mechanical thrombectomy of the clot was performed. DSA revealed normal vessel patency at the end of the procedure. There were no adverse events related to this thrombectomy, and the patient recovered from the embolization with minor neurologic deficit. There was no neurologic deficit after 90 days follow-up.
