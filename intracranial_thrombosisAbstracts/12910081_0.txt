Most neurological complications of the Klippel-Tr√©naunay syndrome are due to the presence of cerebral or spinal arteriovenous malformations and their consequences. We report 2 cases of unusual complications of this syndrome. In the first case, where the anomalies were restricted to the left upper extremity, the occurrence of hand numbness led to the discovery of a carpal tunnel syndrome, probably due to the lymphatic abnormal proliferation within the carpal tunnel. In the second case the disease was much more widespread and affecting, among other localizations, the cephalic extremity. The patient presented with intractable left motor seizures that appeared to be due to an occlusion of the right transverse and sigmoid sinuses. Treatment with heparin and anticonvulsants led to rapid recovery.
