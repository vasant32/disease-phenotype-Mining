1. Effects of voluntary exercise on blood pressures, oxidative stress, urinary nitric oxide (NO) level and expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) mRNA were studied in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP/Izm). 2. SHRSP at the age of 6 weeks were divided into four groups: (i) the control group, sedentary group; (ii) the L-NAME group, which was the sedentary control group given L-NAME (5 mg/kg per day) in drinking water; (iii) the exercise group, which was allowed to run voluntarily on running wheel attached to the metal cages; and (iv) the exercise plus L-NAME group which was loaded exercise and given L-NAME solution for 3 weeks. 3. The bodyweight and systolic pressure of rats were increased with age and the bodyweight of the rats in an exercise plus L-NAME group was less than control but systolic pressure in the exercise group were significantly lower than control. 4. Thrombotic tendency assessed by He-Ne laser method in an exercise group was significantly decreased compared with the rest of the groups. 5. Urinary nitrite/nitrate level was significantly increased in the exercise group compared with before (6 weeks) and after exercise (9 weeks), but there were no significant differences in the rest of groups. 6. eNOS mRNA expression of aorta in the exercise group measured after exercise was significantly higher than the other groups. 7. Urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) level after exercise was significantly decreased in the exercise group compared with before exercise. 8. These results suggested that voluntary exercise decreased thrombotic tendency by increasing NO level through enhanced expression of eNOS mRNA and antioxidative effects.
