Ten cases of lacunar infarction, 10 cases of nonlacunar cerebral thrombosis, and 8 healthy controls who did not have risk factors of cerebrovascular diseases were studied. Subcortical cystic infarctions with a diameter of less than 1.5 cm were classified as lacunar infarction and the other cerebral thrombosis were classified as nonlacunar cerebral thrombosis. Cerebral blood flow examination by Xenon computed tomography (CT) method was performed within 14 days after the onset of stroke. Stable Xenon was inhaled for 3 minutes and CT scan was taken once before the inhalation, 3 times during the inhalation, and 5 times in the washout phase. Regional blood flows in the infarcted area, around the infarcted area, and in the cerebral cortex and the cerebral white matter where the influence of the infarction was considered to be little were measured before and after intravenous injection of 17 mg/kg acetazolamide. In the lacunar infarction, the blood flow in the cerebral cortex where the influence of the infarction was considered to be little was decreased and the cerebrovascular dilatory reserve capacity in the cerebral cortex and the cerebral white matter was decreased. Arteriolosclerosis is considered to be the basic cause of lacunar infarction.
