A cor triatriatum is a congenital malformation of the heart which, in almost all cases, is diagnosed in childhood, whereas adult cases are very rare. The hemodynamics of the cor triatriatum is similar to that of mitral stenosis, which sometimes, but rarely, causes embolism. We present a case of multiple cerebral infarctions accompanied with a cor triatriatum. A 57-year-old female suddenly displayed impaired consciousness and hemiparesis immediately after cranioplasty for another disease, and was diagnosed by a diffusion weighted MRI as having multiple infarctions. A transesophageal echocardiography detected a membrane-like, echo-dense structure across the left atrium, suggesting a cor triatriatum. We suspect that her multiple infarctions were caused by embolism due to a cor triatriatum. Here, we discuss the relationship between her embolic stroke and the cor triatriatum, with references to literature on the subject.
