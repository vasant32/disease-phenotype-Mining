 OBJECTIVE: The present work was undertaken to establish an animal model of basilar arterial thrombosis. METHOD: The bilateral carotid arterial of guinea pigs were ligated and 40% ferric chloride solution was applied to basilar artery topically. The blood flow of cochlea(CBF) was measured continuously with laser doppler flow-meter. The mean arterial pressure (MABP) was recorded simultaneously. The data was analysed by t-test. RESULT: After the administration of 40% FeCl3 to basilar artery, The CBF began decrease significantly from 5 to 10 min, and declined more great along with the prolongation of FeCl3 effect. The CBF reached to (64.5 +/- 4.2)% of the base level at 50 min after FeCl3 exposure. A total average decrease of CBF was (81.3 +/- 12.0)% of the base level throughout the experiment period. The MABP had no significant change. CONCLUSION: The topical application of 40% FeCl3 solution can offer an ideal model of basilar artery thrombosis.
