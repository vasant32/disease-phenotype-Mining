We present a case of primary antiphospholipid syndrome with acute renal failure and alveolar haemorrhage. He was successfully treated with cyclophosphamide, corticosteroids and plasma exchange. Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome may develop a broad spectrum of pulmonary disease. Pulmonary thromboembolism and pulmonary hypertension are the most common complications, but alveolar haemorrhage have also been reported. Other causes need to be excluded. Despite favourable outcome of many patients with association of plasma exchange, immunosuppressive drugs and anticoagulant therapy, definite conclusions about the best therapeutic regimen could not be draw.
