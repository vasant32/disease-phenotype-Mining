We present data concerning the extraction of clots using the newly invented "GP" mechanical thrombectomy device (MTD). Artificial and porcine clots of various lengths were used in plastic tube models of an artery. We investigate the pressures and times taken for clot extraction together with the volumes of fluid extracted. We also investigate the impact of using a funnel structure mounted on the end of the device, on clot removal times and fluid removed. Finally, we present results involving clot extraction from the posterior popliteal artery of a cadaver. Our data indicated that: The embedded GP MTD is the most effective device regarding artificial and porcine blood clot removal. This result is consistent with previous published data on this device. The GP MTD was effective in removing clots positioned in the posterior popliteal artery of a cadaver. The embedded GP device removes less fluid compared with the end-mounted GP device. This confirms previous studies. There appears to be a relationship between funnel angle and pressure. Lower extraction pressures are required for larger funnel angles mounted on the GP device. Shorter times of clot extraction are required for larger funnel angles.
