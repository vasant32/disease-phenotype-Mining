Cerebral venous thrombosis is an uncommon event which presents a wide spectrum of sometimes extraneurological signs different from the classical clinical presentation. We report the cases of two middle-aged women who developed thrombosis of the left lateral sinus spread-ing to the internal jugular vein from the sigmoid sinus. The time course of the symptoms suggested that intracranial thrombosis occurred first. No infectious or neoplastic local disease could be found but both women were taking oral contraceptives. Medical treatment led to good reperfusion of the intracranial sinuses but occlusion of the jugular vein persisted despite prolonged oral anticoagulants. Long-term outcome was favorable with residual benign epilepsy in one patient, and occurrence of an arteriovenous fistula in the other.
