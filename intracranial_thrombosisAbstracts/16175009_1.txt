The factor II G20210A mutation and estrogen treatment are described as risk factors for cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). We evaluated these known risk factors in a population of CVT patients and investigated the role of a combination of two polymorphisms in the promoter of the protein C gene (PC promoter CG haplotype), newly described as risk factors for deep venous thrombosis. A retrospective population of 26 CVT patients was compared with a control group of 84 healthy volunteers. After a multivariate analysis, we confirmed that the factor II G20210A mutation is an independent risk factor for CVT with odds ratio 4.7 (95% confidence interval, 2.83--75.3). We demonstrated that the CVT risk is increased when this mutation is associated either with the PC promoter CG haplotype (odds ratio=19.8; 95% confidence interval, 2.1--186.5) or, in females, with an estrogen treatment (odds ratio=24; 95% confidence interval, 2.26--127.3). In this work, the association of the factor II G20210A mutation and the PC promoter CG haplotype or estrogen treatment seems to be a particular risk for CVT.
