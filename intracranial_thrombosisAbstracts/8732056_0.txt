Salvia miltiorrhiza and polysaccharide sulphate are commonly prescribed for curing cerebral vascular diseases. In this study, we found that the adhesion of erythrocytes of the patients with cerebral thrombosis to cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells was decreased in number and intensity after the erythrocytes were treated with salvia miltiorrhiza and polysaccharide sulphate in flow field. Moreover we found that polysaccharide sulphate was more effective than salvia miltiorrhiza in preventing adherence in common doses. The two drugs' effects of preventing adherence might be an important mechanism for curing the patients with cerebral thrombosis.
