An increased incidence of cerebral thromboembolic events has been reported in young patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It has been suggested that a hypercoagulable state is associated with clinical activity of the disease, with elevation of factors V, VIII, fibrinogen and platelets and a lowering of anti-thrombin III. We present the case of a 35 y/o male with refractory Crohn's disease who complained of headaches, blurred vision and tonic-clonic seizures. The studies demonstrated an ischemic stroke of the left cerebral hemisphere, without vascular abnormalities. Elevation of factor VIII, platelets, and antithrombin III were found. The symptoms were relieved with medical treatment and the patient has continued in good health after resection of the diseased terminal ileum.
