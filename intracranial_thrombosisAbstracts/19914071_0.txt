Spontaneous spinal epidural haematoma (SSEH) is a rare cause of spinal cord compression in adults, especially in the elderly. We report an independent 88-year-old female, on aspirin only for chronic atrial fibrillation, who presented with a 12-hour history of acute lumbar back pain, urinary incontinence and progressive bilateral lower limb paresis. Examination revealed saddle anaesthesia and reduced anal tone. Urgent spinal MRI demonstrated an epidural haematoma extending from T7 to L5. The patient made a poor initial post-operative recovery, but four months later had begun to mobilise independently after intensive physiotherapy. The case highlights the significance of clinical suspicion, especially in those patients on anti-platelet therapy, rapid spinal radiography and emergent decompressive surgery in SSEH patients, as well as the importance of ongoing rehabilitation in restoring neurological function.
