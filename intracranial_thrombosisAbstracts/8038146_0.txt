Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is a newly-defined clinical entity of arterial thrombosis, venous thrombotic events, recurrent spontaneous abortion and thrombocytopenia in the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. We have experienced a 23-year-old male SLE patient with positive anticardiolipin antibody who presented with left hemiparesis and paresthesia. The clinical and laboratory findings were compatible with the criteria for SLE and he was found to have anticardiolipin antibody, thrombocytopenia, prolonged partial thromboplastin time and cerebral thrombosis. Initially, he was treated with high dose steroid and warfarin and now he is being followed up with warfarin and steroid.
