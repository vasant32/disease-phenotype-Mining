Leading place among all postoperative complications are occupied by thrombosis and embolism as the cause of mortality in elderly and senile patients. Application of existing anticoagulants of direct (heparin) and indirect (fenilin, neodicumarin, sincumar) action is not always effective. If is necessary to introduce in clinical practice the medicinal preparations, which possess more effective and selective antithrombotic activity. To these requests corresponds lower molecular heparin fraxiparin (nadroparin calcium). For the thrombosis and embolism prophylaxis fraxiparin was used in 0.3 ml dose once a day subcutaneously during 3-5 days after operation. Investigation of the blood coagulation system before and after application of fraxiparin trusted the hemostasis normalization comparing with initial tenseness of the coagulation system. Comparative estimation of the normalization degree of the homeostasis system in patients with high risk of the thrombi formation under the influence of heparin and fraxiparin high efficacy of lower molecular heparin, fraxiparin, was established. So far as fraxiparin practically do not influence the homeostasis system negatively, it is necessary to consider him the preparation of choice in patients with an acute surgical illness and to use in the clinic of urgent surgery. The way of fraxiparin injection performance, the lack of necessity in frequent control of the blood coagulating and anticoagulation systems allow to apply the preparation in surgical clinics of various ranking and rigging.
