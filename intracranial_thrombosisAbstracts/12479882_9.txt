It is widely recognized that thrombosis is the major event in the evolution of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and acute ischemic stroke (AIS). But the contribution of coagulation factors to the development of ischemic arterial diseases is still not clearly established. The goal of this study was to establish the possible relationship between coagulation factors as well as anticoagulant and the onset of AMI and AIS. The study population consisted of 69 patients with AMI and 71 with AIS as well as 50 age-matched healthy volunteers. Compared with the control group, plasma tissue factor (TF) and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) activities and both TF and TFPI antigens were significantly higher in the AMI group; plasma TF activity and antigen in AIS group were significantly increased, but the activity and antigen of plasma TFPI were significantly decreased in the AIS group. Plasma FVII coagulation (FVII:C) activity was markedly higher in patients with AIS, but not statistically different to the control in patients with AMI. FVIII coagulation (FVIII:C) activity was remarkably higher in patients with AMI but slightly lower than the control in patients with AIS. In the AMI and AIS groups, prothrombin activity and clottable fibrinogen were significantly higher and plasma antithrombin III activity was remarkably lower than the control. The results suggested that during the onset of AMI and AIS, the initiation of TF pathway would be associated with the thrombotic events and that the blood be in hypercoagulable state. But the changes of FVII:C, TFPI and FVIII:C in AMI are different from those in AIS.
