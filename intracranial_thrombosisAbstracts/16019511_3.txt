We described the cerebral thrombotic complications developed in 2 adolescent patients treated with L-asparaginase-containing regimens. For determining risk factors, we retrospectively analysed hemostatic markers in 19 pediatric patients with leukemia or lymphoma who were treated with either 1 of the 2 L-asparaginase-containing regimens; 11 were treated with VLP1 and the remaining 8 were treated with the VLAD protocol. The data indicated that low coagulation factors in association with increased plasma D-dimer levels during or post-L-asparaginase administration combined with fresh frozen plasma infusion might have activated coagulation processes in these patients. Careful management is required to prevent such episodes in patients with markedly decreased coagulation factors and increased D-dimer levels following L-asparaginase administration.
