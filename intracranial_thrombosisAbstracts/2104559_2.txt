A 33 year old woman with severe thrombocytopenic purpura complicated by typical lupus anticoagulant developed repeated spontaneous abortion, deep venous thrombosis, and cerebral thrombosis. The platelet count fluctuated from 4,000 to 400,000/mm3 during the 13 year clinical course. The physical and laboratory findings at the time of severe thrombocytopenic purpura were compatible with the criteria of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura except for positive lupus anticoagulant. Both immunosuppressive therapy with prednisolone and antithrombotic therapy with warfarin and aspirin were necessary for the control of bleeding and venous and arterial thrombosis.
