Controversy exists regarding the influence of mitral regurgitation (MR) on thromboembolic risk in patients with atrial fibrillation. We aimed to investigate retrospectively a reduction of risk for stroke due to MR in atrial fibrillation and to evaluate the effectiveness of low-intensity anticoagulation therapy. In 313 patients with atrial fibrillation, transthoracic echocardiography was performed and MR was graded. Between the groups with no or mild MR (n = 209) and with moderate or severe MR (n = 104), age, sex, treatment, history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipemia and mitral stenosis, and previous stroke were compared. No significant differences in clinical characteristics, treatment, or history were observed between the two groups. The incidence of thromboembolism was significantly higher in the group with no MR (48 patients [23%]) than in the group with MR (14 patients [13%], p < 0.05). In the MR group, previous stroke was frequently observed in patients without warfarin treatment (11 of 51 patients) compared with patients with low-dose warfarin treatment (international normalized ratio of 1.6-1.8) (3 of 53 patients, p < 0.05). Consequently, the thromboembolic event was markedly prevented by low-dose warfarin treatment.
