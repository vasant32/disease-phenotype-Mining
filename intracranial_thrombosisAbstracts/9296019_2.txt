Mesenteric ischemic process can lead to bowel infarction or indolent low-grade ischemia. Inherited thrombophilia represents about 30 to 40% of mesenteric vein thrombosis. Analysis of thromboembolism sites occurring during genetic defect of coagulant factors showed that mesenteric thrombosis is the third localization after lung and legs, in equal incidence with cerebral thrombosis. The genetic defects known to be associated with thrombophilia, as deficiencies of protein C, protein S, antithrombin III, and dysfibrinogenemia, are discussed. A special interest is devoted to resistance to activated protein C. Acquired diseases, as myeloproliferative disease or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinemia, inducing thrombosis are also discussed. Recent advances in both basic and clinical research have provided new insights that may be integrated into diagnostic and therapeutic practices.
