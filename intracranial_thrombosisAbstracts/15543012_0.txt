A 45-day-old boy presented with drowsiness, pallor, and respiratory failure of about 24 hours' duration. Initially, the family gave no history of trauma, but after the laboratory investigations, they admitted that he had fallen off a hammock. On the plain films and cranial computed tomography (CT), no fracture of the cranium was detected, but cranial CT and magnetic resonance imaging revealed thrombosis in the sigmoid sinus, superior sagittal sinus, and straight sinus; right subdural hematoma; diffuse cerebral edema; and diffuse infarction in the right posterior temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. Full recovery was achieved by anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin within 14 days. Falling off a hammock was the only risk factor for this patient. Thus, when cerebral thrombosis develops in childhood, trauma should be considered regardless of whether such information is provided by the family.
