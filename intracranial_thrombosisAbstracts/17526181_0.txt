OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of scalp-acupuncture drawing method (SADM) on recovering motor function in hemiplegic patients following cerebral thrombosis at convalescent period. METHODS: Adopting randomized, single-blinded, controlled method, 93 patients suffering from hemiplegia following cerebral thrombosis were randomly assigned to 3 groups, 31 in each group. All patients were treated based on neurological routine therapy, those in the treated group and the control group I were treated respectively with SADM and scalp-acupuncture twirling method (SATM) additionally, but for those in the control group II, no additional treatment was given. The treatment course for all was 4 weeks. RESULTS: Before treatment, there were insignificant difference among 3 groups in the score of neural motor function deficits (NFDS) of limbs and activity of daily life (ADL) score (P > 0.05). After being treated for 4 weeks, the NFDS was significantly lower and in the control group II (P < 0.01, P < 0.05) and the change of the scores in the treated group was more than that in the control group I (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: SADM was superior to scalp-acupuncture twisting prove the ADL score and motor function of hemiplegia patients following cerebral thrombosis in the convalescent stage.
