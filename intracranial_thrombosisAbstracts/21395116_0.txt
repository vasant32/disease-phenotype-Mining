Perifocal ischemia zone ultrastructural changes caused by unilateral photoinduced thrombosis of the rat prefrontal brain and reciprocal changes in an opposite hemisphere of a brain in 1 and 24 hours after an ischemia are investigated. Reactive changes of microcirculation, astrocytes, neurons in the perifocal zone of the ischemia, and also in the contralateral site of the intact hemisphere as increase in hematoencephalic barrier permeability, numbers of degraded neurons, astrocyte transport injury and glucose metabolic imbalance are revealed. The degree of reactive changes of neurons and glia in the contralateral hemisphere is less expressed, than in a right hemisphere and has other temporal dynamics.
