Two patients affected with a multiple sclerosis developed cerebral venous thrombosis after lumbar puncture and treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone. In one case, the course was favorable. The second patient died in spite of intracerebral thrombolysis. The autopsy confirmed the diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis and multiple sclerosis. We discuss the relationship between lumbar puncture, steroid treatment and cerebral venous thrombosis.
