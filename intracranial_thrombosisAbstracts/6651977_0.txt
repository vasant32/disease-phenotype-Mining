Calcification of ligamenta flava in the cervical spine is rarely seen. Only few cases in the literature have been available. Recently we have had experience with two cases on that lesion who had progressive radiculomyelopathy. The purpose of this report is not only case presentation but also an analysis of 11 cases from the literature in clinical, radiological and histological aspects. Case 1 was a 60-year-old woman who had numbness in both hands, mild weakness of the right foot on walking and clumsiness of the right hand. Ten years before she had suffered tbc. meningitis, but no history of neck injury. Neurological examination revealed spastic paresis in right extremities, muscle atrophy in both forearms, hypesthesia and hypalgesia in both hands and feet. Vibration sense was disturbed below the knee joint and both feet. Sphincter function was normal. Radiological examination of cervical spine revealed oval calcified nodules in the posterior spinal canal at the level of C34, C45, C56 and C67. These were all situated in the paramedian portion and symmetrically situated at C56. Air myelogram demonstrated that the spinal cord was displaced forward and choked by the posterior situated calcification. Cervical laminectomy was carried out from C2 through Th1 and calcified nodules in the hypertrophied ligamenta flava were successfully removed. Case 2 was also 66-year-old woman who had been suffering from cerebral thrombosis with left hemiparesis. In addition with left hemiparesis she started to complain with paresthesia in right hand, deteriorated numbness in left extremities and gait disturbance developed a year later.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
