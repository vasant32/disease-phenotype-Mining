By summing up a series of epidemiological evidence a continuous elevation of total serum cholesterol, especially LDL-cholesterol, leads atherosclerosis and causes the narrowing or occlusion of coronary artery which introduces acute myocardial infarction or angina pectoris in the heart. In the brain, it is a risk factor for cerebral thrombosis. On the other hand, a lower level, 160 mg/dl or less of total serum cholesterol relates with the higher incidence of cerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage, but still with the lower incidence of ischemic heart disease. It is concluded that the higher the total serum cholesterol level and the longer the period of continuous elevation is, the higher the incidence of ischemic heart disease. And there is a U-shape relationship between the level of serum cholesterol and cerebrovascular disease as a whole with a nadir around 160 to 200 mg/dl which means an optimal range of total serum cholesterol. A subject with total serum cholesterol over the optimal level may need some sort of modification in his daily life, in eating or physical exercise but not necessarily requires any pharmacological therapy.
