PURPOSE: To describe parenchymal perianeurysmal cystic changes in the brain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among 247 patients with cerebral aneurysms described in the medical or radiologic records in three institutions, five had perianeurysmal cystic changes. These were evaluated with computed tomography or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and were categorized according to size, appearance, and the presence of hemosiderin deposit. Confirmation at stereotactic needle biopsy was available in one case. RESULTS: Perianeurysmal cysts comprised multiple clustered cysts in three cases and a unilocular cyst in two, and diameters were 1.5-3.5 cm. Hemosiderin was depicted at MR imaging in one unilocular cyst. Associated aneurysms had diameters of 0.7-4.0 cm, and prominent aneurysmal thrombosis and calcifications were seen in two cases. Findings at stereotactic needle biopsy were of mild reactive gliosis. At long-term follow-up in two patients, the cystic regions were stable. CONCLUSION: Parenchymal perianeurysmal cysts are rare and may display various morphologic characteristics from unilocular to multilocular. Since there may or may not be evidence of previous hemorrhage, other mechanisms such as abnormal angiogenesis factors may play a role.
