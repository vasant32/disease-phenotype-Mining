Hypercholesterolemia was also found in case of the deceased myocardial infarction. The most important risk factor for cerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage was hypertension. Serum cholesterol in the deceased subjects with cerebral hemorrhage and cerebral thrombosis was elevated 10% during the last decade of the study whereas in myocardial infarction it remained unchanged.
