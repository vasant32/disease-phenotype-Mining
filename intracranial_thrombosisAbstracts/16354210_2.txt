BACKGROUND: The prognosis of Japanese patients with congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS) and Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS) is not clear. METHODS: Five patients with CNS and four patients with DDS, which causes secondary CNS, were studied retrospectively. RESULTS: Seven patients were sporadic and two DDS patients were identical twins. Five CNS patients presented with edema within 3 months of birth. In four DDS patients, edema was not noted and end-stage renal disease developed between 7 months and 6 years of age. Of these five CNS patients, one patient had cerebral thrombosis and cytomegalovirus pneumonia at the onset and another patient died during dialysis. Frequent intravenous albumin administration required, growth and development during infancy were varied. Of the nine patients with CNS and DDS, seven received renal transplantation and were alive with functioning grafts at the last follow up. Catch-up growth was observed in five patients after transplantation. Five school-aged patients attended school and received adequate grades and two adults worked full-time. Of the DDS patients, dysuria due to hypospadias persisted in one patient and treatment for hypogonadism was needed in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: CNS and DDS were diagnosed early after onset and adequate treatment was started. Growth and development after renal transplantation were relatively good. Thrombotic episodes or severe infection in CNS patients was difficult to manage and complications resulting from DDS affected the quality of life.
