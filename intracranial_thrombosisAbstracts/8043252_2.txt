Intracranial thrombosis is a rare complication of oral contraceptive use. A case is presented of a 35-yr-old woman with multiple sclerosis who took oral contraceptives and, subsequently, experienced intracranial transverse and sigmoid sinus thromboses and, later, deep venous thrombosis of the calf. A review of the relationship between oral contraceptives and venous thrombosis is presented. In addition, the diagnostic work-up and treatment options for intracranial venous thrombosis are discussed, and appropriate birth control alternatives for disabled patients, that is, diaphragm, sponges, condoms and levonorgestrel, are reviewed.
