 BACKGROUND: Regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) plays an important role in the inflammatory process. This study is aimed at evaluating the potential association of the -403G/A (rs2107538) and -28C/G (rs2280788) polymorphisms of the RANTES gene promoter with the risk of atherothrombotic cerebral infarction (ACI) in Northern Han Chinese. METHOD: A total of 314 patients with ACI and 389 unrelated aged-matched healthy controls were recruited. Their genotypes of the RANTES gene promoter -403G/A (rs2107538) and -28C/G (rs2280788) were analyzed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (multiplex PCR) and multiplex SNaPshot analysis. The potential association of genotyping and allele frequencies with ACI in this population was assessed statistically. RESULTS: The frequencies of -403AA genotype and A allele in ACI male patients were significantly higher than that in healthy controls (P=0.007, P=0.009, respectively). Female patients were not different. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the -403AA genotype in males was significantly associated with an increased risk of ACI, even after adjusting for confounding factors (OR=4.344; 95% CI=1.969-9.582; P<0.001). Although there was no significant association of the -28C/G polymorphism with ACI, the A-(403)C-(28) haplotype was significantly associated with an increased risk of ACI in Han Chinese [OR=1.56, 95% CI=1.23-1.98, P<0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the -403AA genotype and A allele of the RANTES promoter were associated with increased risk for the development of ACI in male Northern Han Chinese.
