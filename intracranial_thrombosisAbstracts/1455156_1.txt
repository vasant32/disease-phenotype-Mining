We examined the effect of white blood cells (WBCs) on the red blood cell (RBC)-filterability, and the influence of plasma components on their interaction of their microcirculatory behaviour in cerebral thrombosis patients. Subjects studied were 20 patients with a history of cerebral thrombosis (60 +/- 4.7 years old) (mean +/- SD) and 28 healthy controls (59 +/- 5.4 years old). Filterability indices of RBC suspension (RFI) and suspension with RBCs plus WBCs (RWFI) were measured by the method of Nuclepore filtration. The values of RFI in patients and controls were 0.44 +/- 0.12 and 0.56 +/- 0.16 ml min-1 (mean +/- SD), and RWFIs were 0.33 +/- 0.092 and 0.40 +/- 0.11 ml min-1, respectively. The differences in both of these values between patients and controls were significant (p < or = 0.01 for RFI and p < or = 0.05 for RWFI, based on Student's t test, respectively). Both RFI and RWFI in bed-ridden patients were lower than those in the more active counterparts (p < or = 0.05, based on Student's t test). In patients, RFI and RWFI correlated positively with serum albumin (r = +0.515, p < 0.05; r = +0.533, p < 0.05, based on Student's t test, respectively). The net lowering effect of WBCs on RFI (RFI-RWFI) correlated positively with serum LDL-cholesterol in patients (r = +0.574, p < 0.01, based on Student's t test). WBCs play a significant role in reducing RFI, and its effect is related to the pathemas of patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
