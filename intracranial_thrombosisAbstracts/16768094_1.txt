A 39 year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of severe headache with fever continuing over two weeks. Three days after admission he developed aphasia and right hemiparesis, when his CT revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage at the left sylvian fissure. He was diagnosed as suffering from cerebral venous thrombosis because empty delta sign was positive on the enhanced brain CT. Suprasagittal sinus and bilateral transverse sinuses were not detected on the cerebral angiography. He was also diagnosed as having Graves' disease for the first time on the basis of free T3 13.56 pg/ml, free T4 4.65 ng/dl, TSH < 0.01 IU/ml, anti-TSH receptor antibody 4.3 IU/l, and thyroid stimulating antibody 224%. On the examination, homocystine and activities of antithrombin III, protein C, and protein S were normal. Antinculear, anti-DNA, anti-Sm, anticardiolipin beta2GP-I antibodies, and PR3ANCA were negative. Factor VIII activity, however, markedly increased over 300%, which has been known to increase in the cases of hyperthyroidism. He recovered well after the treatment with thiamazole in addition to warfarin followed by intravenous heparin. There are only six cases of cerebral venous thrombosis due to hyperthyroidism with increased factor VIII level. All of those cases were female, and 5 of them were taking oral contraceptives. This is a first Japanese male case.
