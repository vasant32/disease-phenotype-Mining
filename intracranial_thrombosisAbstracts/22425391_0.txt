Anticoagulation of cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT) is recommended in adults and has been also approved in the paediatric setting. Some controversies remain however between the existing paediatric professional consensus, notably about its use in children with intra-cranial haemorrhage and in neonates. The publication of further original studies prompted the French Society for Paediatric Neurology (SFNP) in association with a panel of EPNS experts, to update the level of evidence and the knowledge in this domain. A bibliographic analysis revealed that anticoagulants are widely used in paediatrics. Anticoagulation is well tolerated by children (Class I, level of evidence B) and also probably by neonates (Class IIa, level of evidence B). During the acute phase, anticoagulation is probably effective in reducing the risk of death and sequelae in children (Class IIa, level of evidence B). It is not yet possible to draw any conclusions regarding neonates (Class IIb). Anticoagulation is also effective in reducing the risk of recurrence (Class I, level of evidence B). This risk is dependent on several individual factors such as the age of the child, the cause of the thrombosis, the persistence or the recurrence of thrombogenic factors, and the speed of sinus recanalisation. The duration of anticoagulation needs therefore to be individually tailored (Class I, level of evidence B). These observations have led to the following recommendations: -In the absence of any contraindication, it is reasonable to initiate anticoagulation during the acute phase of CSVT in children. Prolonged treatment over 3-6 months is justified according to individual factors. -In the absence of any contraindication, anticoagulation may be considered individually during the acute phase of CSVT in neonates for a duration of 6-12 weeks.
