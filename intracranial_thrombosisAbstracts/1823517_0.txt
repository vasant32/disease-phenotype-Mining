A 13-year-old boy was admitted to this hospital for evaluation of pitting edema of both legs. Three years ago, he had been diagnosed to have nephrotic syndrome. Two and half years ago, because of persistent heavy proteinuria, poor response to steroids and frequent relapse of disease, a renal biopsy was done; characteristics of IgM nephropathy was shown. About a year previously, the patient felt dizziness and weakness of the left side of his body upon awakening one morning. Neurologic examination showed loss of muscle tone, muscle power and deep tendon reflexes. Sensory and cranial nerve function were intact. Blood pressure was normal. The CT scan of brain showed a patch of low attenuation area in the right temporal region, obliteration of the right cortical sulci and mild compression of right lateral ventricle. A diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome with right cerebral infarction was made. The patient's condition became stable two days later after mannitol infusion, correction of electrolytes, and supportive therapy. According to literature, most cases of nephrotic syndrome complicate with renal thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, and deep vein thrombosis. Few cases complicate with cerebral thrombosis and infarction. If patient have low plasma albumin and anti-thrombin III level, hyperfunction of platelet aggregability and use long-term diuretic therapy, they may be at higher risk of thromboembolic complications. If thromboembolic complications exist, anticoagulation treatment should be instituted. Prophylactic therapy with aspirin or dicumarol is not currently recommended.
