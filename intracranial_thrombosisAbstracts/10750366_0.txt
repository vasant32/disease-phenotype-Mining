Cerebral blood flow changes by argatroban in the acute stage of cerebral thrombosis have been investigated with the use of stable xenon computed tomography (Xe/CT). The study group consisted of 14 cases (7 males, 7 females) with the average age of 59 years old (ranging from 21 to 79 years of age). We evaluated the cerebral blood flow change after an intravenous drip infusion of 10 mg of argatroban. After the administration of argatroban, we recognized a significant increase in the blood flow (24.4 +/- 5.0 ml/100 g/min to 28.4 +/- 2.7 ml/100 g/min, p < 0.05) in the blood flow area of lower than 30 ml/100 g/min in the affected vascular territory. As a conclusion, we found that argatroban improves ischemic symptoms through the amelioration of blood flow in the penumbra area.
