Anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) is considered to be one of the contributory factors in the development of cerebral infarction. We compared the recurrence and prognosis of 20 ischemic stroke patients with positive IgG aCL who had no collagen vascular diseases with those in 120 patients with negative IgG aCL. The aCL-positive patients comprised 18 females and 2 males aged 43-79 (mean 64) years and the mean follow-up period was 5.6 years. The aCL-negative patients comprised 82 males and 38 females aged 40-84 (mean 64.2) years and the mean follow-up period was 5.8 years. There was no significant difference in age and mean follow-up period between the two groups. We examined the recurrence rate and the intervals from the onset to the recurrence in both groups. We investigated the relationship between the recurrence of stroke and chronological changes in titer of aCL in patients with positive aCL. We also evaluated the effectiveness of antiplatelet agents for the prevention of recurrent stroke in both groups. A positive aCL level was defined as one which was > 3 standard deviations (S.D.) above the mean level for normal controls. A high titer of aCL was defined as being > 7 S.D. above the normal mean value. Among the 20 patients with positive aCL, recurrence of ischemic stroke occurred in 10 (50%) (cerebral thrombosis in 8 and cerebral embolism in 2) and myocardial infarction developed in 2 patients. As regards the number of ischemic episodes of stroke, recurrence occurred twice in 4 and once in 6 patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
