The authors detail a rare case of basilar artery thrombosis in a patient with traumatic cervical spine facet dislocation. Although the patient's deficits could initially be explained by the spinal injury, deterioration to a "locked-in-state" could not. In addition to vertebral artery injuries, the basilar artery can also be indirectly involved in cases of cervical spine trauma. In the rare viable patient, immediate reduction of cervical spine dislocation may allow endovascular thrombolysis, if not otherwise contraindicated.
