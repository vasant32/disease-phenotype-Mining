BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this clinical evaluation was to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Penumbra System in the revascularization of patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke secondary to intracranial large vessel occlusive disease. METHODS: In this prospective, multicenter, single-arm study, 125 patients with neurological deficits as defined by a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score > or =8, presented within 8 hours of symptom onset, and an angiographic occlusion (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] Grade 0 or 1) of a treatable large intracranial vessel were enrolled. Patients who presented within 3 hours from symptom onset had to be ineligible or refractory to recombinant tissue plasminogen activator therapy. All patients were followed clinically for 90 days postprocedure. RESULTS: A total of 125 target vessels in 125 patients were treated by the Penumbra System. Postprocedure, 81.6% of the treated vessels were successfully revascularized to TIMI 2 to 3. There were 18 procedural events reported in 16 patients (12.8%), 3 patients (2.4%) had events that were considered serious. A total of 35 patients (28%) were found to have intracranial hemorrhage on 24-hour CT of which 14 (11.2%) were symptomatic. All cause mortality was 32.8% at 90 days with 25% of the patients achieving a modified Rankin Scale score of < or =2. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the Penumbra System allows safe and effective revascularization in patients experiencing ischemic stroke secondary to large vessel occlusive disease who present within 8 hours from symptom onset.
