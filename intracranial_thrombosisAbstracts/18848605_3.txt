The variability in the behavioral outcome of human and nonhuman animals after stroke raises the question whether the way that a stroke occurs is a contributing factor. Photothrombotic stroke in rats has been reported to produce especially variable results, with some animals showing either slight to no impairment to other animals displaying severe impairments. The present study investigated this variability. Rats received three different-sized photothrombotic treatments and were contrasted to rats receiving a "standard" motor cortex stroke produced by pial stripping. Rats were assessed acutely and chronically on a skilled reaching for food task using end-point measures and movement assessment in a constraint-induced rehabilitation paradigm. The results indicated that as the size of the photothrombotic infarct approached the size of the pial strip infarct so did chronic behavioral deficits. Nevertheless there were differences in the time course of recovery. Rats with photothrombotic lesions of all sizes were less impaired in the acute period of recovery both on measures of learned nonuse and constrained-induced recovery. The findings are discussed in relation to the idea that whereas the course of recovery might be altered as a function of the type of stroke, chronic deficits are more closely related to the ensuing damage.
