Isolated intracranial hypertension is a common manifestation of intracranial sino-venous thrombosis (ISVT). Markedly elevated intracranial tension presents with unusual features including cranial neuropathies and radiculopathy. We report two cases with ISVT, which presented with headache, papilledema, progressive visual loss, complete ophthalmoplegia and flaccid areflexic quadriparesis along with a normal sensorium. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and cervical spinal cord showed no lesions that could account for the neurological deficits. Markedly elevated lumbar CSF pressure was noted in both cases. Nerve conduction study favored radiculopathy in one case and was normal in the other. Raised intracranial pressure was found to be the sole cause for the clinical manifestations. Visual impairment persisted in one patient despite lumbo-peritoneal shunting while the other died of septicemia. To our knowledge there are no previous reports of a syndrome comprising blindness, ophthalmoplegia and flaccid quadriplegia due to intracranial hypertension in ISVT.
