To clarify the clinical importance of tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA) on the thrombosis, it is essential to be measured t-PA level in human plasma. Taking advantage of strong affinity of t-PA to fibrin, t-PA was isolated with Fibrin/Celite column chromatography. Immunological activities of t-PA of plasma samples determined by ELISA and the elution pattern of it on Fibrin/Celite column chromatography were studied. The results are as follows: The t-PA in human plasma was consisted of fibrin adsorbable t-PA and fibrin nonadsorbable t-PA. Both types of t-PA could be measured separately by using of Fibrin/Celite column chromatography. The fibrin adsorbable t-PA fraction showed two types of molecular size (major peak was Mr congruent to 70,000, minor peak was Mr congruent to 100,000) on Sephadex G-200 chromatography. The level of t-PA in plasma samples taken from 20 healthy subjects at rest was 2.4 +/- 1. 9 ng/ml, and concentration of t-PA increased to 10.4 +/- 3.2 ng/ml after venous stasis. But the t-PA level of plasma samples from patients with cerebral thrombosis did not increase after venous stasis. The changes of immunologically determined t-PA in plasma samples induced by venous stasis were not reflected in the fibrinolytic activities of the euglobulin fractions, but well reflected in the fibrinolytic activities of the elution fractions on Fibrin/Celite column chromatography. The level of fibrin nonadsorbable t-PA did not change by venous stasis, but the level of fibrin adsorbable t-PA increased from 5.1 +/- 1.9 ng/ml to 9.7 +/- 2.7 ng/ml in the case of 6 healthy subjects. It is concluded that, the plasma t-PA increased by venous stasis was the fibrin adsorbable t-PA, and it may play a very important role in physiological fibrinolysis.
