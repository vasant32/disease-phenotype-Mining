Congenital vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor deficiency is a very rare bleeding disorder, which usually presents with episodes of intracerebral bleed in the first few weeks of life, sometimes leading to a fatal outcome. We report a case of combined factor deficiency of vitamin K-dependent factors in which the patient presented with both intracerebral bleeding, and possibly also thrombosis, and responded to a vitamin K supplement along with fresh frozen plasma.
