Two patients with homozygous beta thalassaemia complicated by cerebral thrombosis are reported. An alteration in coagulability due to a sudden increase in haematocrit and platelets was the probable cause in one patient. Although the other patient had many complications of thalassaemia, the cause for cerebral thrombosis was not identifiable.
