OBJECTIVES: In this study the frequency of inherited thrombophilic risk factors in a population of German CVT patients and their influence on clinical outcome were evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients (age 37.1 +/- 16.3 years) with CVT were screened for inherited coagulation disorders. All participants received a full clinical follow-up (mean follow-up period 4.8 +/- 6.4 years). RESULTS: Inherited thrombophilic risk factors were identified in 9 (36%) of the 25 patients studied. Four were found positive for the heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation, 2 were heterozygous carriers of the prothrombin-G20210A-polymorphism. APC resistance proved to be a reliable screening method for factor V Leiden mutation, whereas genetic evaluation for protein S and C deficiencies failed to demonstrate any mutations despite the identification of 1 patient with a protein C and protein S deficiency each. One patient suffered from a familial plasminogen deficiency. These 9 patients had a less favorable outcome (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that screening for inherited thrombophilia should be an integral part in the diagnostic work up of CVT patients. Patients with inherited coagulopathies tended to have a less favorable outcome, corroborating recommendations for a longer period of oral anticoagulation.
