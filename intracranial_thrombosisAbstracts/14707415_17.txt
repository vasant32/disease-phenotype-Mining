BACKGROUND: Idiopathic cerebral vein thrombosis (iCVT) represents approximately 30% of the cases of cerebral vein thrombosis (CVT). New, inherited - factor V Leiden (FVL) and prothrombin gene mutation (PTHRA20210) - and inherited/acquired - hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) - prothrombotic conditions have been detected recently. METHODS: We assessed fasting plasma homocysteine (Hcy) levels and main Hcy determinants, FVL and PTHRA(20210) in 30 patients with documented iCVT and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. RESULTS: A strong and significant association of PTHRA(20210) [30% (9/30) vs. 2.5% (1/40) iCVT vs. controls, respectively, p = 0.001; OR = 16.174, p = 0.002] and HHcy [13/30 (43.3%) vs. 4/40 (10%) iCVT vs. controls, respectively; p = 0.002, OR = 6.88, p = 0.002] with iCVT was found. CONCLUSIONS: PTHRA(20210) and HHcy should be considered when screening for thrombophilia and should be assessed in patients with a family or personal history of CVT.
