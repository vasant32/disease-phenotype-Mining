We report a child with acute lymphocytic leukaemia who developed simultaneous osteonecrosis of vertebrae and cerebral thrombosis during L-asparaginase therapy. Fibrinogen, antithrombin III and plasminogen were decreased. Fresh frozen plasma in addition to antithrombin III concentrates were used to replenish these haemostatic proteins. L-asparaginase induced coagulopathy may cause osteonecrosis.
