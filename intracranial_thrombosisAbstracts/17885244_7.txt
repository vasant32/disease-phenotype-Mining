BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Thromboembolic events are the most common complications of elective coil embolization of cerebral aneurysms. Administration of oral clopidogrel and/or aspirin could lower the thromboembolic complication rate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Records over a 10-year period were reviewed in a retrospective cohort study. For 369 consecutive elective coil embolization procedures, 25 patients received no antiplatelet drugs, 86 received antiplatelet drugs only after embolization, and 258 received antiplatelet drugs before and after embolization. RESULTS: Symptomatic thromboembolic complications (transient ischemic attack or stroke within 60 days) occurred in 4 (16%) of 25 when no antiplatelet drugs were given, in 2 (2.3%) of 86 when antiplatelet drugs were administered only after embolization, and in 5 (1.9%) of 258 when antiplatelet drugs were administered before and after embolization. The lower symptomatic thromboembolic complication rate in the patients who received any antiplatelet therapy was statistically significant (P = .004). Clots were visible intraprocedurally in 5 (4.5%) of 111 when no antiplatelet drugs were administered before procedures and in 4 (1.6%) of 258 when they were (P value not significant). None of the 9 was symptomatic postprocedurally, but 7 were lysed or mechanically disrupted. Extracerebral hemorrhagic complications occurred in 0 (0%) of 25 when no antiplatelet drugs were given and in 11 (3.2%) of 344 when they were (P value not significant). CONCLUSION: Oral clopidogrel and/or aspirin significantly lowered the symptomatic thromboembolic complication rate of elective coil embolization of unruptured cerebral aneurysms. There were trends toward a lower rate of intraprocedural clot formation in patients given antiplatelet drugs before procedures and a higher hemorrhagic complication rate in patients given antiplatelet drugs. Benefits of antiplatelet therapy appear to outweigh risks.
