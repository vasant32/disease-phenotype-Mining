The purpose of this study was to analyze the long-term mortality, functional recovery and long-term complications of cerebral vein and dural sinus thrombosis (CVDST) admitted to Portuguese hospitals. A follow-up of symptomatic CVDST admitted to Portuguese hospitals since 1980 was performed. Fifty-one patients (retrospective cases) were re-evaluated during 1996; 91 consecutively admitted patients from 6/1995 to 6/1998 were followed up to 1999. In 1996, 4 (8%) of the retrospective cases had died (3 patients died in the acute phase), 4 (8%) could not be reached, 33 (64%) had recovered completely (Rankin 0 or 1) and 3 (6%) were dependent. The prospective cases had a mean follow-up of 1 year: 6 (7%) patients died in the acute phase, one (1%) died during follow-up, 75 (82%) recovered completely, and only 1 (1%) was dependent. For the prospective cases, worsening after admission (OR = 18.2; 95% CI = 2.9-112.4) and encephalopathy as the presenting syndrome (OR = 7.1; 95% CI = 1.2-40.9) predicted death or dependency, while absence of aphasia (OR 6.7, 95% CI = 1.6-33) and no worsening after admission (OR = 5.9; 95% CI = 1.6-20) predicted total recovery. During follow-up of the prospective cases, 4 (5%) patients had thrombotic events, 8 (10%) patients experienced seizures, 9 (11%) complained of severe headaches and 1 patient suffered severe visual loss. The long-term functional prognosis of patients with CVDST was fairly good with complete recovery in the majority of cases. However, these patients had a moderate risk of further thrombotic events and seizures.
