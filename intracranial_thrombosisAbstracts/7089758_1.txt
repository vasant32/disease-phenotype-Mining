The universal prevalence of arterial hypertension among Blacks is no longer disputed, although there still remain unanswered questions. Hypertension among Blacks is nearly always primary (85% of cases), while the secondary form is synonymous with some type of renal disorder. A few 'associations' of hypertension exist. Diet may be significant, especially potassium deficiency as a result of high starch intake, low intake of potassium and other practices. Enigmatic clinical aspects include: (i) the absence of symptoms generally, especially in the presence of established severe clinical disease with and without target organ damage; (ii) the clinically apparent selective target organ damage; (iii) labile blood pressure readings at any stage; (iv) cerebral thrombosis and frequent blood pressure normalization; (v) cardiomyopathy in relation to hypertension; (vi) the discordance of morbid events; (vii) dramatic isolated morbid events, which suggest special vulnerability.
