Although venous thrombosis is one of the common complications in nephrotic patients, cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is rarely reported. CVT is so difficult to be detected by conventional diagnostic methods that it is sometimes overlooked despite its potential severity. We report a 79-year-old female with nephrotic syndrome due to systemic amyloidosis who suddenly altered mental status during her hospitalization. The underlying etiology had been not identified by physical examinations, various laboratory data, and repeated computed tomography, and finally she died. The post-mortem examination showed a massive thrombus impacted in intracranial left-sided transverse and sigmoid sinus. This case suggests that CVT can occur in a nephrotic patient who presents unexplained neurological signs and symptoms, which might not be detected only through conventional diagnostic tests.
