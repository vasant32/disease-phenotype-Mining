The association of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is rare. We are reporting two new cases. In one case, CVT is extensive concerning three sinuses and bilateral parietal cortical veins and, in the other case, only a cortical vein is involved. Both the patients presented had no thrombosis risk factors. There is certainly a link between these two pathologies. SIH should be considered as a risk factor of CVT. Modification of symptoms of SIH leading to CVT must be known to start early treatment.
