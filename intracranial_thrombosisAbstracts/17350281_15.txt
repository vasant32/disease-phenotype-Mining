Several types of CNS injury and various diseases are associated with the development of a glial scar. Astrocytes are major components of the glial scar. They are interconnected by gap junctions, with connexin43 (Cx43) being the most prominent channel protein. We applied a model of focal cerebral ischemia to study the spatio-temporal expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein, as well as of Cx43 mRNA and protein in gliotic tissue up to 60 days after injury. Reactive astrocytes enveloping the lesion up-regulated their Cx43 mRNA and protein. A band of reactive astrocytes filling in the lesion exhibited elevated Cx43 and showed a high degree of proliferation. Because of these findings, we hypothesize a role for Cx43 in glial scar formation, specifically in the proliferation of astrocytes.
