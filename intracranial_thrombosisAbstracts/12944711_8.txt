We studied the influence of very early seizures (within 48 h of stroke onset) on in-hospital mortality in a cohort of 452 consecutive patients with atherothrombotic infarction. These patients were selected from 2000 consecutive acute stroke patients registered in a prospective hospital-based stroke registry in Barcelona, Spain. A comparison of data between the nonseizure (n = 442) and seizure (n = 10) groups was made. Predictors of very early seizures were assessed by multivariate analysis. The in-hospital mortality rate was significantly higher in atherothrombotic stroke patients with very early seizures than in those without seizures (70 vs. 19.5%, p < 0.001). Independent predictors of in-hospital mortality included very early seizures, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, 85 years of age or older, altered consciousness, dizziness, parietal and pons involvement, and respiratory and cardiac complications. After multivariate analysis, atherothrombotic infarction of occipital topography and decreased consciousness appeared to be independent predictors of atherothrombotic stroke with very early seizures. Very early seizures constitute an important risk factor for in-hospital mortality after atherothrombotic stroke.
