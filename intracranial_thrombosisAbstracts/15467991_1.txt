INTRODUCTION: Recently, thyrotoxicosis has been described as a risk factor for cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) in some reported cases. We present a case of CVT associated to a subacute De Quervain's thyroiditis in a young female who was an heterozygous carrier for the G20210A mutation of the prothrombin gene. CASE REPORT: A 42-year-old female with irrelevant past medical history developed a thrombosis of the superior sagital and right transverse sinus in the initial phase of a subacute thyroiditis. Diagnosis was made by thyroid radioactive iodine uptake, and cerebral computerized tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance angiography. Treatment with aspirin and corticosteroids was started until thyroid function was normalized. When CVT diagnosis was made, the patient was treated with anticoagulation. Two months later, magnetic resonance imaging showed resolution of the CVT. The patient was diagnosed as an heterozygous carrier for the G20210A mutation of the prothrombin gene by genetic studies. CONCLUSIONS: Subacute thyroiditis might act as a risk factor for CVT, increasing the thrombotic risk in the presence of other acquired or hereditary prothrombotic factors, such as the G20210A mutation of the prothrombin gene in our patient.
