Sinovenous thrombosis is a definite cause of mortality or morbidity in newborns. Perinatal hypoxia is one of the well known risk factors. Two term newborns were diagnosed to have cerebral venous thrombosis after a hypoxic-ischemic insult. They were later found to have carnitine deficiency. Both of the patients died. Carnitine was previously shown to have inhibitory effects on thrombogenesis in experimental studies. The possible contribution of carnitine in thrombogenesis was discussed.
