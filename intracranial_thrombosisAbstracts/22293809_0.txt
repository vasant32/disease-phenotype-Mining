The hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a subcategory of idiopathic eosinophilia which is characterized by marked unexplained eosinophilia and evidence of tissue eosinophilia which leads to eosinophil-mediated organ damage. Cardiac and thromboembolic complications of HES are the common causes of mortality and morbidity. Here, we report a 54-year-old woman with HES who presented with simultaneously occurring cardiac thrombi, pulmonary embolism, and cerebrovascular thromboembolism.
