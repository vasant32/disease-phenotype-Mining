Serum thyroid hormones were measured in 62 cases of acute cerebrovascular apoplexy. Compared with the control group, T3, FT3 were markedly lowered and rT3, T4 and TSH were significantly increased with lowered T3/rT3 ratio. The patients were divided into two groups, according to whether there was hemorrhage in their CSF. Changes of serum thyroid hormones in cerebral haemorrhage were more remarkable than those observed in cerebral thrombosis. 16 cases with increased T4, FT4 were diagnosed as euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia. It was found that the amount of thyroid hormone changes appeared to be in proportion to the severity of acute cerebrovascular apoplexy. The determination of serum thyroid hormones would be useful in evaluating the severity of the strokes and in studying the thyroid function in acute cerebrovascular apoplexy.
