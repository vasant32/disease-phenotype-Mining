OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical characteristic and common etiologies of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) in China. METHODS: Clinical and neuroimaging data of 91 cases of CVT were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: 91 CVT patients (49 men, 42 women), aged from 9 to 57 years, were diagnosed with MRI (78 cases, 85.71%), MRA (37 cases, 40.66%) or DSA (32 cases, 35.16%). 27 cases (29.67%) had a clinical pattern of isolated intracranial hypertension, 56 cases (61.54%) of focal deficits and/or seizures, 3 cases of subacute encephalopathy and 5 cases of cavernous sinus thrombosis. Oral contraceptive was the most common cause, being found in 12 cases (13.19%). CONCLUSIONS: Understanding of the clinical characteristics of CVT and using of MRI and MRA examination as early as possible is the key in CVT diagnosis. Oral contraceptive is the most common etiology.
