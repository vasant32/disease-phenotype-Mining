The activity of thrombinogenesis process is shown by thrombin restrain reaction by its physiological inhibitor antithrombin III, as a result of which biologically nonactive thrombinantithrombin III complexes (TAT) are created. The aim of the study was to evaluate TAT complexes in the blood of ischaemic stroke patients. 25 persons with ischaemic stroke and 15 controls took part in the examination. Taking into consideration brain CT outcomes 2 groups of patients were selected: with ischaemic stroke of small and great extent. The patients were also divided into a group of patients with less severe and with more severe ischaemic stroke, and into a group of patients with ischaemic stroke with and without accompanying atrial fibrillation. TAT complexes were determined with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method on days 1st, 5th, and 12th after ischaemic stroke onset. TAT complexes were significantly higher in patients with cerebral infarction than in controls, significantly higher in patients with ischaemic stroke of great extent compared to patients with ischaemic stroke of small extent, and significantly higher in patients with more severe cerebral infarction than in patients with less severe cerebral infarction. In patients with cerebral infarction and atrial fibrillation TAT complexes were significantly higher only on the 1st day of the disease compared to patients with cerebral infarction without atrial fibrillation. Our investigations confirm intense activity of thrombinogenesis process in ischaemic stroke patients.
