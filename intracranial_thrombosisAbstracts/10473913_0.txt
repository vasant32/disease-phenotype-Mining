Thromboangiitis obliterans is a chronic inflammatory vessel disease that involves predominantly the small and medium-sized arteries and veins of the distal extremities. Appearance and cessation of symptoms are closely related to patterns of tobacco consumption. That cerebral arteries can also be involved is shown by reports of rare cases in which cerebral artery occlusion led to infarction. We report on a 28-year-old man with thromboangiitis obliterans who developed extensive cerebral vein thrombosis after a single episode of cigarette smoking following several years of nonsmoking. Despite extensive evaluation, no other known cause or predisposition of cerebral vein thrombosis could be found. This case suggests that cerebral veins can be involved in thromboangiitis obliterans and patients with thromboangiitis obliterans might be at risk for cerebral vein thrombosis.
