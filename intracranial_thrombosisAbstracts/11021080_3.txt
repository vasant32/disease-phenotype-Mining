A 77-year-old female presented with a giant aneurysm of the azygos anterior cerebral artery (ACA) manifesting as acute onset of akinetic mutism caused by enlargement of the aneurysm resulting from rapid thrombus formation within the aneurysmal sac. Thrombus removal to obtain decompression of the aneurysmal bulk and tension was performed before parent artery occlusion to prevent thromboembolic events. The aneurysmal neck was completely clipped with preservation of the parent artery and all branches. This strategy for direct neck clipping of a giant thrombosed distal ACA aneurysm can reduce the possibility of ischemic sequelae.
