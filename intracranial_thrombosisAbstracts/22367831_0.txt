Capsular warning syndrome is characterized by recurrent transient ischemic attacks and is caused by microthrombosis or hypoperfusion of small-sized vessels. The pathophysiological basis of this syndrome is not well understood and currently a consensus has not been reached on its optimal treatment. In this study, we present 2 cases with favorable clinical outcomes after combined antithrombotic treatment with loading doses of clopidogrel and aspirin.
