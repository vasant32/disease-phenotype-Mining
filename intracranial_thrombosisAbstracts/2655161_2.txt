The effects of the newly developed synthetic selective antithrombin agent MD-805 were examined in 11 patients with progressing cerebral thrombosis, as an open trial. Nine (82%) of 11 patients improved after 1 week of intravenous drip infusion. No hemorrhagic complications were observed during the therapy. These results suggest that MD-805 is a safe and effective agent for treatment of progressing cerebral thrombosis.
