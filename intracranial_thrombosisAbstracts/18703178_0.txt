INTRODUCTION: Onset of cerebral thrombophlebitis following parotidectomy in a child is reported. OBSERVATION: A seven-year-old boy presenting apparently benign tumefaction in the right parotid gland area had undergone a conservative right total parotidectomy. The histological examination of the operative specimen suggested a diffuse neurofibroma as part of a clinical picture of Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis. The immediate postoperative follow-up was marked by a pyramidal syndrome in the left hemibody, with the CT scan showing thrombophlebitis. After treatment combining an anticoagulant, a vasodilator and an antibiotic, the patient progressed toward partial recovery of left hemibody motor activity. COMMENTS: This cerebral vascular accident is related to the angiodysplasia encountered in Recklinghausen's disease. Anticoagulants initialized rapidly are the only demonstrated therapy to improve the prognosis in this type of complication.
