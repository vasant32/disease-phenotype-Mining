OBJECTIVE: To assess the technical feasibility of using a retrievable, closed cell intracranial stent delivered through a microcatheter for safe removal of foreign bodies or clot. METHODS: In vitro and in vivo testing were performed to demonstrate the feasibility of using retrievable intracranial stents for foreign body or clot removal. In vitro testing was performed in an anatomically correct silicone vascular replica by partially deploying the stent around a coil, then retracting the stent into the microcatheter to trap the coil. Withdrawal of the stent delivery system into the guide catheter resulted in coil removal. Subsequently, the technique was evaluated in a porcine model of intracranial aneurysms, wherein both fresh clot and herniated coils were extracted from the carotid arteries. RESULTS: In these experimental procedures, both herniated coils and fresh clot were safely and easily removed from the in vitro and in vivo models. No periprocedural adverse events were observed. CONCLUSION: These in vitro and in vivo studies suggest the potential use of retrievable stents for the removal of foreign bodies or clot from the intracranial circulation.
