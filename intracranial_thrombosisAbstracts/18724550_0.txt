In two patients with headache and seeing disorders on the basis of angio-MR examination venous thrombosis and thrombosinusitis of the brain and of internal jugular was diagnosed. The cases presented pay direct attention at the disproportion between the scope of the thrombotic process and a low-symptom and nonspecific clinical picture. In the first case after applying standard heparin, we obtained a nearly complete recanalisation of the vessels; in the second patient after application of low-molecular-weight heparin recanalisation didn't occur. So far no standards of therapeutic proceedings have been established in venous thrombosis and thrombo-sinusitis of the brain. It is still a very serious diagnostic and therapautic problem.
