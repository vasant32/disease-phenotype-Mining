Cadmium (Cd), an environmental and industrial pollutant, poses a potential threat and affects many systems in human and animals. Although several reports on Cd toxicity were presented, the acute effect of Cd on systemic and thrombotic events was not reported so far. Cd (2.284 mg/kg) or saline (control) was injected intraperitoneally (ip), and the systemic parameters were assessed in mice. Compared to control group, acute intraperitoneal injection of Cd, in mice showed significant quickening of platelet aggregation (P<0.001) leading to pial cerebral thrombosis. Likewise, Cd exposure caused a significant increase in white blood cell numbers (P<0.05) indicating the occurrence of systemic inflammation. Also, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (P<0.05) and creatinine (P<0.01) levels were both significantly increased. Interestingly, the superoxide dismutase activity was significantly decreased in Cd treated group compared to control group (P<0.001), suggesting the occurrence of oxidative stress. We conclude that the Cd exposure in mice causes acute thromboembolic events, oxidative stress and alter liver and kidney functions.
