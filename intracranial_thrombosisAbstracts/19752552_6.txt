BACKGROUND: The antithrombotic, antiplatelet and endothelial activity of terutroban, a specific thromboxane prostaglandin receptor antagonist, was assessed in patients previously treated with aspirin for the prevention of ischemic stroke. METHODS: This double-blind, parallel-group, 10-day study included 48 patients (age = 70.5 +/- 9.5 years) with cerebral ischemic event and/or carotid stenosis in 4 groups: terutroban 10 mg/day (n = 13), aspirin 300 mg/day (n = 12), terutroban 10 mg/day + aspirin 300 mg/day (n = 11) or clopidogrel 75 mg/day + aspirin 300 mg/day (n = 12). The measurements included parameters from an ex vivo model of thrombosis, platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma and plasma biomarkers of endothelial/platelet activation. RESULTS: Between days 0 and 10, the mean cross-sectional surface of dense thrombus significantly decreased with terutroban (58%, p = 0.001), terutroban + aspirin (63%, p = 0.005) and clopidogrel + aspirin (61%, p < 0.05). On day 10, the value for terutroban was significantly lower than that for aspirin (p < 0.01) and was comparable to the dual therapy terutroban + aspirin or clopidogrel + aspirin. Similar results were found for total thrombus surface and platelet adhesion. Platelet aggregation induced by the specific thromboxane prostaglandin receptor agonist U46619 was almost completely inhibited on day 10 in both terutroban groups but not in the others. As regards markers of endothelial/platelet activation or lesions, thrombomodulin significantly increased and plasma soluble P selectin significantly decreased by day 10 in both terutroban groups, whereas the von Willebrand factor did not change significantly. Terutroban was found to be safe and well TOLERATED. CONCLUSIONS: Terutroban has demonstrated an antithrombotic activity that is superior to aspirin and similar to clopidogrel + aspirin; it induces a significant in vivo reduction in endothelial/platelet activation.
