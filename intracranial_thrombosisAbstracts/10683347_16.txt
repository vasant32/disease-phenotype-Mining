BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that hyperfibrinogenemia is an independent risk factor for cerebrovascular atherosclerosis. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We studied whether hyperfibrinogenemia could modify the histological composition of atherosclerotic plaque and precipitate carotid thrombosis resulting from rupture of the plaque. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied the histological composition of 71 carotid atherosclerotic plaques from patients who had undergone surgical endarterectomy after a first episode of transient ischemic attack. Patients were divided into 3 groups corresponding to the tertiles of plasma fibrinogen values. Hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking habit were also assessed. At the histological analysis, plaques of patients in the highest tertile of fibrinogen (>407 mg/dL) were characterized by a high incidence of thrombosis (66.7% of cases) compared with plaques of subjects in the lower (21.7%) (P=0.002) and middle (29. 2%) (P=0.009) tertiles. Plaque rupture was significantly associated with high fibrinogen levels (54.2%, P=0.003). Multivariate logistic regression indicated that hyperfibrinogenemia was an independent risk factor for a decrease in cap thickness (P=0.0005), macrophage foam cell infiltration of the cap (P=0.003), and thrombosis (P=0. 003). When the presence of other risk factors was accounted for, hyperfibrinogenemia remained an independent predictor of carotid thrombosis with an odds ratio of 5.83, compared with other risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study add to the evidence that hyperfibrinogenemia, independently of other risk factors, is associated with a specific histological composition of carotid atherosclerotic plaques that predisposes them to rupture and thrombosis.
