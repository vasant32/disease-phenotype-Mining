Acute cerebral thrombosis and embolism give rise to arterial spasm, edema, and anoxia of the cerebral tissues supplied by the affected artery or arteries. Sympathetic block induced by injecting the stellate ganglion with procaine appears to relieve spasm and results in improved cerebral circulation and clinical improvement in a significant number of cases. Sympathetic block should be combined with the usual supportive measures and not infrequently with anticoagulants. Every effort should be made to institute treatment as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms.
