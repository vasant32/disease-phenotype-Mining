Enhancement of intracranial thrombosed aneurysms is an uncommon finding on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and can present diagnostic difficulties and complicate management decisions. We report a 46-year-old man who had an enhancing thrombosed intracranial aneurysm observed on 3T MR imaging. There was angiographical correlation, with follow-up serial MR imaging documenting regression and improvement. Findings are typical for benign intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia. Differential diagnoses of giant serpentine intracranial aneurysm and malignant angiosarcoma are discussed.
