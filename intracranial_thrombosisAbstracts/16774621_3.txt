OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the contribution of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) and thrombomodulin (Thm) in the pathogenesis of stroke and migraine in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety children were included in the study: 30 children (4-15 years) after an ischemic stroke of an unknown etiology; 30 migrainous patients (8-15 years), who were hospitalized in the Department of Developmental Neurology, Medical University of Gdansk, Poland, and 30 healthy children of the same age. RESULTS: The statistical analysis showed an increase in the values of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL), anti beta2-glycoprotein 1 (beta2-GP1) and Thm in children with stroke and migraine than in the control group. The resultant values were higher, but stayed at standard. CONCLUSION: The possible role of prothrombotic factors in individual cases of pediatric stroke and migraine cannot be excluded.
