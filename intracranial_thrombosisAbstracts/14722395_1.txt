We report a 69-year-old woman with intracranial pachymeningitis showing hypopituitarism, diabetes insipidus, and Tolosa-Hunt syndrome associated with Hashimoto thyroiditis confirmed by autopsy. A large tumorous lesion of the hypothalamo-pituitary gland was revealed on magnetic resonance imaging, after the patient complained of gait and visual field disturbance. These symptoms subsided after thyroid hormone supplementation. Hypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus were diagnosed after cessation of the treatment by the patient herself. Multiple cranial nerve palsies and orbito-frontalgia appeared. Methylprednisolone pulse therapy improved the symptoms, but they recurred when the dose of glucocorticoid was decreased. The patient died of brain thrombosis. Autopsy revealed typical findings of Hashimoto thyroiditis and intracranial pachymeningitis involving the cranial base and pituitary gland. The high titer of rheumatoid factor and Hashimoto thyroiditis in this patient suggest an immunological role in the pathogenesis of pachymeningitis.
