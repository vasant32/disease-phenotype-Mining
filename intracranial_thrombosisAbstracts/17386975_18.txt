Plasminogen activators are used in thrombolytic stroke therapy. However, it is increasingly recognized that they have other actions besides fibrinolysis. In this study, we assess potential pro-inflammatory effects of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) in rat cortical astrocytes. Both uPA and tPA induced rapid dose-dependent upregulation in MMP-2 and MMP-9, as demonstrated by zymography of conditioned media. In addition, a multiplex ELISA array demonstrated that patterned responses in chemokines and cytokines were also evoked. Exposure to tPA induced elevations in secreted MIP-2, MCP-1 and GRO/KC. Exposure to uPA induced elevations in secreted IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, GMCSF, MIP-1alpha, MIP-2, MIP-3alpha, MCP-1, RANTES and fractalkine. These data suggest that plasminogen activators may trigger selected pro-inflammatory responses at the neurovascular interface. Whether these effects influence thrombolytic stroke therapy warrants further investigation.
