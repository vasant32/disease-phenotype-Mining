Thyroid storm is a rare and life-threatening complication of untreated thyrotoxicosis. A number of neurological complications have been described in association with thyrotoxicosis. We report the case of a 28-year-old woman with a thyroid storm on the basis of Graves' disease and probably triggered by a surgical procedure. She developed cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) of the left transverse and rectus sinus with a venous infarction of the left thalamus. Except for an increased factor VIII clotting activity there were no thrombophilic abnormalities. Similar cases have been described in the literature and the reported incidence of the combination of CVT and thyrotoxicosis is significantly higher than expected by chance alone (0.1 x 10(-6) per year vs. 0.0032 x 10(-6)/year). This case is consistent with the assumption that thyrotoxicosis, probably through a factor VIII-mediated hypercoagulability, may be a predisposing factor for the development of CVT.
