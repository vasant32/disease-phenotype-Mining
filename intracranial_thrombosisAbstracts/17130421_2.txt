Thin-section noncontrast CT (NCT) can detect thrombi in large arteries and can provide a measure of thrombus composition based on Hounsfield Units (HU). A study using polyethylene tubes as a model of intracranial arteries concluded that the HUs of platelet-rich thrombi are lower than those of erythrocyte-rich thrombi. Thrombus HUs were measured by NCT in 34 patients with acute ischemic stroke before thrombolysis. Thrombi with lower HU counts were resistant to thrombolytics.
