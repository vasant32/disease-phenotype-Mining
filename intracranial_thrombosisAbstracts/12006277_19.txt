Three patients with internal carotid artery thrombus and thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) 0-1 flow were treated by using intraarterial (IA) suction thrombectomy a mean of 4.2 hours after stroke onset. After catheterization with a 7F guide-catheter, thrombus was aspirated by using a 60-mL syringe. TIMI flow improved to 3 in all patients. The median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score decreased from 22 (range, 12-23) to 4 (range, 2-22) at 3 months. IA suction thrombectomy may be safe and feasible in patients with acute stroke.
