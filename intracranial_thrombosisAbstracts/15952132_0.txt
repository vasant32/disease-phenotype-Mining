OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the frequency of prothrombin (FII) gene 3'-untranslated region (3'-UT) G20210A variant and to explore whether this mutation is related to arterial thrombosis in Chinese Zhuang population. METHODS: Seventy-six patients with cerebral thrombosis, 23 patients with myocardial infarction and 106 healthy Chinese Zhuang persons were studied. The G20210A mutant allele of the prothrombin gene in all blood specimens was investigated by DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction amplification, Hind III digestion and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: The patients and normal control subjects were all homozygous for the normal G20210G allele, and there was no FII G20210A variant. CONCLUSION: Factor II gene 3'-UT G20210A mutant allele is absent in the 99 Chinese Zhuang ethnic patients with ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction and is absent in 106 normal healthy Zhuang people. FII G20210A mutation may not be a major risk factor for thrombogenesis in ethnic Chinese.
