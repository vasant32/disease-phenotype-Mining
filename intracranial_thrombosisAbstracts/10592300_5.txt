This study aimed at developing a dual setup of the photothrombotic ring stroke model with or without late spontaneous reperfusion in the region at risk and to explore the morphological consequences. The exposed crania of adult male Wistar rats were subjected to a ring-shaped laser-irradiation beam (o.d. 5.0 mm, 0.35 mm thick) for 2 min simultaneously with intravenous erythrosin B (17 mg/kg) infusion. Transcardial carbon-black perfusion revealed that a laser intensity of 0.90 W/cm(2) resulted in late, that is, starting at 72 h, spontaneous reperfusion, whereas the lowest laser intensity that produced lack of reperfusion at 7 days post-irradiation was 1.84 W/cm(2). Laser-Doppler flowmetry showed prompt cortical cerebral blood flow (cCBF) reduction both in the ring lesion and region at risk (12% and 25% of control values) after high-intensity irradiation; these reduced flow values were more rapid and pronounced than in the low-intensity irradiation setup as previously shown. The high- compared with low-intensity irradiation setup produced more frequent occurrence of thrombi in the ring-lesion region and a larger ischemic cortical lesion with a more rapid pace of ischemic cellular changes in the ring-lesion region and the region at risk. The region at risk transformed into pannecrosis in the high-intensity, but recovered morphologically in the low-intensity irradiation setup. This dual photothrombotic setup with or without spontaneous reperfusion enables the study of events related to ischemic cell survival or death in an anatomically predefined region at risk.
