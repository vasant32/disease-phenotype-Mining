To compare cerebral circulation in aphasic patients who had cerebral hemorrhage against those who with cerebral thrombosis, we studies 50 patients with hypertensive intracranial (putaminal) hemorrhage and 20 patients with cerebral thrombosis whose diagnoses were confirmed on repeated CT scan and cerebral angiography. The measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) by the 133Xe intraarterial injection method was carried out in 40 patients. The evolution of the aphasic syndrome was analyzed according to Hirano's classification and the patients were divided into two groups: those having a favorable recovery from aphasia; those with a poor recovery. Twelve out of 20 patients with cerebral hemorrhage showed a favorable recovery from aphasia, whose left hemispheric mean blood flow (mCBF) was 33.1 +/- 9.7 ml/100 g/min. The mCBF was 30.8 +/- 10.3 ml/100 g/min in 8 patients with a poor recovery. There was no significant difference in mCBF values between the two groups. The favorable recovery group showed slightly higher regional values in the left frontal and temporal lobes than did the poor recovery group, but no significant difference was found between the two group. Here, rCBF values failed to correlate between the two kinds of recovery from aphasia in patients with cerebral hemorrhage. The marked variability in rCBF values in the acute stage might partly account for the poor correlation in cerebral hemorrhage. In contrast, a series of rCBF studies demonstrated that rCBF values stabilized in the acute and subacute stage in cerebral thrombosis. Nine out of 20 patients with cerebral thrombosis had a favorable recovery from aphasia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
