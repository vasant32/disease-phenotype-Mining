Thalidomide has been associated with venous thrombotic events, as reported in the post-marketing surveillance reports by Celgene Corporation; as well as case reports in the literature. Seven arterial thrombotic events have been reported in patients receiving thalidomide with 3 cases occurring in patients with other predisposing conditions. We report 4 additional cases of arterial thromboses in 1 lymphoma and 3 myeloma patients treated with thalidomide. The mechanism for these events is unclear; however, it is significant that 2 patients were receiving concomitant anticoagulation with aspirin and warfarin.
