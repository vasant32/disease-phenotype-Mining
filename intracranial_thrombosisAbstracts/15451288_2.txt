BACKGROUND: A very rare case of a ruptured aneurysm induced by ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate is reported. CASE DESCRIPTION: Six years earlier, this 68-year-old woman had undergone microvascular decompression for trigeminal neuralgia during which the left vertebral artery, which compressed the exit zone of the trigeminal nerve, had been detached and fixed to the dura mater of the petrous bone with ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate. Shortly thereafter she underwent microvascular decompression for left-side facial palsy; again ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate was used. Six years later, she suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage because of rupture of a new aneurysm of the left vertebral artery. She was referred to our hospital where coil embolization was attempted on the day following the insult. However, the left vertebral artery and the aneurysm could not be occluded completely, and she suddenly died 20 days later from rerupture of the aneurysm. CONCLUSION: This is the first pathologic report of a ruptured de novo aneurysm induced by ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate. We suggest that arterial wall damage by ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate may have contributed to the development of the de novo aneurysm.
