Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is not uncommon, but CVT associated with bilateral internal jugular vein stenosis (BIJVS) is rare. Bilateral internal jugular vein stenting is also a rare procedure. We report on a patient with CVT associated with BIJVS, who was treated successfully using direct thrombolysis and bilateral internal jugular vein stenting.
