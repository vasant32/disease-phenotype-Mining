Thrombotic accidents in the newborn, particularly cerebrovascular accidents, are reported in case of abnormalities in the coagulation system and rarely in heterozygous protein C deficiency; a low protein C level could be either physiological or acquired. CASE REPORT: Two cases of heterozygous protein C deficiency are reported in neonates. Severe neurologic distress was associated with bloody cerebrospinal fluid, and hemorrhagic lesions due to cerebral sinovenous occlusion were visualised by cerebral imaging. The course was severe. One case was associated with renal thrombosis. Mutation in the 168 proline/leucine was detected by molecular biology in the neonates and their mothers. In one case a treatment with protein C had no beneficial effect. CONCLUSION: Cerebral sinus venous thrombosis has to be sought by magnetic resonance imaging in the case of neurologic distress with profound cerebral hemorrhage in the newborn. A low level of protein C has to be interpreted with caution. The diagnosis of a heterozygous deficiency status can only be made through molecular biology. The effect of treatment with protein C concentrate is questionable.
