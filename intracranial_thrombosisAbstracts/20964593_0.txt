Aneurysms of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) are a rare entity. Purely intrameatal aneurysms are even rarer. The authors report an intrameatal thrombosed AICA aneurysm mimicking a vestibular schwannoma that was treated by resection and end-to-end anastomosis. This 22-year-old man presented with acute hearing loss, vertigo, and moderate facial palsy. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an atypical intrameatal lesion with dilation of the internal auditory canal. Microsurgical inspection via a retrosigmoid approach and drilling of the posterior wall of the internal auditory canal revealed a thrombosed AICA aneurysm. The aneurysm was excised, and an end-to-end suture was performed to restore AICA continuity. Intraoperative indocyanine green videoangiography as well as postoperative digital substraction angiography showed a good revascularization. Intrameatal AICA aneurysms may present with symptoms similar to vestibular schwannomas. End-to-end reanastomosis after aneurysm resection is a treatment option when clipping is impossible.
