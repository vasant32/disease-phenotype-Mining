Polycythemia vera (PV) is characterized by an increased RBC mass, spontaneous erythroid colony formation, and the JAK2V617F mutation. PV is associated with a high risk of mesenteric and cerebral thrombosis. PV RBC adhesion to endothelial laminin is increased and mediated by phosphorylated erythroid Lu/BCAM. In the present work, we investigated the mechanism responsible for Lu/BCAM phosphorylation in the presence of JAK2V617F using HEL and BaF3 cell lines as well as RBCs from patients with PV. High levels of Rap1-GTP were found in HEL and BaF3 cells expressing JAK2V617F compared with BaF3 cells with wild-type JAK2. This finding was associated with increased Akt activity, Lu/BCAM phosphorylation, and cell adhesion to laminin that were inhibited by the dominant-negative Rap1S17N or by the specific Rap1 inhibitor GGTI-298. Surprisingly, knocking-down EpoR in HEL cells did not alter Akt activity or cell adhesion to laminin. Our findings reveal a novel EpoR-independent Rap1/Akt signaling pathway that is activated by JAK2V617F in circulating PV RBCs and responsible for Lu/BCAM activation. This new characteristic of JAK2V617F could play a critical role in initiating abnormal interactions among circulating and endothelial cells in patients with PV.
