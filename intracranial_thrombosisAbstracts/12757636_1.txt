OBJECTIVE: To test feasibility, safety and efficacy of combined intraarterial thrombolysis and intra-cerebral stent for acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: From 2001-5 to 2002-8, 19 patients with acute onset of stroke were treated with intraaterial thrombolysis followed by intra-cerebral stent. 9 located in middle cerebral artery (MCA), 10 located in basal artery (BA). For each patient, intraarterial thrombolysis of MCA or BA was applied at first, stent angioplasty was applied at the stenosis left after the thrombolysis by using the stent for coronary artery. RESULTS: All the 19 patients left stenosis after intraaterial thrombolysis, and the average stenosis was 85% in diameter. After the operation of stent, the images showed the vascular is smooth and had no stenosis left. The symptoms were disappeared or improved. Thrombus formation in the stent occurred on 1 patient 24 hours after the operation. TIA never occurred in the left 18 patients then. TCD follow up showed blood flow is normal. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasibility of intraaterial thrombosis followed by intra-cerebral stent. And it is valid for preventing occlusion again of the vessel and decreasing the rate of TIA occurring.
