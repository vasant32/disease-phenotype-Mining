BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is an uncommon condition with many clinical manifestations, and hereditary prothrombotic conditions such as factor Leiden V, deficiency of protein S, protein C and antithrombin III, as well as prothrombin gene mutation, may account for 10-15% of cases. To date, conflicting results have been reported for recurrent venous thrombosis in the patients with factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutation, since some studies have shown a higher risk for recurrent venous thrombosis in carriers of these two mutations than in non-carriers, and the last study showed higher risk only for carriers of double defect (homozygous or double heterozygous for this mutations). METHODS: Case report is presented. RESULTS: We report a case of cerebral sinus thrombosis as a recurrent thrombotic event in a patient with heterozygous prothrombin G20210A genotype after discontinuation of oral anticoagulation therapy. CONCLUSION: Since many facts are controversial, the use of secondary prophylaxis for thrombosis in these patients is still a matter of debate without clear consensus recommendation. Data on the risk of recurrent thrombotic events in thrombophilic patient is insufficient. The main unclear question concerning these patients is: how long and whom should we treat with long-term anticoagulant therapy as secondary prophylaxis of DVT? The problem for practitioner is that we do not have guidelines and precise recommendations for secondary thromboprophylaxis in this or similar cases. This case is remarkable for its favorable and quick outcome and its rarity, because CSVT is an uncommon condition and heterozygous prothrombin G20210A genotype was only found predisposing factor for CSVT. Further studies of risk of recurrent venous thrombosis in patients with heterozygous prothrombin G20210A genotype with the larger sample size are required.
