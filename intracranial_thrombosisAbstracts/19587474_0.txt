Basilar artery thrombosis has high morbidity and mortality. Though intra-arterial thrombolytics have proven efficacy in the treatment of acute basilar artery occlusion, the elevation of procoagulant factors in the blood after intra-arterial thrombolysis could result in subsequent thrombus formation and clinical deterioration. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors have been shown to reduce this elevation in procoagulants. We present a pilot study of three cases of acute basilar artery occlusion treated with a combination of intra-arterial thrombolytics and Gp IIb/IIIa inhibitor with remarkable clinical recovery seen in all the patients.
