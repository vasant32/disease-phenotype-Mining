A 42-year-old male was admitted to Tokyo University Hospital because of confusion, aphasia and right hemiparesis. Cranial computed tomography and cerebral angiography demonstrated cerebral infarction due to occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery, while chest roentgenography disclosed a nodular shadow in the right upper lobe and swelling of right hilar and paratracheal lymph nodes. These findings suggested carcinoma of pulmonary origin and tumor-associated cerebral thrombosis, but a possibility of gastric cancer was raised by the finding of cervical lymph node biopsy which revealed signet ring cells in metastatic adenocarcinoma. He developed disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome and died on the 83rd hospital day. Autopsy revealed adenocarcinoma of the lung with signet ring cells and non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis which appeared to be responsible for the cerebral infarction. The relationship between adenocarcinoma of the lung with signet ring cells and non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis was discussed.
