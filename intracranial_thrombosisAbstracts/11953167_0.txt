OBJECTIVE: To study the level of plasma lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in patients with TIA, cerebral thrombosis or possible ischemic attack. METHODS: Phospholipid was extracted from plasma of patients with TIA, cerebral thrombosis or possible ischemic attack by organic solvent. Lysophosphatidic acid was isolated further. The quantity of LPA was determined by assaying its phosphorous component. RESULTS: LPA level of patients with TIA, cerebral thrombosis or possible ischemic attack were 2.14 +/- 1.02, 1.50 +/- 0.85, and 1.73 +/- 1.14 micromol/L blood plasma respectively, all significantly higher than that in control group (1.00 +/- 0.70 micromol/L, P < 0.05). The plasma LPA level decreased after anticoagulant treatment. CONCLUSION: As a molecular marker released by activated platelets in vivo, plasma PLA may be valuable in diagnosis of cerebral ischemic attack.
