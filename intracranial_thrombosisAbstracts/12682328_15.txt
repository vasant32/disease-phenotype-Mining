The authors studied 16 consecutive cases of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). Clinical outcome was good or excellent in 14 patients. Comprehensive hypercoagulable screening was done at least 3 months after the onset of CVT, including evaluation of genetic coagulation disorders and plasma levels of homocysteine and factor VIII. This screening was positive in 12 patients (75%). An acquired prothrombotic factor was identified in 9 of these 12 patients. Elevation of factor VIII plasma level was the most common coagulation disorder (8 patients).
