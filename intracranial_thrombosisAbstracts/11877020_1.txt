OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of FXII on fibrinolysis in patients with cerebral thrombosis. METHODS: Plasma level of FXII:C, FXII:Ag, FXIIa and beta FXIIa and fibrinolysis activities were examined by ELISA. Screening of FXII gene mutation by MOEA. RESULTS: FXII:C in 22 of 107 patients with cerebral thrombosis decreased, which was similar to the feature of FXII cross-reacting material positive (FXII CRM(+)). There were significant increase in plasma levels of PLG:A and alpha(2)AP:A and decrease in D-dimer, moreover, plasma levels of FXIIa and betaFXIIa were lower in patients than in controls. FXII gene mutation was not found in 22 of 107 patients. CONCLUSION: Decrease of FXII:C may play an important role in cerebral thrombosis by reducing activation of plasminogen. The gene mutation of FXII CRM(+)-like abnormal FXII was different from the known FXII gene mutation. Mutations in the regions of FXII Arg (334) and Arg (353) may be more important for the reducing of FXIIa, beta FXIIa levels and fibrinolysis activities. FXII assay should be included in thrombotic disorder screening.
