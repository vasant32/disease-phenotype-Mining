 BACKGROUND: Thromboembolism is a complication of acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy in children. The majority of thromboembolic events are cerebral thromboses and deep venous thromboses; many asymptomatic deep venous thromboses are detected in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia by instrumental screening. The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of asymptomatic cerebral thromboembolic events in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) screened by magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance venography. METHODS: 46 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, during the induction phase of the AIEOP ALL 2000 protocol, were stratified into 2 groups. In group "A" cerebral thromboembolic events were suspected following the appearance of suggestive signs and symptoms and confirmed by cerebral magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance venography; in group "B" children underwent a screening by cerebral magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance venography, at set times, in absence of symptoms. RESULTS: We observed one cerebral thromboembolic event in both groups; we found no differences between early detecting asymptomatic cerebral thromboembolic events among monitored and not monitored patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study does not seem to suggest a screening for asymptomatic cerebral thromboembolic events in children with ALL during the induction phase.
