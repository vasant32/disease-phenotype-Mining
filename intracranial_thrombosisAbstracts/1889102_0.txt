Antithrombotic xinmaining were composed with Moschus, Calculus Bovis, Borneol, Radix Ligusticum, Flos Sophorae Immaturus, Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae, Leech, etc. This preparation was suitable for treating channels and collaterals type of cerebral thrombosis. The dosage was 2-4 capsules (0.5 g/capsule) oral administration twice per day, 3-4 weeks as a therapeutic course. The authors studied 158 cases of these patients compared with 117 cases of control group with dextran and Vinorutone. The clinical result showed that the obvious effective rate in the therapeutic group was 62.1% and the total effective rate 96.3%; the values in the control group were 38.5% and 86.3% respectively (P less than 0.01). The laboratory results showed that the blood viscosity, serum viscosity, hematocrit (vol %), RBC electrophoresis rate (micron/sec/v/cm) and platelet aggregation rate (%) before antithrombotic xinmaining administration were 5.82 +/- 0.82, 1.82 +/- 0.02, 52.81 +/- 6.70, 0.82 +/- 0.19 and 28.33 +/- 12.02 respectively; and those after the treatment were 4.72 +/- 0.65, 1.70 +/- 0.02, 48.76 +/- 0.40, 0.97 +/- 0.17 and 23.05 +/- 10.01 (mean +/- S), P less than 0.01. The toxicological study proved that the preparation was safe, no significant side-effect and good for cerebral thrombosis medication.
