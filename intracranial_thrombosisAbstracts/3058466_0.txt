Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma levels of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) were measured by RIA in 46 patients with acute intracranial diseases, ie, cerebral bleeding (group A), cerebral thrombosis (B), head injury (C) and meningitis (D), and the results were compared to those obtained in 21 patients with non-intracranial diseases (group E; control). Immunoreactive LHRH concentrations in CSF (CSF IR-LHRH) of 8 postmenopausal women in group E ranged 1.3 to 6.1 (mean +/- SE: 3.1 +/- 0.6) pg/ml, and those of 5 other women and 8 men with group E ranged 1.0 to 5.6 (3.6 +/- 0.4)pg/ml. In 7 out of 15 patients in group A(7/15), CSF IR-LHRH were above the levels seen in group E. In group B, C and D, CSF IR-LHRH were above the control levels in 9/15, 1/9, 3/7, respectively. The changes in plasma LHRH were not clear in postmenopausal patients in groups A and B. Plasma IR-LHRH in other women and men in group A were above the control levels in 2 out of 9 patients (2/9). Those in groups B, C and D were above the control levels in 3/8, 1/9, 2/7, respectively. Moreover, both plasma and CSF IR-LHRH of 13 patients in group A or B in chronic stage were within the control ranges. In cases observed following the time course, the occasionally increased IR-LHRH in plasma and CSF tended to decrease following the abatement of the diseases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
