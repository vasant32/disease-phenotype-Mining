 AIM: The purpose of this study is to detect gene expression patterns following     focal cerebral ischemia. MATERIAL and METHODS: 25 male Wistar rats were divided     into control (n = 8) and ischemic (n = 17) groups. In the ischemic group, slowly     progressing focal ischemia was simulated by two-vein occlusion with spreading     depression (SD) a cortical microinjection of KCl induced. Ischemic tissue was     removed at 2, 8, 24, or 72 h postischemia. Using semiquantitative reverse     transcription polymerase chain reaction, we investigated mRNA expression levels     of 13 representative genes related to cerebral ischemia. Cluster analysis of the     gene expression levels was done. RESULTS: In the ischemic group, the expression     levels of c-fos, cyclin D1, and COX-2 were significantly higher at 2 h     postischemia, and those of bcl-2, bcl-xL, and HO-1 at 72 h. Based on the cluster     analysis, we statistically divided examined genes into three groups: group A,     early expression (COX-2, c-fos, and bcl-2); group B, s expression (c-jun, SOD-1,     bad, p53, SOD-2, bcl-xL, and bax); and group C, late expression (cyclin D1,     c-myc, and HO-1). CONCLUSION: We statistically classified the genes into three     groups after focal ischemia. The genes of the early- and late-expression groups     can be possible therapeutic targets for the treatment of cerebral ischemia.
