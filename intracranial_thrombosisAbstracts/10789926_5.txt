We report on a preterm infant with deep cerebral venous thrombosis, a rare condition in this age group. This premature infant had a gestational age of 33 weeks and normal development until day 18, when he presented with tonic seizures and a tense fontanelle. Ultrasound and computed tomography revealed bilateral haemorrhagic infarction of the whole region drained by the deep cerebral veins, including the periventricular white matter, thalamus and choroid plexus. The child was homozygous for the 4G allele of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) 4G/5G promoter polymorphism. CONCLUSION: In patients with bilateral cerebral infarction, thrombosis of the deep cerebral veins should be considered. In addition the role of prothrombotic risk factors, including PAI-1 4G/5G promoter polymorphism, in cerebral vein thrombosis should be clarified in a multicentre study.
