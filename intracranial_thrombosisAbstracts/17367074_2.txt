Partially thrombosed giant aneurysms that are located at the basilar artery (BA) bifurcation and are not amenable to clip application are among the most challenging lesions for neurosurgeons. They compress vital structures such as the brainstem and the thalamus, and the prognosis is extremely poor when they are left untreated. Although obliteration of the upper BA is a promising approach for these aneurysms, some lesions are refractory to this treatment, and effective additional strategies have not been clearly established. The authors report a case treated by placement of clips in the unilateral posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and posterior communicating artery as well as by superficial temporal artery-PCA bypass after unsuccessful upper BA obliteration. Complete thrombosis and dramatic shrinkage of the aneurysm were obtained.
