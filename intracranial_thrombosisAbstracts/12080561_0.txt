Behcet's disease is a chronic relapsing multisystem disorder of unknown etiology. Neurological complications are frequent, occurring in 10 to 49% of cases. We report 4 cases with Behcet's disease (3 females and 1 male) who had symptomatic intracranial hypertension due to cerebral venous sinus thrombosis within a mean delay of 2 years. The mean age at onset was 31 years and the mean age on referral was 39.5 years. The predominant manifestation in our series were headache, papilledema, seizures and pyramidal syndromes. CT Scan showed non specific abnormalities in all of them and the sinus venous thrombosis was confirmed by MRI in 3 cases. The authors emphasize on the importance of MRI with angio MRI for the diagnosis, the outcome and the evaluation of the cerebral venous thrombosis after treatment.
