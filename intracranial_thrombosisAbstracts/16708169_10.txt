BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To assess the feasibility and results of parent vessel stent reconstruction with balloon expandable and self-expandable stents in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. METHODS: In a total of 18 aneurysms balloon expandable (group A) and self expandable (group B) stents were used in 9 cases each. Stent implantation alone was used in 3 cases, and additional coil packing in the other 15. RESULTS: Stents were successfully deployed in 8 out of 9 in group A and in 9 out of 9 cases in group B. Nearly complete occlusion was achieved in all but one case. At 3 or 6 months stable occlusion was found in 4 group A and 2 group B patients, progressive thrombosis in 3 cases in both groups, and recanalisation in 1 case in group B. Late follow up at 1-4 years demonstrated one progressive thrombosis one recanalisation and 1 stable occlusion in 3 group A, and 2 stable occlusions in 2 group B. patients. Complications included one aneurysm perforation in group A, one in-stent thrombosis and a distal arterial perforation in group B and one groin hematoma in both groups. CONCLUSION: Stent reconstruction of intracranial arteries harbouring aneurysms is feasible and may result in aneurysm thrombosis without coil packing in some cases. Self expanding stents seem to provide a higher rate of success. Aggressive antiplatelet treatment increases the risk of hemorrhagic complications.
