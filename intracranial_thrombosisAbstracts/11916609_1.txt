A 63-year-old man presented with cachexia and confusion. He was found to have culture-negative endocarditis affecting his aortic valve. Despite treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and extensive investigation for an underlying cause, he suffered a large cerebral infarct and died. At post-mortem he was found to have non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis and a metastatic signet-ring carcinoma.
