A 13-year-old girl with preB-ALL was admitted because of headache during maintenance therapy including L-asparaginase. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed cerebral thrombosis. Coagulation studies showed decreased levels of fibrinogen, antithrombin-III and plasminogen. The patient was treated with antithrombin-III concentrates and fresh frozen plasma and recovered quickly. These findings suggest that coagulopathy induced by L-asparaginase is associated with the pathogenesis of cerebral thrombosis.
