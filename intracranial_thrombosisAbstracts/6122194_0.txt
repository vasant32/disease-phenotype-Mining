In our ongoing studies of the interrelationship between platelets and the vascular wall we found that an accurate estimate could be made of the clinical condition and more effective therapy prescribed when we monitored alterations in the plasma levels of TXB2. For this purpose we devised a radioimmunoassay with I125-TXB2-Tyramide. Patients with ischemic heart disorders, cerebral apoplexy, diabetes mellitus, Buerger's disease, Takayasu disease etc., all had statistically high levels of TXB2 as compared with healthy controls. In particular, patients with myocardial infarction, cerebral thrombosis and/or hemorrhage all revealed increases in levels of TXB2 and these levels increased in parallel with a worsening of the clinical condition, and there was always a re-increase in TXB2 level before a recurrence of an attack. As plasma TXB2 levels clearly reflect thrombogenic disorders, the assessment of these levels on a routine basis, enables a more accurate diagnosis, an indication of possible recurrences, and more effective chemotherapy and rehabilitation.
