AIM: To present a possible association between cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) and infection with Escherichia coli. METHODS: Four neonates with deep CVT occurring during an E. coli infection are presented. RESULTS: In these patients the thrombotic disease was found by Doppler ultrasonography. The thrombosis involved at least the sagittal sinus and the transverse sinus according to subsequent MRI scans. The E. coli strains did not produce verotoxin or haemolysin. Disseminated intravascular coagulation was not demonstrated. Three patients presented with seizures. At discharge, all of the patients had signs of neurological damage, but two of them have improved significantly since then. None of the patients has had recurrent (venous) thrombosis. CONCLUSION: E. coli infections in neonates may predispose to CVT, a finding that has clinical implications.
