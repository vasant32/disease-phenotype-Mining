Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) may present with a variety of symptoms and findings consisting of either only persistent headache, or slowly progressive stroke over several days, or even coma. CVT may develop in relation to hypercoagulable states. However, even after extensive investigation, a predisposing factor could not be identified in some cases. We report a case of CVT associated with heterozygous V Leiden mutation and sarcoidosis. Since most factor V gene heterozygous individuals do not exhibit clinical thrombotic events, the venous thrombosis of our patient suggests convergence of an inherited predisposition (heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation) with an acquired thrombogenic stimulus (sarcoidosis). Early diagnosis and treatment with anticoagulation is pivotal for a favorable outcome.
