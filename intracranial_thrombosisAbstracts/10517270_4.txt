This study aimed at developing a laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) device suitable for long-term cortical cerebral blood flow (cCBF) measurement in awake, freely moving rats. The device included a flow probe adapter for permanent fixation to the skull bone and a connector that held the flow probe in the adapter in exactly the same position during repeated cCBF recordings. With this LDF recording system, cCBF values were stable and unaltered in awake, freely moving rats up to 4 days after operation compared with initial recordings during anesthesia. Repeated cCBF measurements in rats after transient removal and reattachment of the flow probe revealed a coefficient of variation of 7.0-17.4%. The LDF recording system was applied to rats subjected to a photothrombotic ring stroke lesion. cCBF in the region-at-risk declined to 59-34-26-33% of baseline values (P < 0.01) at 1-2-24 48 h after irradiation with gradually restored cCBF values of 56-87% at 72-96 h post-irradiation (P < 0.01 vs. 24 h). Transcardial carbon black perfusion examination of the brains confirmed the sustained hypoperfusion in the region at risk up to 48 h post-ischemia followed by a consistently occurring late spontaneous reperfusion. In conclusion, a novel laser-Doppler cortical CBF recording system has been set up that allows stable long-term cortical CBF follow-up in awake, freely moving rats.
