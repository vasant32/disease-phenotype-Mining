A 50-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of dysarthria caused by a partially thrombosed vertebral artery (VA) aneurysm. Magnetic resonance imaging showed enhancement of the thickened wall and angiography detected staining. Stent-assisted coil embolization with protection of the parent artery patency was performed. The patient's clinical course was unremarkable and shrinking of the aneurysm was obtained. The stent-assisted coil embolization promoted intra-aneurysm flow disruption and stabilized the wall environment, suggesting another strategy for the treatment of partially thrombosed VA aneurysm.
