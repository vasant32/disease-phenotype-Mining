Posttraumatic cerebral infarction resulting from carotid or cerebral artery occlusion is rare. Traumatic dissection of the carotid artery is the most frequent cause of infarction, whereas posttraumatic thrombosis of the cerebral artery is very rare. The authors describe a case of posttraumatic thrombosis of the left middle cerebral artery. Early in the morning, a 16-year-old boy was found unconscious in the parking lot of a supermarket. He had received fist blows and kicks to the head, face, body, back, and hip during the night. Computed tomography 10 hours after the violence revealed a gross cerebral infarction in the area of the left middle cerebral artery. He died 9 days after the violence. The autopsy revealed a thrombosis in the left middle cerebral artery. Microscopically, granulation tissue in the intima and a rupture of the internal elastic lamina were observed near the beginning of the artery. It was concluded that the blows to the head and face caused a partial rupture in the arterial wall, leading to thrombosis and cerebral infarction.
