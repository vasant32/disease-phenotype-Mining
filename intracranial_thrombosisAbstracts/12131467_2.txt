A 21-year-old man developed an ipsilateral fourth nerve palsy, contralateral hemianopia, and contralateral hemisensory deficit as manifestations of a proximal right posterior cerebral artery aneurysm. This unusual constellation of signs reflects the involvement of the structures that run in the ambient cistern. The fourth nerve palsy and homonymous hemianopia are attributed to compression by the aneurysm. The hemisensory loss is ascribed to compromise of thalamoperforate arteries emanating from a thrombosed portion of the aneurysm.
