43 patients with cardiac myxoma had undergone surgical removal of the tumors under CPB 38 tumors were located in the left atrium, 5 in right atrium, and 1 in right ventricle respectively. The sites of attachment of the tumor stalk observed during operation were as follows: 34 left atrial myxomas were attached to the interatrial septum and 4 left atrial myxomas to the atrial wall. 5 right atrial myxomas were attached to the interatrial septum and 1 right ventricular myxoma to the ventricular wall. 1 patient with a right ventricular myxoma which had been removed one year ago appeared new one in the left atrium and the tumor was cut too. The diagnosis of cardiac myxoma was confirmed by 2D-echo-cardiography in all of our cases. Mitral valve replacement was done in 1 patient in this series. There was one death postoperatively. Besides these 43 cases, there were 9 patients who had not been operated upon, because of refusal of operation in 5, sudden death from cardiac arrest before operation in 2, coma from cerebral thrombosis in 1, and serious pulmonary tuberculosis in another one respectively.
