Cerebral venous thrombosis is a rare but dangerous condition. We present three cases of cerebral venous thrombosis. All three patients were females. CT scan was performed. One patient had a haemorrhagic infarct in the left temporal lobe, but CT scan was normal in the last two cases. MRI later revealed that cerebral venous thrombosis was the diagnosis in all three cases. MRI is the examination of choice when cerebral venous thrombosis is suspected. The patients were treated with heparin. One developed blindness due to optic nerve atrophy. One had discreet cognitive deficits, and the last patient had no neurological sequelae after she was discharged from the hospital.
