Using Low shear 30 rheometer, we measured the thixotropic parameters of blood from 30 patients suffering from cerebral thrombosis. The result showed that the yield stress (tau 0), non-Newtonian contribution of viscosity (eta s-mu) and viscosity of plasma (eta p) were significantly higher than those in the control group. Those patients were randomly divided into two groups. Each group included 15 patients. The patients in group 1 and group 2 were treated with poly-saccharide sulphate (PSS) and DX40 respectively by intravenous drip for 14 days. The results showed that tau 0, A, (eta s-mu) were significant decreased in group 1 after treatment, but no significantly change in the thixotropic parameters was found in group 2 after treatment. The total curative rate in group 1 was higher than that in group 2. These results suggest that the patients with cerebral thrombosis had evidently increased degree of RBC aggregation. PSS could decrease the aggregation of RBC more significantly than DX40 did. It was probably one of the reasons why the therapeutic effect of PSS on cerebral thrombosis was better than that of DX40.
