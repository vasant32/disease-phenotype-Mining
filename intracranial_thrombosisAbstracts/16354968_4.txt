OBJECTIVE: To describe the magnetic resonance imaging findings of an antenatal intracranial venous thrombosis. METHODS: Prenatal ultrasound (US) at 22 weeks' gestational age (GA) in a 27-year-old patient (G2 P1) revealed a nonspecific avascular echogenic mass above the cerebellum evaluated with MRI at 23 weeks' GA. RESULTS: With MRI an enlarged occipital pericerebral space with a layered ovoid mass at the torcular herophili was demonstrated and MRI characteristics suggested a subacute cloth. In follow-up, an important enlargement of the mass was noticed on US examinations. After multidisciplinary consult and parental consent, a prostaglandin induction was performed at 25 weeks' GA. The baby died immediately after birth. Pathology confirmed the diagnosis of a venous thrombosis at the torcular herophili with extension into the superior sagittal sinus. CONCLUSION: In our case, MRI findings were helpful in diagnosing an intracranial fetal venous thrombosis.
