Experiments on rats showed that Noopept improved retention and retrieval of conditioned passive avoidance response after phototrombosis of the prefrontal cortex (a procedure impairing retention of memory traces). The impairment of mnesic functions was accompanied by changes in integral biochemical indexes of the plasma determined by laser correlation spectroscopy. Treatment of behavioral disorders with Noopepet normalized biochemical indexes.
