A study of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) enzymes in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was carried out on 30 cases of acute cerebrovascular accident (CVA) to determine their role in precise diagnosis and prognosis of the cases. The CSF GOT and LDH activities were well correlated with the severity, mortality and peak and proper timing in relation to infarct, same is about serum GOT. A characteristic rise of GOT and LDH was observed in cerebral haemorrhage especially in fatal cases. However, in cerebral thrombosis and embolism specially in non-fatal cases, the enzyme change was not so marked. GOT and LDH enzyme pattern in CSF and serum may, therefore, serve as an early, relatively easy and widely available tool for differential diagnosis and prognosis of cases of acute CVA.
