OBJECTIVE: To assess whether thrombospondin-1 (THBS-1) gene G1678A polymorphism is associated with stroke. METHODS: Samples of venous blood were collected from 1634 patients with stroke, including cerebral thrombosis, lacunar cerebral infarction, and cerebral hemorrhage confirmed by CT or MRI, and sex-, and age-matched 1171 controls without cerebrovascular diseases. Genotypes were determined with polymerase chain reaction and allele-specific restriction enzyme analysis. RESULTS: The frequency of the THBS-1 gene 1678 AA genotype (0.503 vs. 0.441) was significantly higher in the cerebral thrombosis group than in the controls (P = 0.008). The frequency of the G allele (0.299 vs. 0.339) was significantly lower in the cerebral thrombosis group than in the controls (P = 0.009). No significant difference was seen in THBS-1 gene 1678 AA polymorphism either between the lacunar cerebral infarction group and the control group or between the cerebral hemorrhage group and the control group (all P > 0.05). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the AA genotype of THBS-1 gene G1678A carriers had a higher risk of cerebral thrombosis (OR: 1.4; 95% CI 1.083 - 1.693; P = 0.008) after adjustment for age, sex, SBP, DBP, BMI, smoking, TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C and Glu. CONCLUSION: AA genotypes in THBS-1 gene G1678A polymorphism may be a genetic risk factor of cerebral thrombosis in Chinese population.
