Laser Speckle Contrast Analysis (LASCA) has been used to image the development of an ischemic core following photochemically induced infarction in rats up to 1 h post-lesion. Using LASCA, we have been able to image a central ischemic core which had little or no perfusion surrounded by a penumbral region with reduced perfusion. In addition, we have shown the existence of a surrounding region of hyperemic tissue. A potential feature of this imaging approach is its capability to track cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes in the region within and outside the ischemic core besides demonstrating the real-time progression of the ischemic core into the penumbral region. We have demonstrated the continuous disruption of CBF to the ischemic core that eventually affected the blood supply to the surrounding regions. The penumbral flow is shown to exhibit a sudden increase post-ischemic induction followed by a slow decline to the final baseline level. Interestingly, we observed an interaction (P < 0.03) between penumbral flow peak and the time effects of increase in pixel area from the infarct region to the surrounding penumbral region. Using a paired-sample t test, we observed that the mean pixel area was larger for the infarct region than for the penumbral region (P < 0.004) during the time interval between the induction of ischemia and the time point of peak flow in the penumbral region.
