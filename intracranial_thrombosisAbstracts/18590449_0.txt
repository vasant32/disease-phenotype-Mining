Multidetector CT has become widely available and with it the ability to rapidly create detailed reformatted images. Multiplanar images can be created depicting the anatomy in planes other than the traditional axial plane, using isotropic to near-isotropic data. It is important for both clinicians and radiologists to be aware of this capability in order to take advantage of such images. To illustrate the value of this type of imaging, the authors present a case of a third ventricular clot that migrated into the cerebral aqueduct exacerbating hydrocephalus.
