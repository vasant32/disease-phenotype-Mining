In this study, we adapted the original rat photothrombosis model of Watson et al. (Ann Neurol 17 (1985) 497) for use in mice by refining the application route of the dye, illumination and stereotactic parameters. After intraperitoneal injection of the photosensitive dye Rose bengal, subsequent focal illumination of the brain with a cold light source through the intact skull led to focal cortical infarcts of reproducible size, location and geometry. Cresyl violet histology displayed well-demarcated infarcts that matured with time in a predictable manner. Microglial responses, as assessed by immunocytochemistry, against F4/80 and CD11b antigens were rapid and complete at the infarct site, but delayed and incomplete in degenerating fiber tracts and ipsilateral thalamic nuclei. In contrast to the rat, where the expression of CD4 and CD8 antigens discriminate distinct subpopulations of lesion-associated phagocytes, the expression of both markers was low to absent in the mouse model. In both rats and mice, cerebral photothrombosis shares essential inflammatory responses with focal ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion. It may provide a useful model to study functional aspects of lesion-associated and remote molecular responses in transgenic mice.
