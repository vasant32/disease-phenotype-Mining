OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcome of patients with most severe cerebral venous and dural sinus thrombosis (CVT) after decompressive craniectomy. Indications and techniques for decompressive craniectomy and intensive care regimen are discussed. METHODS: Between 2000 and 2004 15 patients with CVT and intracerebral hemorrhage were treated at the Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital Zurich. Among them, four patients with the most severe illness course were treated with decompressive craniectomy. Indications for decompressive craniectomy were deterioration of level of consciousness with CT signs of space occupying brain edema, venous infarction and congestional bleeding with mass effect, midline shift and obliteration of the basal cisterns. RESULTS: Among 15 patients with CVT and intraparenchymatous hemorrhage four patients were treated with decompressive craniectomy. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) immediately before the operation was in mean 10.2 (range 6 to 13). No patient showed signs of unilateral or bilateral third nerve palsy before surgery. No surgical complications were observed. All four patients who underwent decompressive craniectomy recovered with favourable functional outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale; GOS 4 and 5). Anticoagulation therapy with heparin was reconvened 12 hours postoperatively with half dosage and 12 hours later with full dosage. No enlargement of existing intraparenchymatous hematoma or other intracranial bleeding complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Favorable functional outcome in selected patients with most severe courses of CVT can be achieved after decompressive craniectomy. Postoperative anticoagulation therapy with full dose heparin 24 hours after craniotomy seems to be safe. Precise indications and techniques for combined surgical decompression and thrombectomy deserve to be evaluated in future studies.
