Many important questions regarding pathophysiology and treatment of cerebral sinovenous thrombosis need clarification and may depend on further knowledge on the etiology, site, extension and recanalization of the thrombosis. We studied these variables in a cohort of children and adolescents from seven Portuguese Centers. We conclude from our results that the deep venous system and the superior longitudinal sinus are less frequently affected with thrombosis but have a greater potential for serious neurologic disease and for major sequelae. Non-recanalization, at least in the long term, is not an adverse prognostic factor. Extensive propagation of the thrombus from the initial site of origin seems to be common. The early identification of risk factors and their treatment coupled with an aggressive attitude towards diagnosis and treatment for thrombosis involving the deep venous system would be warranted.
