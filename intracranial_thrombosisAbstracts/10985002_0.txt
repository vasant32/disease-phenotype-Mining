We report a case of severe perinatal asphyxia with both cerebral venous thrombosis and adrenal hemorrhage who survived with severe sequela including multicystic encephalomalasia, acquired microcephaly and blindness. Hematological investigations showed normal levels of anticardiolipin antibodies, protein C and S levels and activity, antithrombin III levels. Factor V Leiden mutation was negative. The adrenal hemorrhage resolved within three months with glucocorticoid therapy, the cerebral venous thrombosis resolved within two months without treatment. The literature on neonatal cerebral venous thrombosis is also reviewed.
