The aim of the study was investigation of nonspecific inflammation markers in atherosclerotic injury of major arteries of the head (MAH). A complex study, including duplex ultrasonography, CT, measurement of cholesterol and its fractions, has been conducted in 85 patients with atherothrombotic (72 patients) and lacunar (23 patients) stroke. The ability of leucocytes' culture to accumulate and secrete cholesterol in vitro was studied as a nonspecific inflammatory marker of lesion of atherosclerotic MAH. A high level of this index was characteristic of atherothrombotic type of stroke comparing to lacunar stroke and the control group. Furthermore, high levels of this index correlated with severity of atherosclerotic injury of MAH, in particular with plaques. The dynamics of the index after 24-day therapy by statins (vasilip) is presented. We suppose that the protective influence of statins in patients after ischemic stroke may be caused by the effects on the level of immune competent cells including reducing leucocytes ability to accumulate and secrete protein-lipid complexes.
