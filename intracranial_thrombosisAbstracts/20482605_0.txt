 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The A>G polymorphism at position 19911 of the prothrombin gene is associated with a mildly increased risk of venous thromboembolism, alone or in association with such common thrombophilia mutations as factor V Leiden and prothrombin 20210 GA. Its role in cerebral sinus-venous thrombosis (CSVT) is not known. METHODS: The presence of prothrombin 19911 A>G was investigated in a case–control study of 107 patients with cerebral thrombosis and factor V Leiden (n = 25), prothrombin 20210 GA (n = 47), without known thrombophilia (n = 35) and 842 healthy individuals with the corresponding coagulation profile. RESULTS: Prothrombin 19911 A>G did not increase the risk of CSVT in carriers of factor V Leiden (adjusted odds ratio 1.6, 95%CI 0.6–4.7), prothrombin 20210 GA (odds ratio 1.1, 95%CI 0.6–2.2), nor in patients without known thrombophilia (odds ratio 1.3, 95%CI 0.5–3.1). CONCLUSIONS: Prothrombin 19911 A>G polymorphism does not appear to be a risk factor for CSVT, alone or in association with factor V Leiden or prothrombin 20210GA.
