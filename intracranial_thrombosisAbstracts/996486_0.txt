It is increasingly accepted that oral contraceptives foster thromboembolic diseases (chiefly cerebral ictus) by affecting hemostatic mechanisms causing intimal proliferation. Since 1968 the antithrombotic activity of Aspirin has been under study, and Aspirin has proven effective in preventing arterial thrombosis. Therefore, if oral contraceptives foster arterial thrombosis, Aspirin may prevent cerebral thrombosis in women on oral contraceptives. Six women with cerebral ictus (the  incidence is 10 times higher than in men of the same age and in women not on oral contraceptives) have undergone chest X-ray and ECG. Two underwent pulmonary scintigraphy and 1 pulmonary arteriography. They did not exhibit signs of thrombosis in pulmonary veins or in the heart, a fact which suggested primary cerebral thrombosis. This was verified by cerebral arteriography. Accordingly, Aspirin in a dose not exceeding 1 g per day may be effective in the prevention of ictus. In vizw of the well known side effects of Aspirin, this hypothesis would need to be tested in a prospective study.
