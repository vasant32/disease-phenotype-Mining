OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of ginkgolides injection on experimental cerebral ischemia and its related mechanism of action. METHOD: The middle cerebral artery occlusion (MACO) model was induced by the FeCl3-occluding method to explore the protective effects of ginkgolides injection on the score of neurological deficits, the rate of cerebral infarction and the histomorphology of cerbral ischemia in rats. Thrombosis formation in vivo was induced by adrenaline-collagen in mice to explore the antithrombotic effect. Platelet aggregation was induced by ADP and hemorrheological parameters with hyper-viscosity by dextran T-500 were used to explore the effects of antiplatelet aggregation and decreasing viscosity of blood. RESULT: Ginkgolides injection could markedly decrease the infarct size and behavior deficits score, inhibit the thrombus formation in mice, decrease blood viscosity and ameliorate hemorrheological parameters in rat. CONCLUSION: Ginkgolides injection has the protective effects on focal cerebral ischemia, and its mechanism may be relative to its inhibition of platelet-dependent thrombosis and amelioration of hemarheological partments.
