We report a partially thrombosed giant of the aneurysm basilar artery with prominent mass effect, diagnosed in an 11 year-old child who presented with neurological deficits due to brain stem compression. After the patent portion of the aneurysm was embolised with Guglielmi detachable coils, remarkable clinical improvement occurred. Angiography demonstrated complete occlusion of the aneurysm and MRI revealed dramatic shrinkage of the aneurysm at 6-month and 1-year follow-up.
