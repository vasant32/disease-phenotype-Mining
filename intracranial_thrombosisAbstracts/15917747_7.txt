The aim of our study was to visualize developing vessel occlusion in focal cerebral ischemia in vivo. Cortical photothrombosis (PT) was induced in rats, which in addition received superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) particles intravenously. When SPIO particles were applied simultaneously during illumination of the brain for induction of PT, animals showed a markedly hypointense cortical lesion on T2-weighted (T2-w) magnetic-resonance images (MRI). At 3 h after PT, this hypointense area was surrounded by a small hyperintense rim. At 48 h after PT the hyperintense rim had further extended, whereas the hypointense lesion core did not change in size or signal. On histological sections areas of signal loss on T2-w MRI corresponded to local accumulation of iron particles, which were trapped within vessel thrombi. When SPIO particles were applied at 2 h after PT, the lesion appeared hyperintense on T2-w MRI, but was surrounded by a small hypointense rim indicating ongoing vessel occlusion at its outer margins. In contrast, delayed SPIO application at 24 h after completion of PT produced a merely hyperintense cortical lesion on T2-w MRI. Correspondingly, no iron deposits were seen on tissue sections. In conclusion, early SPIO-enhanced MRI provides a reliable in vivo tool to delineate areas of developing vessel occlusion in experimental cerebral ischemia and identifies vessel thrombosis as one mechanism of secondary infarct growth in the PT paradigm. This new imaging technique may aid to evaluate antithrombotic treatment strategies in the future.
