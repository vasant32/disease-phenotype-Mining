Transient atrioventricular (1st-degree and 2nd-degree (type II) block, coronary node rhythm, dissociation) and intraventricular (left anterior hemiblock) disturbance were noted in a 67-yr-old man with acute cerebral thrombosis. It is suggested that one of more of the following factors were responsible from time to time for these unusual ECG signs: disturbance of neurovegetative regulation with predominant vagal hypertonus, circulation deficiencies in the conduction tissue due to decreased cardiac output, and histological lesion of specific tissue.
