PURPOSE: The unenhanced signs of basilar thrombosis at computed tomography (CT) is the hyperdense visualization of the basilar artery due to intravascular thrombosis. In patients who are clinically asymptomatic, hyperdense visualization of the basilar artery can be observed, if scanned with a double helical CT. Purpose of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic significance of these changes seen at double-helical CT. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Ten patients patients underwent double-helical CT of a portion of the base of the skull. In each case, 5-mm and 10-mm fused slices were obtained. The patency of the visualized vessels was then documented using contrast-enhanced images. RESULTS: The differences in attenuation between the 5-mm and 10-mm fused slices obtained at native examinations were a median 11 HU. Subsequent contrast enhanced studies documented patency of the examined vessels. CONCLUSION: The present data show that the hyperdense basilar artery as a sign of thrombotic occlusion is not valid when thin, fused slices are obtained at double-helical CT.
