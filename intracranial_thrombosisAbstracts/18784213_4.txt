BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Thromboembolism is a recognized complication occurring during endovascular coil embolization of intracranial aneurysms. Recently, there has been much interest in glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors to treat such complications, but the evidence is limited. We reviewed our use of one such agent, abciximab, which we commonly administer and believe to be a safe and suitable rescue agent in this setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed cases in which abciximab was administered in our institution between 2001 and 2007. Clinical outcome was assessed by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 6 months. Good outcome was defined as no significant clinical sequelae compared with baseline status or clinical improvement (mRS < 2). Poor outcome was defined as no resolution of a new clinical deficit that developed postprocedure at 6 months (mRS > 2). Angiographic appearance of thromboembolic phenomena and posttreatment outcome was assessed with the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) scale. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were included, with good outcome observed in 30 (79%) and poor outcome in 8 (21%) patients. Angiographic improvement based on TIMI scoring was seen in 24 (63%) patients, and no improvement was seen in 14 (37%). In 4 patients (11%), good outcome was obtained at 6 months despite no angiographic improvement on TIMI. No cases of intracranial rebleed or additional neurologic deficit following administration of abciximab were encountered. CONCLUSION: In this small retrospective series, abciximab was safe and effective when used as a rescue agent for thromboembolic complications encountered during coiling of intracerebral aneurysms.
