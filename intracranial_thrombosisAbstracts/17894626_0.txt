BACKGROUND: Cerebral sino-venous thrombosis (CVT) is commonly treated with anticoagulant therapy. There are reports of response to endovascular thrombolysis with or without mechanical aspiration in patients with clinical deterioration. CASE: We present a 29-year-old man with acute onset of severe headache, found to have extensive CVT by magnetic resonance venography (MRV). His atypical presentation led to cerebral angiography that was complicated by global aphasia and right hemiparesis from left middle cerebral artery distribution ischemia. He received intravenous rt-PA (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) within an hour of the procedure followed, 24 hours later, by intravenous heparin infusion with significant clinical improvement. The headache severity and CVT, on follow-up MRV, resolved significantly within 2 days. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate clinical and neuroimaging response to systemic rt-PA in CVT. Thrombolysis may have a role in CVT management with an extended therapeutic window.
