Changes in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) are well established in acute ischemic stroke of arterial origin. However, ADC behaviour and its prognostic significance in cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) are not fully understood. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) findings in a 34-year old woman with deep cerebral venous thrombosis are described. Recent literature concerning DWI and cerebral venous thrombosis is also reviewed. A MRI performed within 7 hours from onset revealed hyperintensities in deep grey matter bilaterally (FLAIR/T2), without changes in ADC maps, suggesting vasogenic edema. After anticoagulation a new MRA disclosed complete recanalization of venous thrombosis. Despite her good clinical outcome the MRI showed hemorrhagic lesions suggesting venous infarct. Lesions detected in acute CVT with DWI may have normal ADC values. There is no good correlation between the acute ADC values and clinical and radiological evolution. The prognostic value of ADC in the acute phase of CVT remains unsettled.
