Severe cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a rare cerebrovascular condition which in the more severe cases warrants intensive care treatment. While the outcome in the majority of uncomplicated CVT cases is good, it may be fatal in more affected patients. We provide long-term functional and quality of life (QOL) outcome data in the form of a retrospective analysis of 10 patients admitted to a neurological ICU with severe CVT. Outcome measures used were the modified Rankin Scale, the 36-item Short Form Health Survey, and the Psychological General Well-Being index. The mortality rate was 50% but 4 out 5 survivors had a good functional outcome with normal QOL despite a very severe clinical course. This finding justifies extensive life-sustaining therapy as the prognosis even of severe cases may be good if the acute phase is survived.
