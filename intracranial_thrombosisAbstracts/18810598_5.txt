Ruptured vertebrobasilar dissecting aneurysm is usually treated surgically because rebleeding negatively affects outcome. However, the risk of rebleeding decreases markedly once several hours have passed from the initial bleeding. Moreover, surgery-related complications are not rare. We describe seven patients with ruptured vertebrobasilar dissecting aneurysm. To prevent rebleeding during the acute stage, we treated all seven patients conservatively with fentanyl instead of emergency surgery. During the follow-up period (mean 20 months), no patient suffered rebleeding. Conservative treatment with fentanyl administration may be a good option for management of ruptured vertebrobasilar dissecting aneurysm during the acute stage.
