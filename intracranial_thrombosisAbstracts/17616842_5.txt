OBJECTIVE: This paper reports the complications of transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas in a series of 1240 consecutive patients operated at our Institute between 1990 and 2004 (first operations) and indicate the clinical characteristics of patients which affected surgical morbidity and mortality. METHODS: According to tumour type, there were 420 (33.9%) non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFPA), 349 (28.1%) GH-secreting, 288 (23.2%) ACTH-secreting, 155 (12.5%) prolactin (PRL)-secreting, and 28 (2.3%) TSH-secreting adenomas. The mean age of patients was 43.7 +/- 0.4 yr and 122 patients (9.9%) were 65 yr or older; the female/male ratio was 1.5/1. There were 370 (29.8%) microadenomas and 870 (70.2%) macroadenomas of which 54 (4.4%) were giant adenomas. RESULTS: The series mortality was 0.2%, the medical morbidity 1.9%, and the surgical morbidity 3.5%. Medical complications were significantly more frequent in patients older than 65 yr (4.9 vs. 1.4%; p = 0.009) and in patients with giant adenomas (5.6 vs. 1.6%; p = 0.03). Multivariate analysis showed that both variables were independently associated with a higher morbidity rate. The surgical morbidity was increased in giant adenomas (15 vs. 3%; p = 0.0001), in NFPA (6.2 vs. 2.1% in secreting adenomas; p = 0.0002) and in patients older than 65 yr (6.6 vs. 3.1%; p = 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that only giant size was independently associated with an increased surgical morbidity rate. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, the size of the adenoma was a risk factor for medical and surgery related complications and age over 65 yr for medical complications alone.
