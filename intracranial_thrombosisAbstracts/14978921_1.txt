We compared the findings of multislice computed tomography (MSCT) with angiography after stenting for supraaortic arteries. Twelve cases that underwent both MSCT and angiography were evaluated. In 4 cases, stenotic findings were shown by neither MSCT nor angiography. Lumen diameters measured by MSCT tended to be shorter than those measured by angiography. In-stent stenosis evaluated by MSCT was found in 6 cases, and all of them revealed low density areas in the inner stent lumen. In 4 of them, intimal hyperplasia was indicated by angiography, but in 2 of them, unexpectedly, no stenotic findings were found by angiography. In one case, using MSCT the part two stents partially lying over one another revealed severe artifact in the inner stent lumen, but no stenosis was found by angiography. In 2 cases, unevenly spread extra-stent space was found, but that was not revealed by angiography. We conclude that MSCT is useful to evaluate lumen diameter, in-stent intimal hyperplasia, in-stent thrombus, and extra-stent space.
