Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis caused by paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is uncommon. Our case is a 44-year-old woman who presented with a 2 day history of headaches, nausea, and seizures followed by a Todd`s paresis; she had been diagnosed as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria for 4 years. A magnetic resonance venography revealed extensive thrombosis of the cerebral venous sinus. She received antithrombotic treatment with a good outcome. We highlight paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria as the reason for the cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. The treatment of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis caused by paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria should be individualized.
