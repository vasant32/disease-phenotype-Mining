 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intracranial thrombus is a principal feature in most ischemic stroke, and thrombus location and size may correlate with outcome and response to thrombolytic therapy. EP-2104R is a fibrin-specific molecular MR agent that has previously been shown to enhance extracranial and venous sinus thrombi in animal models and, recently, in clinical trials. In this study, we examined whether this fibrin-specific MR probe could noninvasively characterize intracranial arterial thrombi. METHODS: Embolic stroke was induced in adult rats by occlusion of the right internal carotid artery with an aged thrombus. We used diffusion-weighted imaging, time of flight angiography, and high-resolution 3-dimensional T1-weighted MRI at 4.7 T before and after use of contrast agents EP-2104R (n=6) and gadopentetate dimeglumine (n=5). RESULTS: In all animals, MR angiography revealed a flow deficit and diffusion-weighted imaging showed hyperintensity consistent with ischemia. Using EP-2104R-enhanced MRI, we saw occlusive thrombi and vessel wall enhancement in all 6 animals with high contrast to noise relative to blood, whereas gadopentetate dimeglumine-injected animals showed no occlusive thrombus or vessel wall enhancement. The concentration of gadolinium in the thrombus after EP-2104R was 18 times that in the blood pool. CONCLUSIONS: EP-2104R-enhanced MRI successfully identifies intracranial thrombus in a rat embolic stroke model.
