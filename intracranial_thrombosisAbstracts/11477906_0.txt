OBJECTIVE: To analyse the relationship between lipometabolic disorder in stroke with TCM Syndrome Differentiation and Typing. METHODS: The serum lipid, lipoprotein and apo-lipoprotein level of TCM treated group (142 cases) and control group (100 cases) were determined. The patients were subdivided into three Type-groups according to TCM Syndrome Differentiation: Phlegm-Dampness Stagnation (PDS), Yin Deficiency with Yang Hyperactivity (YDYH) and Qi Deficiency with Blood Stasis (QDBS) group. RESULTS: The results showed that the level of TC, TG, HDL, LDL, apoA1, apoB and apoA1/apoB were significantly different in PDS and QDBS as compared with control group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, respectively), while lipometabolic disorder of PDS was most serious in TCM Syndrome Differentiation of stroke. The level of TG, apoA1/apoB were significantly different in YDYH in comparing with control group (P < 0.05). While the level of TC, HDL, LDL and apoB were insignificantly different than those of control group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that lipometabolic disorder of stroke were correlated with Syndrome Differentiation of TCM. Stroke with PDS and QSBS should give removing Phlegm-Dampness, dredging Meridian and removing blood stasis treatment besides routine treatment.
