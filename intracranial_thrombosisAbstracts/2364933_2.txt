The causes, risk factors and outcome of cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) in 150 patients admitted to Tikur Anbessa Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, between 1983 and 1985 were studied. Cerebral thrombosis was the commonest cause of CVA (50.6%), followed by cerebral haemorrhage (24%) and cerebral embolism (15%). The single most important risk factor for CVA was hypertension. Mortality was highest with cerebral haemorrhage (89.4%) and lowest with cerebral embolism (13%). An important measure which could reduce the incidence of CVA is the vigorous and sustained control of hypertension.
