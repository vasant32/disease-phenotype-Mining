BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies on the hyperdense middle cerebral artery (MCA) sign were conducted using > or =5-mm thickness noncontrast-computed tomography (NCT). The purpose of this study was to compare thin-section NCT with 5-mm NCT in the detection of thrombus in acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: Enrolled were consecutive 51 patients with acute infarction in the anterior or MCA territory. All patients underwent both 5-mm NCT and either 1.25- or 1-mm thin-section helical NCT within 6 hours of symptom onset. Patients were assigned to either the single or multisegmental occlusion group, depending on the thrombus extent on thin-section NCT. Thin-section NCT and 5-mm NCT were compared in the detection of thrombi. RESULTS: Thrombi were identified in 45 patients (88%) on thin-section NCT and 16 on 5-mm NCT (31%; P<0.001). No occlusion was seen in 6 patients. Both sensitivity and specificity of thin-section NCT in detection of thrombus were 100%. CONCLUSIONS: Acute thrombus can be detected with higher sensitivity on thin-section NCT than on 5-mm NCT, and its extent is more accurately determined on thin-section NCT.
