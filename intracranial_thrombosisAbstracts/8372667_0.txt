Between August 1984 and September 1990, 13 children with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) were treated with ALL high-risk protocol (5 with TCLSG 842 regimen and 8 with TPOG 882B protocol) at Taichung Veterans General Hospital. Diagnosis of NHL was confirmed by histology. Nine had lymphoblastic lymphoma, three had histiocytic lymphoma and one had small non-cleaved cell lymphoma, according to the Rappaport classification. After thorough clinical evaluation eight children were NHL stage IV; four were stage III; and one was stage II. All these children had received chemotherapy as acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) high-risk protocol for a total of three years, including central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis. Of the 13 patients, 9 (69.2%) gained complete remission. Over-all survival rate was 46.2%, with a median interval of 36 months. The complete remission rate and survival rate for the nine children with lymphoblastic lymphoma was better at 77.7% & 66.6% respectively. Within the nonresponsive group, two failed to remit because of early withdrawal from the protocol; the other two patients were refractory to treatment. Relapse was noted in one patient. As to the side effects, neutropenic fever was the most common problem encountered (9 occurrences in 13 patients). Other major complications included severe mucositis, massive GI bleeding, intracranial thrombosis induced by l-asparaginase and tumor lysis syndrome. Childhood NHL is often of diffuse types in pathology, and most affected children have advanced diseases at diagnosis. Choosing an optimal treatment protocol is important for good treatment results.
