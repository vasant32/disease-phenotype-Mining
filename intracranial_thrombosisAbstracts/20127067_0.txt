Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a rare cause of tinnitus and headache. We report the case history, clinical presentation, physical examination, imaging studies, therapy, course and outcome of a young patient with CVT. In addition, we present another case with similar findings and varying causes, which could lead to misdiagnoses. With prompt diagnosis and therapy of CVT, full recovery is possible.
