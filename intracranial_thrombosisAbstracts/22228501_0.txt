The effects of hesperidin, glucosyl hesperidin (G-hesperidin), a water-soluble derivative of hesperidin, and naringin on blood pressure and cerebral thrombosis were investigated using stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). Hesperidin, G-hesperidin and naringin were mixed with diet and fed to the animals for 4 weeks. No effect was evident on body weight, but the supplements significantly suppressed the age related increase in blood pressure. Thrombotic tendency, as assessed using a He-Ne laser technique in the cerebral blood vessels, was significantly decreased in the treated animals compared with the control animals. Measurements of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) demonstrated that the supplements had strong antioxidant activity. Furthermore, these supplements significantly increased the production of nitric oxide (NO) metabolites in urine measured with Griess reagent. Vasodilation induced by acetylcholine-mediated NO production in the endothelium was assessed using thoracic aortic ring preparations and indicated that endothelial function was significantly improved by the administration of these supplements. These findings suggest that the strong antioxidant properties of hesperidin, G-hesperidin and naringin could modulate the inactivation of NO and protect endothelial function from reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this manner, the flavonoids could contribute beneficial effects on the mechanisms of hypertension and thrombosis by increasing the bioavailability of NO.
