A new slow-moving variant of the complement factor B, named BF S075, was found in a Japanese patient with cerebral thrombosis and urticaria. The variant was inherited in a codominant manner. The protein concentration and functional hemolytic activity of the complement factor B in the patient's serum were within normal limits. The BF S075 is the fourth rare BF variant found in the Japanese population.
