Morphology of the corpus callosum (CC) at the mid-sagittal level has been a target of extensive studies. However, the lack of internal structures and its polymorphism make it a challenging task to quantitatively analyze shape differences among subjects. In this paper, diffusion tensor Imaging (DTI) and tract tracing technique were applied to incorporate cortical connectivity information to the morphological study. The CC was parcellated into six major subdivisions based on trajectories to different cortical areas. This subdivision was performed for eight normal subjects and one stroke patient. The parcellated CCs of the normal subjects were normalized for morphological analysis. When comparing the stroke patient to the normal population, we detected significant atrophy in the motor and sensory areas of the patient CC, in line with the clinical deficits. This approach provides a new tool to investigate callosal morphology and functional relationships.
