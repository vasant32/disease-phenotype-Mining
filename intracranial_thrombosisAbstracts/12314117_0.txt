According to a preliminary World Health Organization (WHO) survey aimed at correlating smoking and young age groups, mid-teenage girls smoked as much as, or more than, boys for the 1st time ever in 14 countries.  The rise in female smoking, WHO officials say, in combination with oral contraceptives -- now used more thean ever before -- increases the risk later in life of circulatory disorders, such as cerebral thrombosis and hemorrhage, as well as coronary heart diseases.  Although there is world-wide recognition of the need to counter the rise in smoking among youth, "it is surprising to note that only a handful of countries have collected information on the prevalence of smoking in youth," WHO says.  It is suggested that health authorities -- particularly in the 3rd world -- compile data on base anti-smoking campaigns.
