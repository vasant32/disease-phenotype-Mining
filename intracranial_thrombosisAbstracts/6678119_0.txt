A total of 1310 cases of cerebrovascular disease with neurological deficit admitted for rehabilitation at the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore, during the past 10 years (1973 to 1982) are collected and analysed. Those cases due to head injury or brain tumours are excluded from this study. 763 (58.24%) were males and 547 (41.76%) were females. 48.24% were above the age of 60, and there was almost an equal distribution of left and right hemiplegics (642 left hemiplegics and 615 right hemiplegics), with 53 having bilateral stroke. 77.25% of the cases were caused by cerebral thrombosis. 808 (61.68%) cases had hypertension, and 298 (22.75%) cases suffered from diabetes mellitus. After rehabilitation, 89.01% of the cases were ambulant with or without aids or appliances, and 91.91% were either fully independent or partially independent in self-care activities. 95.8% of the patients stayed less than three months in hospital, and 48.09% were able to go home within the first month of hospitalisation. Out of 668 cases who were working before the onset of stroke, 338 (50.60%) could return to gainful employment after their discharge from the hospital.
