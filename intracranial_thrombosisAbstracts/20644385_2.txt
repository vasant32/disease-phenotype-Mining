 OBJECTIVE: We report a unique case of a dissecting thrombosed left anterior choroidal aneurysm. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: The aneurysm was diagnosed in a pediatric patient who presented with right-sided hemiparesis. Computed tomography, computed tomographic angiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and conventional angiography studies were helpful in diagnosing the aneurysm in this patient. Imaging was consistent with an acute infarct in the left globus pallidus. INTERVENTION: An orbitozygomatic craniotomy was performed for surgical clipping of the aneurysm. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the unique appearance of a dissecting aneurysm in the anterior choroidal artery and stresses the importance of recognizing atypical presentations of complex aneurysms in the pediatric population.
