Reported are three patients with ictal monoparesis of an arm. In the hemisphere contralateral to the monoparesis, ictal and interictal epileptiform discharges were observed in the centroparietal area, and a well-circumscribed lesion was commonly present in the primary arm somatosensory area (SI). In the presence of an SI lesion, the epileptic activity at the sensorimotor area could lead to selective or predominant activation of the inhibitory motor system.
