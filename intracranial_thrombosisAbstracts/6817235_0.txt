In order to investigate the factor VIII complex trend in atherosclerosis, 96 patients suffering from atherosclerosis, divided in 6 groups (angina pectoris, previous myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attacks, previous cerebral thrombosis, diabetes without symptoms of vascular injury and diabetes with vascular complications), were studied and compared to a control group of normal subjects. Plasma levels of Factor VII Coagulant (VIII C), Factor VIII-Related von Willebrand Factor (VIII-RWF) and Factor VIII-related Antigen (VIII ARg) were measured in all subjects. A significant rise of VIII RAg was noticed in all groups of patients as compared to the control group: this increase appears to be related to the severity of vascular injury. A significant rise of VIII RWF, parallel to the VIII RAg increase, was also noticed in all groups. Besides, all groups of patients showed a significant and uniform increase of VIII C. The average ratio of VIII RAg/VIII C was raised in all groups, except diabetics without complications; but the increase was statistically significant only in those patients with a heavier vascular injury which is related to the marked rise of VIII RAg in such clinical situations. The findings of this study are discussed in relation to the literature data. The significance of the determination of VIII RAg/VIII C ratio and of the VIII RAg assay as methods for monitoring the severity of the vascular injury in atherosclerosis are also discussed.
