We reported a 62-year-old male with cerebral thrombosis presenting global aphasia without hemiparesis. The patient had an episode of aphasia 15 years ago, but recovered within 6 months. This time he had transient right sided mild hemiparesis, then he became aphasia next morning. When we examined at day 10 and day 15, his consciousness was clear, nothing he could speech, he could not understand or repeat. We diagnosed him global aphasia, but he had no hemiparesis except for right facial mild paresis and was able to walk. CT scan showed low density area in left and right posterior, left anterior watershed and left terminal zone. Cerebral angiography disclosed thrombotic occlusion of main trunk of left middle cerebral artery, and ambient segment of right posterior cerebral artery. Global aphasia without hemiparesis has been said a sign of embolic encephalopathy. This case was considered a very rare case, because he revealed global aphasia without hemiparesis by thrombotic occlusion.
