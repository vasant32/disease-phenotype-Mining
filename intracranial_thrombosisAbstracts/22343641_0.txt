 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fibrin clot formation is important in acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We investigated plasma fibrin clot characteristics in acute ICH compared with acute ischemic stroke (IS) and nonstroke conditions. METHODS: In the 3 studied groups, we analyzed plasma fibrin clot phenotype and its association with clinical stroke presentation. RESULTS: Compared with controls, in patients with acute strokes, fibrin clots presented with lower clot permeability, longer lysis time, and higher maximum clot absorbance (for all, P<0.001). In ICH patients compared with IS patients, only lysis time was shorter by 13% (P<0.001). In the ICH group, neurological deficit correlated significantly (P<0.05) with clot compaction, and the rate of increase in d-dimers released from clots, whereas initial hematoma volume correlated with lag phase of fibrin formation on turbidimetry and compaction (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In both types of acute strokes, fibrin clot properties are altered: denser fibrin clots are relatively resistant to lysis. In acute ICH, fibrin clots are more susceptible to tissue plasminogen activator-mediated lysis compared with in IS, which might affect ICH pathogenesis.
