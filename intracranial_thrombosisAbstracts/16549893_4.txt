Over a 12-year period, 112 consecutive children with arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) and 38 children with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) were prospectively recruited at a single pediatric center in Argentina. One or more underlying clinical conditions were identified in most patients (55%) with AIS and in almost all patients with CVT. Inherited and/or acquired prothrombotic disorders were detected in 17% of the patients with AIS and in 34% of the children with CVT. No associations between factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A mutation and children with AIS or CVT were found. Antithrombotic agents (i.e., aspirin, low-molecular-weight heparin and acenocoumarol) were administered without major hemorrhagic complications. In our cohorts, mortality due to the thrombotic episode was 1.8% in children with AIS. No child with CVT died from his or her thrombotic episodes. Three children (3.2%) and 1 adolescent (1.1%) with AIS had thrombotic progression and recurrence, respectively. A large percentage of children with AIS (68%) and CVT (32%) have had some kind of sequels that caused serious disability in approximately half the cases.
