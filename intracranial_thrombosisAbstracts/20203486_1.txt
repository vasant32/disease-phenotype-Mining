BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Brain imaging of patients with acute cerebral venous thrombosis often shows parenchymal hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic lesions. The clinical relevance of nonhemorrhagic lesions is poorly known. METHOD: In the International Study on Cerebral Vein and Dural Sinus Thrombosis cohort, demographic, clinical, risk factor, prognosis and imaging findings were compared between patients with parenchymal nonhemorrhagic lesions and no hemorrhagic lesions (NHL) and (1) patients with parenchymal hemorrhagic lesions (HL) and (2) patients without brain lesions. Predictors of prognosis at the end of follow-up in the NHL group were analyzed by bivariate and Cox regression methods. RESULTS: We identified 147 patients (23.6%) with NHL. When compared to patients without brain lesions (n = 309), those with NHL more often presented mental status disturbances, aphasia, decreased alertness, motor deficits, seizures, occlusions of the straight sinus, deep venous system and cortical veins. Patients with NHL had a better prognosis in the acute phase and at the end of follow-up than those with HL, but a worse one than patients without brain lesions, as more NHL patients were dead or dependent (modified Rankin Scale score = 3-6) at discharge (19.7 vs. 6.5%, p < 0.001) and final follow-up (14.3 vs. 7.4%, p = 0.03). In Cox regression analysis, coma (HR = 13.7; 95% CI = 4.3-43.7) and thrombosis of the deep venous system (HR = 3.5; 95% CI = 1.4-8.7) were associated with death or dependency at the end of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Cerebral venous thrombosis patients with NHL are intermediate between patients without brain lesions and those with HL, both in initial clinical picture and prognosis.
