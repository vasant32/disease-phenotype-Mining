Recent myocardial infarction is a recognized risk factor for ischemic stroke. Patients who have a stroke in the peri-infarct period are usually in hospital and therefore well placed to access early cerebral reperfusion therapy. However, due to the risk of myocardial rupture, recent myocardial infarction is considered a contraindication to intravenous thrombolysis, which is usually the first-line therapy for the treatment of ischemic stroke. We report a case in which intravenous thrombolysis was safely and effectively used to treat acute ischemic stroke in a patient who had suffered an acute myocardial infarct within the previous 48 h. We also highlight the lack of evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of stroke in this important subgroup of patients.
