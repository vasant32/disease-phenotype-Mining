In order to find out the relationship between the cerebrovascular acetazolamide reactivity and platelet function in asymptomatic cerebral thrombosis, 10 cases of asymptomatic cerebral infarction and 10 age-matched control subjects were studied. The cerebrovascular acetazolamide reactivity was measured using xenon computed tomography method. As markers of platelet function, the plasma concentrations of platelet factor 4, beta-thromboglobulin, thromboxane B2, and 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 were determined. The cerebrovascular acetazolamide reactivity was significantly lower in the asymptomatic cerebral infarction group than in the control group. The plasma concentrations of platelet factor 4, beta-thromboglobulin, thromboxane B2, and 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 were higher in the asymptomatic cerebral infarction group than in the control group. There was a significant negative correlation between the cerebrovascular acetazolamide reactivity and the plasma concentrations of platelet factor 4, beta-thromboglobulin, thromboxane B2, and 11-dehydrothromboxane B2. The low cerebrovascular acetazolamide reactivity is considered to be related to platelet activation in asymptomatic cerebral thrombosis.
