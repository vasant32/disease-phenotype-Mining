BACKGROUND/AIMS: In this preliminary study, we investigated the efficacy of combined radiofrequency thermal ablation therapy (RFA) with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAI) in the treatment of multiple liver metastases from colorectal cancer. METHODOLOGY: Nine patients with bilobular multiple metastases was treated. The number of nodules was 6.0 +/- 3.9 (range: 2-13), and the size was 2.1 +/- 1.0 cm (range: 0.5-4.8 cm) in diameter. RFA was performed using a RF generator operating at 460 kHz with a 15-gauge, 4-prong custom RF needle. Treatment temperature was kept at 90-110 degrees C for 5 min. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) was administered by weekly 750-1250 mg/body/5 h as the regimen of HAI. RESULTS: During a 15.2-month follow-up period, 6 of 9 patients survived more than 1 year. Three of the 6 survived more than 2 years. Serum CEA level in 5 patients dropped from 24.5 +/- 9.5 ng/ml to 10.3 +/- 5.5 ng/ml. Local recurrence was observed in 5 patients and new lesions in 4. Extrahepatic recurrence was observed in 5 patients. There were no serious complications but one HAI-related cerebral thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: Combined RFA with HAI would be effective and safe. This modality provides a new option for the treatment of multiple liver metastases from colorectal cancer.
