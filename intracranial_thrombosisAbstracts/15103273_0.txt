Headache of subacute onset, associated with other signs of increased intracranial pressure, represents the most frequent symptom of cerebral thrombophlebitis.

Unfractionated intravenous heparin treatment resulted in resolution of subarachnoid hemorrhage on control brain CT scan and quick clinical recovery.
