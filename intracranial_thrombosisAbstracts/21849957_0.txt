A 21-year-old woman taking oral contraceptives presented with headaches, nausea, vomiting and somnolence. The next day she had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure after which her neurological condition deteriorated. CT and MRI showed multiple cerebral haemorrhages, while MR venography revealed extensive dural sinus and venous thrombosis involving almost all sinuses, great cerebral vein of Galen and internal cerebral veins. Two weeks after initiation of the anticoagulant treatment the patient recovered completely with complete recanalization of all cerebral sinuses and veins. Although the patient had conditions which were indicative of poor outcome, her neurological deficit improved completely, which correlated with recanalization of the thrombosed vessels.
