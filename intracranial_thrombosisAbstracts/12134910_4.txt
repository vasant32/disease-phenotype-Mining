Intracranial aneurysms in infants are rare, but are associated with a high risk of rupture and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The authors report a case of an incidentally diagnosed, probably congenital, asymptomatic giant aneurysm of the posterior communicating artery in a 9-month-old girl, which completely thrombosed following a diagnostic superselective angiography without any neuropathological incident. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the aneurysm decreased further in size and was largely resorbed within 3 years after the initial finding. In single cases the natural history of congenital giant aneurysms may be better than previously assumed.
