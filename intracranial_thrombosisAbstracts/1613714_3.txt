We describe a patient with antiphospholipid antibodies who presented with a rapid progression of hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, central retinal vein thrombosis, 2 cerebral thromboses and pulmonary hemorrhage. She was treated with high dose prednisolone, plasma exchange, high dose intravenous immunoglobulin and began taking cyclophosphamide without evidence of control of disease. However, the anemia and thrombocytopenia appeared to respond rapidly to low dose aspirin and she made a complete recovery without any further complications.
