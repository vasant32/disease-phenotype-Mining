BACKGROUND: Recent studies have focused on mechanical thrombectomy as a means to reduce the time required for revascularization and increase the revascularization rate in acute stroke. To date no systematic evaluation has been made of the different mechanical devices in this novel and fast-developing field of endovascular interventions. To facilitate such evaluations, we developed a specific in vivo model for mechanical thrombectomy that allows visualization of dislocation or fragmentation of the thrombus during angiographic manipulation. METHODS: Angiography and embolization with a preformed thrombus was performed in 8 swine. The thrombus was generated by mixing 25 IU bovine thrombin and 10 mL autologous blood. For visualization during angiography, 1 g barium sulfate was added. RESULTS: The preformed thrombus exhibited mechanical stability, reproducibility, and high radiographic absorption, providing excellent visibility during angiography. The setting allowed selective embolization of targeted vessels without thrombus fragmentation. Despite the application of barium sulfate no local or systemic reaction occurred. Histologic evaluation revealed no intimal damage caused by the thrombus or contrast agent washout. CONCLUSION: The model presented here allows selective and reliable thromboembolization of vessels that reproduce the anatomic and hemodynamic situation in acute cerebrovascular stroke. It permits visualization of the thrombus during angiography and intervention, providing unique insight into the behavior of both thrombus and device, which is potentially useful in the development and evaluation of mechanical clot retrieval in acute cerebrovascular stroke.
