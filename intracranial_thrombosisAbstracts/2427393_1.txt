The oral administration of the thrombolytic agent urokinase was studied. Its intestinal absorption was demonstrated in dogs by the observation of a prolonged urokinase activity in plasma with a concomitant lytic effect on artificial thrombi after intraduodenal administration. In situ intestine-liver perfusion experiments in dogs revealed that a plasminogen activator, distinct from the administered urokinase--thus presumed to be a tissue plasminogen activator--was liberated into the circulation in association with intestinal absorption of urokinase. Its absorption in men was demonstrated in a cross-over double blind study of oral urokinase on healthy subjects. On the basis of these results a double blind clinical trial of oral urokinase was performed on 101 patients with cerebral thrombosis. The results showed the usefulness of urokinase treatment, particularly in the early phase after the onset of stroke. The clinical effect was influenced by the plasma plasminogen level.
