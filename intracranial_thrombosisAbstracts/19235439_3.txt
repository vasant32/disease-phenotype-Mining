BACKGROUND: Hyperacute surgical evacuation of intracerebral hemorrhage is associated with a high rebleeding rate. The peri-operative administration of rFVIIa to patients with intracerebral hemorrhage may decrease the frequency of post-operative hemorrhage, and improve outcome. METHODS: Patients receiving recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIA) therapy immediately prior to acute surgery were collected at two centres. The intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) score and ICH Grading Scale were determined, as was long-term outcome using the modified Rankin Scale. Residual/recurrent clot was evaluated by comparing pre-operative to post-operative CT scans. RESULTS: Fifteen patients with intracerebral hemorrhage received 40-90 microg/kg of rFVIIa and underwent surgical hematoma evacuation at a median time of five hours following symptom onset. Median pre-operative clot volume was 60 ml, decreasing to 2 ml post-operatively. There were no thromboembolic adverse events. Thirteen patients survived, 11 (73%) were independent, and two (13%) had a moderate to severe disability. These outcomes were significantly better than expected based on the median ICH score (40% mortality) and based on median ICH Grading Scale (18% good outcome). CONCLUSIONS: The pre or perioperative administration of rFVIIa resulted in minimal residual or recurrent hematoma volume and may be an important adjunct to surgery in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage.
