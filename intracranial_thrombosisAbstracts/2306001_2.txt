During cerebral angiographic examination of a sixty-five-year-old white male, an acute right hemiplegia resulting from embolic occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery developed. Intravenous streptokinase therapy was initiated within forty-five minutes of symptom onset and the hemiplegia cleared in approximately one hour with no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. This observation underscores the applicability and potential benefits of immediate intravenous thrombolytic therapy for selected patients presenting with acute cerebral thrombosis or embolism.
