BACKGROUND: Isolated cortical vein thrombosis is only rarely diagnosed, although it may commonly be overlooked. RESULTS: We report on four patients with this diagnosis who all presented with focal sensorimotor seizures. The diagnosis was made by a typical CT and MRI-pattern, which is described in detail. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis was excellent in all patients and the treatment options are discussed.
