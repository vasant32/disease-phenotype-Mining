Forty-three patients with metastatic liver cancer were treated with multiple chemotherapy by the intra-arterial route. Metastases originated from primary cancer of the breast (16) or colon (10), melanoma (7) and miscellaneous tumours (10). In 35 patients chemotherapy was administered by selective catheterization of the hepatic artery via the axillary artery; it usually (31 cases) consisted of doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) and mitomycin (10 mg/m2) injections, and continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (1 g/24 or 72 hours). In 14 patients (10 responders to the above method and 4 new cases), a catheter with subcutaneous chamber was implanted surgically so that chemotherapy could be continued through the chamber. Blood toxicity was usually moderate. The main complication of injections through the catheter (114) or through the chamber (60) was thrombosis. However, except for 1 lethal cerebral thrombosis, the others (axillary artery 3, hepatic artery 5) were unattended by functional symptoms. Transient biochemical signs of hepatic cytolysis were frequent after each course. Hepatic insufficiency was severely aggravated in 2 cases. Painful digestive disorders were relieved by symptomatic treatments. Four complete responses, 16 partial responses, 8 stabilizations and 10 failures were observed; 5 patients died soon after one single course of intra-arterial therapy. The high response rates (greater than 50%) in metastases from cancer of the breast and colon, and chiefly the 3 complete responses obtained in patients with mammary carcinoma were most encouraging, bearing in mind that one of these 3 patients had not responded to intravenous chemotherapy.
