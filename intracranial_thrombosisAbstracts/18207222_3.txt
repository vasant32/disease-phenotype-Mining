BACKGROUND: Pompe disease or type 2 glycogen storage disease is an inherited condition that generally afflicts the heart and skeletal muscle. Nervous tissue involvement is known; however, the effect on cerebral vasculature is less well understood. CASE DESCRIPTION: The thrombotic complications of a fusiform basilar artery aneurysm in a young adult patient with Pompe disease is presented with complete CT, MRI, and angiographic findings. CONCLUSION: We suggest that in young adult patients with Pompe disease, MRA screening of intracerebral vessels may be considered with the goal of potentially diagnosing thrombotic and thromboembolic complications.
