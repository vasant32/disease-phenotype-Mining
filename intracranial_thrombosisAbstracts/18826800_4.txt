OBJECTIVE: Neurovascular ultrasound (nUS) is widely used as a screening and monitoring tool in patients with spontaneous cervical artery dissection (sCAD). The aim of the study was to describe the sonographical course of the affected arteries in patients with a MRI-proven sCAD by repetitive nUS. METHODS: Thirty-seven consecutive patients aged<60 years with 1.5 T MRI-proven sCAD were prospectively investigated by nUS, and within 48 hours after admission before MRI. The patients were re-investigated after 6 months and again after a period>12 months. RESULTS: Forty-nine sCAD were detected in 37 patients; 24 lesions (49%) were located in the internal carotid arteries (ICA), and 25 (51%) in the vertebral arteries (VA). An arterial occlusion was found in 13 arteries (27%). The recanalization rate of occluded arteries was 62%. Regression of stenosis/occlusion within the first 6 months was found in 34 (69%) of the affected arteries, while between 6 and >12 months, the improvement rate was lower (19%). A complete recanalization without residual stenosis after 6 months was found in 39%. In only one artery, initial high grade ICA stenosis progressed to complete persistent occlusion (2%). DISCUSSION: The course of arterial stenosis or occlusion caused by sCAD is highly dynamic during the first 6 month after the event. The vast majority of arteries show regression of stenosis or recanalization of initial occlusion. Only a minority of patients experience a persistent deterioration of the vessel status.
