A new case of familial PHP, associated with polyglobulia and biochemical parameters of hyperaldosteronism has been described. This association represents a very rare entity. PHP has been documented by the common tests and the unresponsiveness of AMPc to PTH. The poliglobulia , which appears after a period of severe anaemia, needs now periodical blood subtraction; nevertheless a cerebral thrombosis with conseguent hemiparesis has recently occurred. The hyperaldosteronism has been documented by hypopotassiemia , a raised level of plasma aldosterone as well as suppressed plasma renin activity even after adequate stimulus.
