BACKGROUND: cerebral venous thrombophlebitis (CVT) is a rare but serious pathology. The pregnancy and especially the postpartum constitute supporting circumstances occured of the CVT. AIM: the aim of our study is to remember the symptomatology of CVT, the importance of the IRM and the angio IRM in the diagnosis of CVT, and its treatment. OBSERVATIONS: We present a retrospective study relating to 7 cases of CVT during gravidopuerperality over 7 years (1996 to 2002). The average age of our patients is 32.1 years. The CVT occured during the first trimester of the pregnancy in one case and in the postpartum in 6 cases. The symptomatology was dominated by cephalgia and the signs of intracranian hypertension. Convulsions occured in 3 cases. The diagnosis of CVT was confirmed by IRM coupled with the Angio-IRM in all cases. The treatment by heparinotherapy was instaured immediately and relayed by the Anti-Vit K as the evolution was favorable in all cases. CONCLUSION: cerebral venous thrombophebitis (CVT) is a serious pathology (especially in pregnancy and post partum). The diagnosis is performed by the magnetic resonance imaging (IRM) and the early introduction of the heparinotherapy.
