A patient with widespread livedo reticularis and transient cerebral ischaemia (Sneddon's syndrome) is described. She also had painful scarring ulcers of the lower legs resembling livedo vasculitis and a circulating anticardiolipin antibody. We suggest that Sneddon's syndrome and livedo vasculitis may be pathogenetically related.
