We examined various hemostatic molecular markers in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation(DIC), deep vein thrombosis(DVT), pulmonary embolism(PE), acute myocardial infarction(AMI), cerebral thrombosis(CT) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura(TTP). Global tests were sensitive for DIC but not for pre-DIC. However, hemostatic molecular markers such as soluble fibrin were sensitive for both DIC and pre-DIC. Hemostatic molecular markers were also useful for analysis of DIC in a baboon DIC model. Activated protein C-protein C inhibitor complex and plasminogen activator inhibitor-I were useful for the diagnosis of DVT, PE, AMI or CT. These findings suggests that hemostatic molecular markers are useful for the diagnosis of various thrombotic disorders.
