We report a patient with cerebral venous thrombosis who presented with acute onset of severe prolonged vertigo, nausea, vomiting, unilateral decreased caloric response and occipital headache, simultaneously with acute venous cerebral infarcts on brain MRI. Although the patient had occipital headache, overall symptoms and signs closely mimicked those of acute unilateral vestibulopathy. Cerebral venous thrombosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute unilateral vestibular syndrome.
