We report a patient with clinical and neuroimaging findings of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) who developed cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). An association between SIH and CVT has rarely been observed. Anticoagulation therapy was administered. The clinical course was subsequently complicated by a large subdural hematoma that required neurosurgical evacuation. The present report indicates that SIH should not be always considered a benign condition, especially when associated with CVT and subdural fluid collections. Furthermore, clinicians should be aware of the potential risks of anticoagulant therapy in patients with SIH and CVT.
