Striatocapsular infarction is a distinct form of stroke, but few histopathological studies have been performed concerning acute lesions. We report the postmortem findings of a patient with an infarct who died shortly after onset. A 72-year-old man died of acute myocardial infarction 6 days after the onset of left-sided striatocapsular infarction. Autopsy revealed thrombus formation of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) trunk. The lateral striate arteries irrigating the area of the infarct branched off distal to the arterial segment occluded with a thrombus. The cortical vessels were perfused by leptomeningeal collaterals. This report histopathologically confirmed thrombus formation of the MCA resulting in striatocapsular infarction.
