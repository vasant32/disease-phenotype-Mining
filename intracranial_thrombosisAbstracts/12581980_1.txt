OBJECTIVE: To study the early diagnosis and treatment of intracranial venous thrombosis. METHOD: The etiology, clinical manifestations, presentations in cerebral CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalogram (EEG) features, and the results of cerebral spinal fluid and blood rheological examinations were analyzed in 8 cases of intracranial venous thrombosis. RESULTS: Thrombosis often arose during the puerperium and from infection, with the frequent presentations of intracranial hypertension and focal neurological defect. CT and MRI examinations were helpful in the diagnosis. CONCLUSION: For patients who present both intracranial hypertension and focal neurological defects, especially during the puerperium or with infection episodes, CT and MRI examinations should be performed to detect intracranial venous thrombosis.
