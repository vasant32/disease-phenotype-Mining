We report a case of a 49-year-old woman with headache who was diagnosed with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) of the superior sagittal and right transverse sinuses. Serial gradient recalled-echo T2*-weighted imaging (T2*WI) studies demonstrated dynamic changes of thrombosed segments. T2*WI is useful not only as a diagnostic tool for CVT, but also in evaluating changes to thrombus.
