Patients with chronic myeloproliferative disease are at increased risk of both thromboembolic and haemorrhagic complications. Cerebral thrombosis is a common cause of death in myeloproliferative disease patients. Picotamide is a new anti-platelet drug sharing a dual anti-thromboxane activity: inhibition of thromboxane A2 synthase and thromboxane A2 receptor antagonism. Picotamide inhibits in vitro and ex vivo platelet aggregation induced by different agonists. Interestingly, in vitro studies show that picotamide is able to increase prostacycline biosynthesis. In the clinical setting, picotamide treatment induces only a slight prolongation of bleeding time. The safety and efficacy of picotamide long-term treatment in 15 patients with essential thrombocytosis and a positive history of previous thromboembolic events was evaluated. After 12-month treatment with picotamide no patients suffered from thrombotic events and only one minor and transient bleeding episode was observed. This observational long-term trial shows that picotamide treatment in patients with thrombocytosis at high risk of thrombotic events is safe and well tolerated. Picotamide did not increase the risk of bleeding in these patients, while at the same time, no thrombotic events were observed during the 1-year treatment.
