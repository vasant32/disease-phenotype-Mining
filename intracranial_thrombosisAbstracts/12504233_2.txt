PURPOSE: Among the locations of venous thrombosis, even if rare, cerebral-vein thrombosis is a severe event with a high mortality rate. No aetiology is found in 20 to 30% of the cases. In recent years, inherited coagulation disorders have been described, as risk factors for venous thrombosis. We report the results of a retrospective study of 27 patients who suffered cerebral-vein thrombosis, in which coagulation abnormalities have been searched for. METHOD: The patients were referred to the haemostasis laboratory of the Henri Mondor hospital between august 1982 and June 1988, after a cerebral-vein thrombosis. The predisposing factors, personal and family history of thromboembolism, clinical presentation, thrombosis location, evolution under treatment and long-term outcome, have been noted. Deficiencies in antithrombine, protein C, protein S, the Factor V Leiden and the G20210A prothrombin-gene mutation, the presence of lupus anticoagulant, of anticardiolipin antibodies as well as a hyperhomocysteinaemia have been searched, either at the initial presentation, or a posteriori. RESULTS: Fourty-one percent of patients had a coagulation abnormality. The prevalence of the different abnormalities was: inherited deficiency in AT 7.4%, in PC 8%, in PS 12.5%, factor V Leiden mutation 12%, G20210A prothrombin-gene mutation 12%. Two patients had combined defects: AT and PC deficiency in one, F V Leiden and F II G20210A mutations in one. e of the patient had lupus anticoagulant. Three patients had a significant rate of anticardiolipin antibodies. Five patients out of eight displayed a moderate hyperhomocysteinaemia. Nothing (past history, age, predisposing factors) distinguished those patients bearing a coagulation disorder from the others. The venous thromboembolic relapse rate of 15 % (4/27 patients). Three of them had an inherited thrombophilic abnormality. CONCLUSION: We recommend an investigation of the haemostasis after every cerebral venous thrombosis.
