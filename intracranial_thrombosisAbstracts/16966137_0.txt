In order to exploit systems for shock wave therapy, we are working for the development of clinical devices that are based on the concept of shock waves or related phenomena. The paper describes these new therapeutic devices designed for the minimally invasive approach to vascular thromboloysis, selective dissection of tissues, and drug or DNA delivery. To investigate the response of cells to shock loading, a precise method of shock waves generation in space and time has been developed. This method has been studied for application in cardiovascular therapy, cancer treatment, and cranioplasty in close vicinity of the brain. A laser ablation shock wave assisted particle acceleration device has been developed for delivering drug and DNA into soft targets in the human body. The penetration depth of microparticles observed in the experimental targets is believed to be sufficient for pharmacological treatments. In order to achieve an efficient method for rapid revascularization of cerebral thrombosis, a laser induced liquid jet (LILJ) system has been developed. The LILJ has been successfully applied for selective dissection of soft tissue preserving nerve and blood vessels. The system has been further improved by using piezoelectric actuators to drive the liquid jets, as an alternative to pulse laser.
