BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recanalization of occluded vessels in acute ischemic stroke is associated with improved outcome. Devices that can quickly and safely remove thrombus and promote recanalization are useful in the management of these patients. The Alligator retrieval device, developed for endovascular foreign body retrieval, may also be useful for thrombus removal. METHODS: Seven patients with acute ischemic stroke (aged 31 to 88 years) who underwent intra-arterial therapy with the Alligator retrieval device at our center are presented. RESULTS: The Alligator retrieval device was able to retrieve the thrombus in 5 of 7 cases with good to excellent recanalization seen and was unsuccessful in 2 of 7 patients. Complete recanalization was obtained in one of 7 patients and near complete recanalization obtained in 4 of 7 patients. Three of the 7 patients had good outcome at 3 months and 3 of 7 patients died within 30 days of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The Alligator retrieval device was successfully able to remove thrombus in the majority of cases. It appears to have increased success in proximal occlusions in relatively straight segments. In properly selected cases, it may be a useful device in intra-arterial stroke management.
