We describe four cases in which abciximab was used as a thrombolytic rescue agent in the setting of thrombotic events complicating interventional neuroradiologic procedures. After IV administration of abciximab, the thrombus resolved within 30 min in three cases, whereas no thrombolysis occurred in the fourth case despite the addition of intraarterial tissue plasminogen activator. Further evaluation of glycoprotein IIb-IIIa inhibitors in patients with cerebral thromboembolic events is necessary to prove clinical efficacy.
