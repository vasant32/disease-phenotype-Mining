We investigated the anticardiolipin antibody (ACA) in a series of patients with cerebral infarction without systemic lupus erythematosus (SLA). Clinical and laboratory data were assessed from a series of 250 non-SLE patients with cerebral infarction who visited our clinic from 1988 to 1990. The concentration of anticardiolipin IgG antibody was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. An elevated ACA level was defined as one which was greater than 3 standard deviations above the mean level for normal controls. We examined the CT findings and risk factors for stroke such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia and cardiac disease. Laboratory data such as the platelet count, the presence of lupus anticoagulant and a biologic false-positive test for syphilis were also investigated. Among the 250 patients with infarction, IgG ACA was detected in 22 (8.8%). There was no significant difference in incidence of ACA between the patients with cerebral thrombosis and those with cerebral embolism. On CT scan, multiple cerebral infarcts were noted in 18 of the 22 patients. As regards the location of the infarct, the cerebral cortex together with the basal ganglia was more common than isolated lesions of the cortex or basal ganglia. Concerning the risk factors for stroke, hypertension was noted in 12, diabetes mellitus in 2, hyperlipidemia in 2 and cardiac disease in 2. Lupus anticoagulant and thrombocytopenia were not detected in any of the cases. A biologic false-positive test for syphilis was observed in one case. Dementia was present in 12 of the 22 patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
