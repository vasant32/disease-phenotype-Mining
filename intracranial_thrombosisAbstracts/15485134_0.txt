1. Stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP/Izm), which become severely hypertensive and exhibit a very high incidence of stroke (cerebral hemorrhage and/or infarction), are used widely for the study of the hypertension and stroke. In the previous study, we indicated that high thrombotic tendency of cerebral microvessels in SHRSP/Izm compared with stroke-resistant SHR (SHR/Izm) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY/Izm) at aged period. 2. L-arginine, a substrate of nitric oxide (NO), and voluntary exercise reduced blood pressure and thrombotic tendency in cerebral microvessels caused by highly production of NO in vivo. Furthermore, antioxidants show that the effects of antihypertensive and antithrombosis in SHRSP/Izm. 3. Although SHRSP/Izm become genetically hypertensive and exhibit stroke, a number of nutritional factors, particularly antioxydative nutrient, have preventive effects on hypertension, cerebral blood flow dysfunction, thrombus formation, and neuronal cell death in SHRSP/Izm. Our results indicate that those treatments are beneficial in the prevention of hypertension and stroke and that the nutritional science is very important for "prediction and prevention medicine."
