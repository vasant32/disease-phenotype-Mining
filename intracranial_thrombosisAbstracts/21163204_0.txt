 INTRODUCTION: Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a multifactorial process with a wide clinical spectrum and many associated risk factors (RF) that could be complicated with venous infarction (VI). We study the influence of RF in the developing of venous infarction in patients with CVT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An observational study with consecutive inclusion of patients with CVT diagnosis admitted to the Stroke Unit of a Neurology Department between 1995 and 2007. RF were identified and their distribution according to the presence of VI was analysed. RESULTS: A total of 52 patients were included (37 female; 71.15%) with mean age of 46.73 years (range 18-78 years). The most frequent RF associated with CVT were thrombophilia (26.92%) and oral contraceptives (OC) (25% of all the patients and in 35.13% of females). The most frequent RF in patients with venous infarction was thrombophilia (40.9%), whilst in the CVT group without venous infarction the use of oral contraceptives predominated (26.7% of the total sample; 38% of females), with thrombophilic states only being detected in 16.5%. No cases of venous infarction were found in the group of patients with oral contraceptives but without an associated thrombophilic state. CONCLUSION: There appears to be a different profile of associated RF in patients with venous infarction associated to CVT, with the presence of thrombophilia prevailing.
