Giant or large intracranial aneurysms are the vascular neurosurgeon's greatest challenge. At our department, we have treated one hundred and thirty nine patients with giant or large intracranial aneurysms between 1975 and 2001. These included 37 partially thrombosed giant aneurysms. 75 aneurysms were giant (> 2.5 cm) and 64 were large aneurysms (2-2.5 cm). Three-dimensional computed tomography angiograms were performed in patients besides MRI angiography and digital subtraction angiography. These were found to be very valuable in the preoperative assessment of surgical anatomy of the aneurysm with respect to the branch arteries and perforators origin besides knowing the relations to the skull base. With our experience in surgical treatment of these 139 cases, we find that the basic technique is trapping and evacuation and not just clipping of the aneurysm neck but also reconstruction of the artery bearing the aneurysm, especially with wide-necked aneurysms. Use of multiple clipping, tandem clipping or dome clipping as per the intraoperative situation, is very helpful in dealing with giant aneurysms as also is the use of different types of clips like fenestrated clip with straight clip (combination clipping), booster clip, dome clips etc. While selecting surgical strategy for partially thrombosed giant aneurysm, securing the neck is most important. If the neck is too narrow to reconstruct, aneurysmectomy with anastomosis is one of the surgical strategies. An extracranial intracranial bypass should be considered in cases where clipping or parent artery ligation is expected to be associated with compromise of cerebral circulation.
