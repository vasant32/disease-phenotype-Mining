BACKGROUND: We aimed to identify the rate of major neurologic improvement (MNI) at 24 h following endovascular recanalization therapy (ERT) for acute ischemic stroke and its association with short-term outcome. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients presenting to our institution over 4 years and undergoing ERT. Angiograms were independently reviewed. Data on demographics, medical history, initial NIHSS score, 24-hour NIHSS score, site of acute vascular lesion, pre- and posttreatment Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction scores, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (within 36 h of intervention that was associated with a 4-point decline in NIHSS score) and discharge disposition were collected. We used logistic regression analysis to identify predictors of MNI (defined as >or=8-point improvement in NIHSS or a score of 0-1 at 24 h) and favorable discharge status (defined as home or acute rehabilitation). RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were included (median age = 71 years, 60% women, median NIHSS score = 19.5, anterior circulation = 75%). The modes of ERT were pharmacologic only (28%), mechanical only (35%) and multimodal therapy (37%). Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 2 or 3 recanalization was achieved in 64.7% (mechanical only 46%, pharmacologic only 63% and multimodal 84%). The outcomes were: symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (11.8%), MNI (26.5%) and favorable discharge (41.2%). Age (OR = 0.93, p = 0.003) and cardioembolic stroke subtype (OR = 6.0, p = 0.018) were independent predictors of MNI. MNI was a strong predictor of favorable discharge status (OR = 46.4, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite initial stroke severity, MNI occurred in over one fourth of the patients and independently and strongly predicted favorable discharge outcome.
