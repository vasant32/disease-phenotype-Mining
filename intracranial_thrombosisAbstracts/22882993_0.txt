Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with long-term increase in the incidence of cerebrovascular disease, heart failure and mortality. The incidence of ischemic stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation averages 5 % per year, from two to seven more frequent than in patients without atrial fibrillation (AF). One in six ischemic stroke occurs in patients with AF. The detection and accurate diagnosis and timely therapeutic intervention have shown a decrease in morbidity and mortality associated with this arrhythmia. The above data by themselves justify the development of a management guide and care for these patients. The purpose of this guide is to provide health professionals recommendations based on the best available evidence with the intent to standardize actions: diagnosis and identification of patients with atrial fibrillation; risk stratification and treatment according to the classification of atrial fibrillation; identification of the risk of thromboembolism and its prevention; and treatment guidelines to determine which patient will require to be referred promptly.
