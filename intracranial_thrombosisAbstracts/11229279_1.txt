Morbidity and mortality in puerperal cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) can be reduced by arresting the progression of thrombosis using heparin. However, conventional dose of heparin requires monitoring of coagulation parameters and carries a risk of haemorrhage. The present study involved 56 patients of puerperal CVT with CT evidence of haemorrhagic infarction. Twenty nine of these patients received low dose heparin till 30th post-partum day or symptomatic relief. Their clinical features and severity were similar to 27 patients who did not receive heparin. The mortality and morbidity at discharge was significantly less (P < 0.001) in heparin treated group. There were no haemorrhagic complications. Low dose heparin is safe and effective in cerebral venous thrombosis, even with haemorrhagic infarction.
