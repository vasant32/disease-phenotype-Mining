We report four new cases of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) occurring in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Each patient had undergone lumbar puncture at varying times prior to clinical presentation (4 days to over 1 year). Only two of the patients had received intravenous (i.v.) methylprednisolone 48 h prior to CVT and were under oral contraception, a risk factor for cerebral thrombophlebitis. The other two patients had not undergone recent lumbar puncture, were not taking corticosteroids and did not present vascular risk factors. The patients all had normal routine blood work-ups and none had thrombophilia. All patients dramatically improved with full systemic heparinization. Minor sequelae were noticed in two patients. The pathogenesis underlying the occurrence of CVT in MS patients remains unclear and we discuss the relationship between lumbar puncture, steroid treatment and CVT.
