The TMAs are a group of microvascular occlusive disorders characterized by thrombocytopenia and intravascular hemolysis. Literature review reveals a spectrum of neuroimaging findings, including a single case report of multifocal hemorrhagic infarctions. We present a series of 12 patients with TMA demonstrating a similar pattern of multifocal cortical and subcortical hemorrhagic infarctions.
