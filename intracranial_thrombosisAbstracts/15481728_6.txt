The authors emphasize an unusual complication of venous angiomas in the brain: venous infarction. The patient in this case is a 32-year-old man who presented with a clinical history of headache followed by a worsening of his neurological status. Neuroimaging studies demonstrated a brain infarct in the posterior fossa, which was related to thrombosis of the draining vein of a cerebral venous angioma. A conservative treatment approach without anticoagulation therapy was followed and the patient completely recovered. Nonhemorragic venous infarction caused by thrombosis of a venous angioma is exceptional and only nine previous cases have been reported in the literature.
