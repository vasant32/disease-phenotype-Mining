 OBJECTIVE: To explore the protective effects of rhubarb aglycone combined with urokinase (UK) thrombolysis on brain microvascular basement membrane impairment in rats with thrombus-occluded cerebral ischemia by regulating the expression of IgG, CoLIV and LN in rats brain, by which the level of injury of brain microvascular basement membrane could be detected. METHOD: Rats were randomly divided into sham-operated, model, thrombolysis, rhubarb aglycone and combination (rhubarb aglycone combined with thrombolysis) groups. Moreover, rats in model, thrombolysis, rhubarb aglycone and combination groups were randomly divided into 3, 6, and 9 h groups respectively. Model of thrombus-occluded cerebral ischemia was duplicated by using the combination of rats' auto-thrombus with inserting the nylon thread. Rats were administrated with thrombolysis therapy through artery at 3, 6, and 9 h after cerebral ischemia. At 24 h of administration through artery, intracranial hemorrhage ratio (ICHR) and mortality of rats were observed, and then the brain of rats was taken. In the study, expression of IgG, CoLIV and LN in rats brain were measured. RESULT: Thrombolysis at 9 h of cerebral ischemia made rats mortality and BHR increase, administration of combined therapy could make them decrease. Expression of IgG level in rats brain of 9 h and 6 h model groups increased, while CoLIV and LN expression decreased significantly. In each administration 9 h group, IgG level was lower, and CoLIV and LN were higher, such changes appeared significantly in rhubarb aglycone and association groups. CONCLUSION: Brain microvascular basement membrane impairment could be caused by the therapy of delayed thrombolysis, which made the mortality and BHR increase. Rhubarb aglycone combined with the therapy of thrombolysis could perform the protective effects on brain microvascular basement membrane and then decrease the ICHR and mortality caused by thrombolysis after cerebral ischemia.
