OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence, case fatality and risk factors of acute cerebral arterial thrombosis complicated by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in 830 patients with acute cerebral arterial thrombosis, among whom 89 also developed MODS. RESULTS: The incidence of MODS in these patients was 10.7% with case fatality of 58.4%. The presence of concurrent infection and increased number of organ involved both resulted in higher case fatality. The preceding health status, number of failing organs and score of neurologic impairment were the main fetal factors according to logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSION: MODS usually occurs in two weeks after the onset of acute cerebral arterial thrombosis. Prevention of MODS involves rigorous treatment of the compromised organs and comprehensive systemic therapy in addition to the management of the primary diseases.
