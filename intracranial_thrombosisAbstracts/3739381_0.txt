The clinical manifestations of cerebrovascular diseases observed in the 7th District of Budapest between 1970 and 1976 were analyzed and the patients' further fate followed up between 1981 and 1985. It could be stated that out of the total of 1550 cases of cerebrovascular diseases registered the number of cerebral thromboses was essentially higher and that of cerebral haemorrhage markedly lower as compared to data given in the international literature. Therefore, patients with cerebrovascular diseases treated in the hospital of the 7th District were also included in the analysis. Results showed cerebral haemorrhages to occur more frequently as compared to the number of those treated in the territory; the number of thromboses was also significantly higher in these clinical patients as compared to international data. For the purpose of a more precise diagnosis the autopsy results of patients with cerebrovascular diseases who were treated and died in hospital were also reviewed. The thrombosis-cerebral haemorrhage ratio corroborated the clinically established diagnostic results. Autopsy results revealed the existence of a severe arteriosclerosis. The degree of severity in patients with a cerebrovascular disease revealed no difference as compared to other patients who died primarily because of heart diseases. It showed, however, a pronounced deviation in patients who died because of carcinoma. A more detailed investigation of these findings will be a future task.
