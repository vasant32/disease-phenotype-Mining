The pattern of neurological disease seen in Ethiopian patients hospitalized in general medical wards in two hospitals in Addis Ababa is analyzed and discussed. Cerebrovascular disease, most commonly cerebral thrombosis, accounted for 45% of the neurological diseases seen. The second commonest disorder was bacterial meningitis (12%). Hepatic encephalopathy and intracranial haemorrhage, the latter commonly due to hypertension, were found to be the commonest causes of admission in coma.
