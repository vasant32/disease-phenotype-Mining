A 72-year-old patient was referred to the neuroradiological department for diagnostic angiography. She was suffering from vertigo and double vision. Magnetic resonance imaging performed elsewhere had demonstrated a giant aneurysm of the basilar artery tip 2 cm in diameter. Angiography revealed a large aneurysm with a broad neck that was partially thrombosed, which precluded closure by coiling. Neurosurgical management by clipping also appeared to be unsuitable because of the proximity to the cerebrum. The decision was reached to proceed expectantly by closely monitoring the clinical course. When the aneurysm increased in size in the ensuing weeks, coiling was performed successfully. Angiographic follow-up showed reperfusion of the aneurysm neck and closure was again achieved by repeat coiling. Reperfusion is not a rare complication following coiling and often necessitates renewed intervention.
