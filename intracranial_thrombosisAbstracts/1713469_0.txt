The chromium levels in the hair of patients with hyperlipemia and coronary heart disease were found to be similar to those of healthy controls (p greater than 0.2). In patients with cerebral hemorrhage and cerebral thrombosis, significantly higher hair chromium values were observed than in healthy subjects (p less than 0.001). The possible significance of these findings is discussed.
