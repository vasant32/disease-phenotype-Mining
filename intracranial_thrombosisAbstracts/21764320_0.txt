Isolated cortical vein thrombosis (ICVT) in the absence of sinus or great venous involvement is rare. Various MRI sequences have been proposed for diagnostic accuracy, although follow-up data are limited. The optimal management strategy remains uncertain. Patients with ICVT treated between 2006 and 2008 were retrospectively studied. Diagnostic and follow-up neuroimaging were reviewed independently, and we evaluated their treatment and outcomes. Five patients (mean age 41 years; range, 25-54 years) were included. All presented with seizures. Focal neurological deficits were noted in one patient only. T2 susceptibility-weighted MRI abnormalities were observed in all patients. T2-weighted parenchymal hyperintensities involving the cortical-subcortical regions around the ICVT had completely resolved on follow-up scans. Clinical outcomes were uniformly good, despite variable treatment strategies. We observed significant, yet reversible, parenchymal T2-weighted MRI lesions in our patients with ICVT. Follow-up clinical and radiological studies demonstrate recovery independent of treatment regimes. T2-weighted MRI was found to be a useful diagnostic tool and might improve diagnostic accuracy in carefully selected patients with new-onset seizures.
