AIM: To investigate whether the factor V Leiden mutation (FVL), the prothrombin gene G20210A variant or the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T genotype are risk factors for central nervous system (CNS) thrombosis or intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in neonates. METHODS: Thirteen full-term infants with cerebral infarct documented with magnetic resonance imaging were assessed with the whole spectrum of assays for thrombophilia including the three DNA-based prothrombotic factors. The frequency of congenital defects was compared with that observed in 38 healthy full-term infants. The genetic defects were also assessed in 55 premature neonates, gestational age <32 wk, 17 of whom developed IVH, grade II-IV. The remaining 38 premature neonates without IVH were used as controls. RESULTS: In the CNS thrombosis group: a prothrombotic factor was detected in 53% of patients and an underlying disease or a triggering event in 61.5%. The frequency of FVL in thrombosed neonates was higher (23%) than in the group of healthy full-term infants (10.5%), although it did not reach statistical significance. IVH developed in 30.9% of premature neonates. Apart from several maternal or neonatal risk factors for IVH, FII G20210A was found in a considerably higher prevalence in the cohort of neonates with IVH (12%) than in those without (2%), although the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The pathogenesis of cerebral thrombosis or IVH in neonates is multifactorial. Along with underlying diseases or triggering events, congenital prothrombotic factors (FVL or FII G20210A) showed a trend towards a higher frequency in full-term infants with CNS thrombosis or premature neonates with IVH than in controls. However, their contribution to neonatal cerebral thrombosis or IVH remains to be determined.
