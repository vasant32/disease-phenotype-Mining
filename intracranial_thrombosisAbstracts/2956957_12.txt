A randomized double-blind cross-over study was conducted to determine the inhibitory effects of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), ticlopidine (TP) and cilostazol (OPC-13013; in the following briefly called CS), a new antithrombotic agent on platelet functions ex vivo. Nine patients with cerebral thrombosis were enrolled in this study. Patients were given each of the three drugs for one week in a complete cross-over design according to a randomization schedule, followed by a wash-out period with a placebo for one week. It was found that CS and TP significantly inhibited platelet aggregation induced by ADP. Collagen- and arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation was all inhibited by CS, TP and ASA. Duncan's multiple range test to compare the anti-platelet effects of the three drugs revealed that: CS greater than ASA and TP greater than ASA in inhibiting ADP-induced platelet aggregation and CS greater than TP and ASA greater than TP in inhibiting arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation. These results may suggest that CS is superior to ASA and TP in inhibiting platelet aggregation ex vivo.
