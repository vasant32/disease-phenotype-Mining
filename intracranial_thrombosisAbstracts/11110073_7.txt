We report a 20-year-old woman who suffered headaches before presenting with a state of fluctuating vigilance. MRI showed diffuse high signal in the basal ganglia bilaterally on diffusion- and T2-weighted images, which had areas of both low and high apparent diffusion coefficient, presumed to correspond to cytotoxic and vasogenic oedema. MR venography showed no flow in the deep cerebral veins or straight sinus. Heparin was given, with clinical recovery. On follow-up MRI, the appearances became normal.
