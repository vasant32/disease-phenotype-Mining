INTRODUCTION: Splenomegaly caused by hematologic or infectious diseases is a well-known complication that may cause discomfort because of increased intra-abdominal pressure; however, complete obstruction of the large bowel usually never occurs. METHODS: We present a case of a 76-year-old male with polycythemia vera admitted with symptoms of complete colonic obstruction. At operation, the descending colon was found to be completely obstructed by a large adhesive spleen. Incision of the adhesions, complete colonoscopy, and mobilization of the colon was performed. RESULTS: Afterward, the patient had a normal colonic function; however, four days later he had a magnetic resonance-confirmed cerebral thrombosis followed by an episode of aspiration pneumonia, which he died of ten days after the operation. CONCLUSIONS: Colonic obstruction caused by splenomegaly is extremely rare, but may happen in patients with hematologic diseases.
