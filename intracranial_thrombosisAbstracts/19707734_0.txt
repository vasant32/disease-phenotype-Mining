We present the case of a 49-year-old female patient who underwent a lumbar puncture in the context of an extended diagnostic work-up after a transient ischemic attack. A few days later the patient who suffered from severe post-lumbar puncture headache, developed a lobar hemorrhage due to a cortical venous thrombosis requiring decompression surgery.
