In order to explore the pathogenic risk factors or protective factors of cerebral thrombosis, 1:1 matched case control study was done in 110 cases diagnosed by computerized tomography (CT). Both cases and controls were selected from several provincial and municipal hospitals in Jinan, Shandong Province, China. Every case was matched with one control on sex, race, age, occupation, residential area, educational level and economic status. 31 factors were analysed and 9 risk or protective factors were found by univariate analysis and multiple stepwise regression. Using the same 9 factors as independent variables, conditional logistic regression was performed and 4 factors were confirmed as pathogenic risk factors or protective factor of cerebral thrombosis (alpha = 0.01). They are high blood pressure (beta = 3.46, OR = 7.57), abdominal skinfold thickness (beta = 3.21, OR = 3.77), familial aggregation of stroke (beta = 2.25, OR = 12.64) and high level HDL2-C (beta = -2.99, OR = 0.16). Moreover, reliability of collective data and control o: bias were evaluated and discussed.
