Intracranial aneurysms are extremely rare in infancy. No consensus has yet been developed about the exact treatment of this rare situation. The authors report the case of a 47-day-old male infant who had multiple seizures on the same day, leading to the diagnosis of an intracranial aneurysm. The case was managed conservatively with close imaging follow-up, and the patient had a good recovery. The results of neurological examination were completely normal at the 5-year follow-up visit.   These rare lesions may be suspected on the basis of clinical findings and correctly diagnosed with current neuroradiological imaging modalities. The authors believe this report contributes valuable imaging data on rare childhood aneurysms to the literature, as well as emphasizing the importance of clinical and imaging information in therapeutic decision making in children with intracranial vascular problems.
