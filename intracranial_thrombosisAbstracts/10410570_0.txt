Of 43 elderly patients who were suspected to have polycythemia between October 1990 and July 1998, 12 patients showed an increased red cell volume measured by 51Cr-labeled red blood cells. We analyzed the clinical characteristics of the 12 patients consisted of 7 men and 5 women, with a median age of 71 (range: 57-92). Chief complaints were headaches and dizziness (3 cases), symptoms of other conditions than polycythemia (4 cases). Five patients had no symptoms. Five of 6 patients over 70 years old had no symptoms due to polycythemia. Seven cases (58%) showed splenomegaly and three cases (25%) showed hepatomegaly. Laboratory findings were as follows: WBC 9.7 +/- 3.9 x 10(3)/microliter (mean +/- SD, p < 0.02 vs normal control), Hb 17.9 +/- 4.2 g/dl (p < 0.001), Plt 39.7 +/- 26.0 x 10(4)/microliter, EPO 13.8 +/- 5.2 mU/ml (p < 0.0001), NAP score 258 +/- 114, Vit. B12 1,686 +/- 2,156 pg/ml, arterial O2 saturation more than 92% in all cases. The diagnosis of all cases was polycythemia vera according to the diagnostic criteria of Polycythemia Vera Study Group. Associated conditions included 8 cases of thrombosis (cerebral thrombosis 4, thrombophrebitis 2, myocardial infarction 1, ischemic colitis 1) and 3 cases of malignancy (esophageal cancer 1, breast cancer 1, renal cancer 1), none of which was therapy-related cancer. Six patients (50%) had only phlebotomy, three (25%) only chemotherapy, and three (25%) both phlebotomy and chemotherapy. Patients over 80 years old needed neither intensive nor continuous treatment. Only one patient died due to esophageal cancer at age 89.
