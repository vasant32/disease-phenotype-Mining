OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the interventional thrombolysis for treatment of untravascular thrombus and disscuss the problems of its clinical use. METHODS: 18 patients with intravascular occlusive disease were treated with pulsed-spray thrombolysis(PST). The concentration of urokinase was 10,000 U/ml. The dose of urokinase was 10,000 U/min, the total dose was from 300,000 U to 800,000 U, and the average dose was 380,000 U. RESULTS: In 18 cases, 14 were obtained thrombolysis completely(77.8%), the cases of thrombolysis partly and unaffected were 2(11.1%) and 2(11.1%) in number respectively. The mean time of thrombolysis was 2.8 hours. CONCLUSION: The treatment of thrombolysis is highly beneficial to the patients with intravascular occlusive disease.
