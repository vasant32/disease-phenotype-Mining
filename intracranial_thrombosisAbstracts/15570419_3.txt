We report the cases of three patients diagnosed with dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) and cortical venous reflux (CVR). All were treated by transarterial endovascular embolization. Residual shunting and cortical venous drainage continued to be present at the end of the treatment procedure, despite the fact that during endovascular embolization glue penetration into the proximal venous component of the fistula had been achieved. Subsequently, follow-up angiography showed total obliteration of the fistulas and absent associated CVR. The fistulas were no longer opacified, and no additional treatment was performed. We demonstrate that residual aggressive DAVF may progress to total thrombosis if strategic deposition of the glue into the venous side has been achieved. Early follow-up angiogram is recommended prior to a planned complementary surgical approach.
