We report the case of a 4-year-old male with vertebrobasilar artery thrombosis for which he was treated with local intra-arterial urokinase 60 hours after onset of symptoms. Initially the patient had dysarthria and dysphagia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a community hospital showed abnormalities in the pons, and vertebrobasilar artery thrombosis was suspected. The patient was transferred to the university hospital because of neurological deterioration. Just before thrombolysis, his physical examination revealed a downward ocular deviation, stretching of the arms, and spontaneous movements of the legs. Brain MRI showed recent ischaemia in the pons and caudal part of the mesencephalon, and magnetic resonance angiography showed occlusion of the basilar artery. Intra-arterial thrombolysis with urokinase (total dose 36 000U/kg) was performed 60 hours after onset of symptoms. After thrombolysis he was treated with heparin for 10 days, followed by aspirin. The patient recovered well. After 1 year he had only minor ataxia and performed all activities at school. Local vasculitis due to an infection with Borrelia burgdorferi was thought to be the cause of the local thrombosis. A review of the literature revealed 11 other case reports of successful local intra-arterial thrombolysis in children and adolescents with ischaemic stroke. This suggests that intra-arterial thrombolysis is feasible and safe in selected paediatric patients with ischaemic stroke.
