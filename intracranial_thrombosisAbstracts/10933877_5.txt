Heme oxygenase-1, an inducible heat shock protein, is upregulated by oxidative stress, and its expression is modulated by proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-6. In the present study, we investigated the effects of postlesional, orally applied ebselen, a neuroprotective antioxidant, on serum levels of IL-6 and cerebral heme oxygenase-1 expression following focal ischemia induced by photothrombosis. Ebselen (50 mg/kg body weight) was given 30 min postlesion to male Wistar rats. Animals were divided into four groups: sham-operated vehicle control (n = 9), sham-operated ebselen control (n = 8), lesioned vehicle control (n = 14), and lesioned ebselen-treated (n = 17). Ebselen treatment resulted in a significant lowering of IL-6 plasma levels (26 +/- 5 pg/ml) as compared with that seen in lesioned vehicle controls (48 +/- 9 pg/ml) at 24 h postlesion. In sham-operated rats IL-6 was not detectable. Heme oxygenase-1-positive glial cells were quantitated within topographically determined perilesional brain regions. Within the 0.5-mm-wide rim region directly associated with the lesion core, no differences in the amount of heme oxygenase-1-positive glial cells were found. However, in the more remote ipsilateral perilesional cortex, significantly fewer heme oxygenase-1-positive glial cells were present within the supragranular cortical layers of lesioned ebselen-treated rats compared to lesioned vehicle controls (P < 0.001). In sham-operated rats, no glial heme oxygenase-1 induction occurred. The results indicate that postlesional ebselen treatment lowered plasma IL-6 levels subsequent to a photothrombotic lesion concomitant with a lowering of the heme oxygenase-1 response in glial cells.
