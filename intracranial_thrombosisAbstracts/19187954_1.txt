INTRODUCTION: Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a rare presentation of venous thrombosis and has been associated with many conditions. In about 20% no risk factor is identified. The aim of this study was to assess the clot formation by thromboelastography (TEG) in patients with a history of CVT compared with healthy controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TEG analysis was performed on recalcified blood samples of 19 CVT patients from a single centre cohort and 1:1 sex/ age (+/-3 year) matched controls. Four TEG parameters were monitored: reaction time (r) to clot initiation, time to reach a 20 mm level of clot formation (K), slope angle alpha from r to K (alpha) and maximum vertical amplitude (MA). Patients were tested for thrombophilic defects, including deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C and protein S, factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A mutation, lupus anticoagulant, antiphospholipid antibodies, and high factor VIII levels. RESULTS: Thrombophilia testing identified a prothrombotic abnormality in 11 patients (58%). Sixteen patients (84%) had one or more transient risk factor. There were no significant differences in TEG parameters between CVT patients and controls, neither between the subgroup of patients with a thrombophilic defect and controls. Seven of all patients (37%), including 5 patients with abnormal thrombophilia testing, and 5 controls (26%) had one or more TEG hypercoagulable parameters. CONCLUSIONS: A persistent hypercoagulable state which could have predisposed to venous thrombosis in CVT patients and in the subgroup of patients with a thrombophilic defect could not be demonstrated by TEG.
