Polycythemia in CAPD patients has been rarely described. Over an eight year period, 4 out of 123 CAPD patients (3%) were identified as having Hct values exceeding 50% for 1 month or longer. All of the 4 patients were insulin dependent diabetics (4/47 diabetic patients, 8.5%). Charts were reviewed on 3 of these 4 patients. Polycythemia developed after a mean of 21 +/- 7 months on peritoneal dialysis. Prior to the development of polycythemia, ferritin levels were low and ferrous sulfate therapy was begun at a time the Hct values were 36 to 40%. Erythropoietin levels were obtained in 2 patients, and were 22 U/L (Hct 51%) and less than 5 U/L (Hct 55%). Renal ultrasound failed to show renal masses or cysts. One patient had a plasma volume of 2.1 L (normal 2.4-3.2 L); another patient was clinically volume depleted. Complications during the period of polycythemia included gangrenous feet requiring amputation in 2 patients, CVA in 2 patients, and splenic infarct in 1 patient. One patient died of cerebral thrombosis. We conclude that polycythemia is uncommon in CAPD patients and occurs most often in diabetic patients. Volume depletion and iron therapy may play a role in its etiology. In this high risk group of patients polycythemia may contribute to vascular complications and should be avoided.
