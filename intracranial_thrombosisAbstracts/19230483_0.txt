Surgical technique of endoaneurysmal thrombectomy in microsurgical treatment of giant partially thrombosed cerebral aneurysms is described. The suggested method implies removal of thrombotic masses using the same technique as in endarterectomy. The goal of this manipulation is clipping of aneurysm neck with reconstruction of affected artery during a shortened time. All stages are described and illustrated in details. Authors applied this technique in 9 patients with giant partially thrombosed aneurysm of different localization. Bloodflow cessation period varied from 4 to 12 minutes (mean--6 minutes), which was significantly shorter than in thrombectomy using CUSA. No mortality and ischemic complications were observed in our series.
