To evaluate the clinical implications of soluble thrombomodulin and lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] in patients with cerebral thrombosis, these parameters were measured in the plasma of 28 patients with cerebral thrombosis within 3 days of onset, 36 with cerebral thrombosis more than 1 month after onset, six with cerebral hemorrhage more than 3 months after onset and 37 healthy volunteers. In the patients with chronic-phase cerebral thrombosis, the thrombomodulin and Lp(a) levels were significantly higher and the total cholesterol level was significantly lower than in the normal group, while the patients with acute-phase cerebral thrombosis had significantly lower total cholesterol levels. The plasma level of Lp(a) in acute-phase cerebral thrombosis, but not that of thrombomodulin, was significantly higher in thromboses located in the cortex area and in patients with recurrent attacks than in the normal controls. There were no significant differences in thrombomodulin, Lp(a) or total cholesterol levels between the chronic-phase cerebral hemorrhage and normal groups. These findings support the hypothesis that Lp(a) plays a part as a risk factor in cerebral thrombosis, especially in patients with a cortex area thrombosis and in patients with a recurrent attack. The high levels of thrombomodulin in the chronic-phase cerebral thrombosis group suggests the presence of continuous endothelial cell damage.
