The established indication for Tc99m apcitide scintigraphy is for detecting deep venous thrombosis. However, due to its mechanism of binding to GP IIb/IIIa receptors on activated platelets, it can be used to image acute cerebral thrombosis. I report a patient with an acute ischaemic stroke, with right leg swelling, referred for Tc99m apcitide scintigraphy to show of deep venous thrombosis. There was no abnormal uptake in the legs but there was in the left parieto-occipital region. This correlated with the clinical and CT data, indicating an acute ischaemic stroke in this area.
