1. An extract of Ginkgo biloba (EGb 761) has been reported to alleviate cerebrovascular problems. In the present study, we investigated the antithrombotic effects of EGb 761 in cerebral blood vessels of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP/Izm). 2. In the present study, EGb 761 was administered orally to SHRSP/Izm at 60 and 120 mg/kg each day for 3 weeks from the age of 7 weeks. The age-related increase in blood pressure observed in SHRSP was suppressed significantly by EGb 761 at both doses 3 weeks after treatment. 3. Thrombotic potential was assessed in vivo using a He-Ne laser-induced thrombosis model and was significantly suppressed by EGb 761. 4. The anti-oxidant effects of EGb 761 were determined by measurement of urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). At 120 mg/kg, EGb 761 decreased 8-OHdG significantly compared with control animals. 5. Urinary nitrite/nitrate, nitric oxide (NO) metabolites, were increased significantly after administration of EGb 761. Expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) mRNA was measured using a real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method. The expression of eNOS mRNA in the EGb 761 group (120 mg/kg) was significantly higher than in the control group. 6. The results indicate that EGb 761 decreases blood pressure and mediates strong antithrombotic and anti-oxidant effects in SHRSP. These pharmacological activities may contribute to the beneficial properties of EGb 761 observed in clinical practice.
