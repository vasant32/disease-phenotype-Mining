One hundred and one patients below 45 years and showing objective signs of cerebral ischemia were studied retrospectively for pathogenic factors. Twelve were below 15 years; the male to female ratio was 1:1. Factors known as predisposing (heart disease, hypertension, hyperlipemia, diabetes mellitus or infectious diseases) and other possible factors (e.g. trauma, abuse) were found in 41 patients. Among women using contraceptive pills there might be an increased risk of development of cerebral thrombosis, but the material was not large enough to warrant statistical analysis. In 64 patients one or more abnormal coagulation values were found, the most frequent being a deficient vessel wall fibrinolysis, which was noted in 38%. We therefore consider it worthwhile to investigate the fibrinolytic defence mechanism of the vessel wall in patients with cerebral thrombosis, since it is possible to treat this condition with specific fibrinolytic stimulating agents.
