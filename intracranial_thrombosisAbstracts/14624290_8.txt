BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ischemia/reperfusion generates free oxygen radicals, which react with the unsaturated lipids of biomembranes resulting in the generation products such as malondialdehyde. Malondialdehyde could be a sensor for tissue damage and reperfusion. Nitric oxide, released due to the early arrival of leukocytes in the brain parenchyma, could be a sensor for nonflow phenomenon. Thereby, the purpose of this research was to evaluate the behavior of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide within the 24 hours after the stroke onset. METHODS: Fifteen patients up to an age of 49 years, admitted to the emergency of University Hospital and Chiquinquir√° Hospital in Maracaibo, Venezuela, were examined by a neurologist and underwent 12-lead electrocardiograms and computed tomography for the diagnosis of thrombotic stroke. Serum malondialdehyde and nitric oxide were measured as thiobarbituric acid adducts and total nitrites. Data were collected within the 24 hours after the stroke onset. RESULTS: Malondialdehyde for patients with stroke had a significant increase (P<0.001) when compared with healthy controls (47.9 +/- 7.1 vs. 1.7 +/- 0.2 micromol/L). Conversely, serum nitric oxide for patients with stroke had a significant decrease (P<0.001) when compared with the control group (14.5 +/- 1.4 vs. 41.3 +/- 3.7 micromol/L). The lowest values of malondialdehyde and the highest values of nitric oxide were observed in two patients, who died. CONCLUSIONS: Serum levels of malondialdehyde increase, and serum levels of nitric oxide diminish within 24 hours after the onset of thrombotic stroke onset. This suggests that serum malondialdehyde level could be used as potentially reliable and sensitive marker for reperfusion, whereas nitric oxide levels could acts as potential biochemical sensor for nonreflow phenomenon.
