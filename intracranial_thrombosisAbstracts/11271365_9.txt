This investigation analyzed the potential of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a field strength of 7T to depict leukocyte infiltration and glial responses after focal cerebral ischemia induced by photothrombotic occlusion of cerebral microvessels. For this purpose we superimposed multiparametric MRI (apparent diffusion coefficient, T2, perfusion-weighted, and gadolinium-DTPA-enhanced T1-weighted imaging) on tissue sections stained for phagocytes and astrocytes and, moreover, assessed the regional distribution of tissue pH and ATP content by invasive biochemical methods. Comparing the histological data with the various MRI parameters, high-resolution MRI did not allow a spatial discrimination between distinct areas of phagocyte accumulation or astroglial scar formation, based on image contrast or even quantitative parameter value differences. However, MRI parameters underwent characteristic changes and differentiated distinct stages of tissue remodeling between days 3 and 14 after photothrombosis. Low apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and high T2 values indicated an early stage (3 days) with necrosis and beginning glial activation. Normal ADC and reduced T2 elevation characterized an infarct with advanced glial activation and infiltration of hematogenous cells at 7 days after photothrombosis. Heterogeneous ADC together with T2 elevation reflected a late infarct stage (14 days) when pseudocystic degeneration and scar formation had occurred.
