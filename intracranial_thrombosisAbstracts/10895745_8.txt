A retrospective survey of anaesthesia for Caesarean section (CS) for placenta praevia was performed, covering the period between January 1, 1984 and December 31, 1998. Three hundred and fifty consecutive cases of placenta praevia were identified. Overall a regional technique was used 60% of the time. Five women had a placenta accreta which required Caesarean hysterectomy: one had general anaesthesia (GA) throughout and four initially received a single-shot spinal injection. Of these latter four cases, two were converted to GA during the hysterectomy and two continued with spinal anaesthesia throughout. Two other women (both GA), suffered postoperative thrombotic episodes (one pulmonary embolus and one cerebral thrombosis) but made full recoveries. Control of blood pressure when using regional anaesthesia (RA), even in the presence of considerable haemorrhage, was not a problem. Statistical regression models indicated that RA was associated with a significantly reduced estimated blood loss and reduced need for blood transfusion. This retrospective survey finds no data to support the much quoted aphorism that RA is contraindicated for CS in the presence of placenta praevia.
