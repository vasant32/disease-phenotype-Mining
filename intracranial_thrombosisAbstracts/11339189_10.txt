OBJECTIVE: To assess the sonographic findings and clinical implications of fetal thrombosis of dural sinuses. DESIGN: Retrospective study of cases with a prenatal diagnosis of thrombosis of the dural sinuses. RESULTS: The diagnosis of fetal thrombosis of the dural sinuses was established in three uncomplicated pregnancies at 21, 22 and 28 weeks' gestation by transabdominal and transvaginal sonography, demonstrating a blood clot within the dilated dural sinuses, always in the region of the torcular Herophilii. The diagnosis was further confirmed by the color Doppler demonstration of absence of blood flow within the dilated dural sinuses. Upon request of the couples two pregnancies were terminated. One infant was delivered at term by Cesarean section and died during neurosurgery. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombosis of the cerebral venous circulation can occur antenatally. Accurate diagnosis can be made using fetal real-time and color Doppler ultrasound.
