OBJECTIVE: To determine whether pretreatment markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis are related to recanalization and functional outcome. METHODS: The authors included patients treated with IV rt-PA with occlusion on baseline transcranial Doppler (Thrombolysis in Brain Ischemia [TIBI] criteria) in whom recanalization within 6 hours was monitored. At baseline, the authors recorded data about demographics, vascular risk factors, the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, early CT signs, etiology, blood glucose, and time to rt-PA. The authors also measured plasmatic markers of coagulation (fibrinogen, prothrombin fragments 1 + 2, Factor XIII, Factor VII) and fibrinolysis (alpha2-antiplasmin, Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor, Functional Thrombin Activatable Fibrinolysis Inhibitor [fTAFI]). A favorable outcome was defined as a modified Rankin score < 2 at 3 months. RESULTS: The authors studied 63 patients with a mean age of 67.3 +/- 12.5 years. The median NIHSS score was 16. Patients who recanalized had lower concentrations of alpha2-antiplasmin (87.5 +/- 18% vs 96.5 +/- 12.5%, p = 0.023) and fTAFI (91.7 +/- 26.7% vs 104.4 +/- 21%, p = 0.039). A multivariant logistic regression analysis showed that the level of alpha2-antiplasmin was the only predictive variable of recanalization (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91, 0.99, p = 0.038), while the NIHSS score was the only predictive variable of functional outcome (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.72, 0.92, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Baseline levels of alpha2-antiplasmin were predictive of recanalization but were not related to the long-term outcome in patients treated with rt-PA within the first 3 hours.
