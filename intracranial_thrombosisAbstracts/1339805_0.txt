It is sometimes very difficult to diagnose dissecting aortic aneurysms (DAA), particularly in its early stage, due to manifold signs and symptoms. The purpose of this study is to clarify the reasons for such erroneous diagnoses. A total of 41 patients with DAA were referred to our hospitals for further examination and/or surgery from April 1986 to August 1989. In 18 of these patients, the diagnostic possibility of an underlying DAA was overlooked by the referring physicians. Among these 18 patients, 2 were mistakenly diagnosed as uncomplicated myocardial infarction (MI), one as pneumonia, 2 as cerebral infarction, 6 as acute abdominal disease, one as cholelithiasis, 5 as thrombosis of the lower extremities, and one as malignant metastasis to the pericardium. The following is the detail: In 2 cases thought to be uncomplicated MI, an expanding dissecting ascending aorta had crushed the lumen of the left coronary artery, causing MI, in turn, wasting clinical treatment and consuming precious time. In one case, enlargement of the descending aorta on the chest radiography was overlooked and the patient's symptoms were mistakenly attributed to pneumonia. In 2 cases in which symptoms of cerebral ischemia were thought to be attributed to cerebral thrombosis, the real cause turned out to be occlusion of the brachiocephalic artery following aortic dissection. Among 6 cases which were initially considered to have only acute abdominal disease, 3 presented with symptoms and signs of ileus, and their exploratory laparotomies yielded no positive findings.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
