The palatal lift prosthesis is used to alleviate rhinopharyngeal closure dysfunction. It is generally problematical to use in edentulous patients, because the palatal lift prosthesis requires secure retention of the denture base and is difficult for the patient to retain while eating. This article describes the fabrication of a complete denture with a removable palatal lift prosthesis and a clinical evaluation of the denture's stability. A sprue pin and tube were used as a connecting attachment between the removable palatal lift prosthesis and the denture base. The force required for lifting the soft palate and the denture's stability were measured in the clinical evaluation. The prosthesis required an average retentive force of 0.26 N for each 1 mm of soft palate lift. The force required to dislodge the denture was measured with and without the palatal lift prosthesis in place. The force required to dislodge the conventional complete dentures of five healthy individuals was also measured as a reference. The denture was 24.4% less stable when the palatal lift prosthesis was in place and was generally easier to dislodge than were conventional dentures. This denture with a removable palatal lift prosthesis is useful for patients with dysfunction of the soft palate involving hypernasal speech who have difficulty in retaining the prosthesis while eating.
