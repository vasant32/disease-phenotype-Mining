BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous thromboses (CVT) with distinct clinical presentations have been shown worldwide. However, there is little information regarding race-ethnic differences in this disease. METHODS: We prospectively studied 50 CVT patients from Brazil, comparing clinical and laboratory data among white (W) and African-Brazilian (AB) patients. RESULTS: Seventy percent of the patients were female, 26 W and 23 AB, mean age 34.7 years. Multiple sinus CVT, deep CVT and worse outcome were significantly more frequent in AB than in W patients. There was a trend towards a higher frequency of factor V Leiden and prothrombin mutation in W than in AB, and of protein C deficiency in AB. CONCLUSIONS: CVT was more severe in AB patients than in W patients. Race-ethnic differences may account for the heterogeneous distribution of inherited thrombophilia in this series.
