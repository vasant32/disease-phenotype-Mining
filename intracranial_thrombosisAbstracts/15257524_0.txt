INTRODUCTION: Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is an infrequent process in systemic lupus erythematosus. We report the case of a female patient whose initial manifestation of lupus was a CVT. CASE REPORT: A 30-year-old female who presented headaches and diminished visual acuity; on exploring the patient bilateral papilloedema was found. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed the presence of a venous thrombosis in the superior and transversal longitudinal sinus. Complementary explorations showed high levels of antinuclear antibodies with leukopenia and proteinuria. Antiphospholipid antibodies were negative. Following treatment with anticoagulants, the patient's condition improved both clinically and radiologically. Months later a biopsy was performed and revealed a grade IV diffuse glomerulonephritis. CONCLUSIONS: In systemic lupus erythematosus, phenomena such as CVT can be the initial form of presentation of the disease. The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies plays a partial role in CVT; other phenomena, such as inflammatory processes, should also be taken into account.
