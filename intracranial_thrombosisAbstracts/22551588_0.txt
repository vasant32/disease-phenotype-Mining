Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare complication of traumatic head injury. Here we present a patient with traumatic extradural haematoma successfully evacuated with good clinical recovery. However, the patient then deteriorated and died. The cause, at post mortem, was a propagating CVST, sustained at the time of head injury. CVST, although rare, is therefore an important cause of deterioration in traumatic head injury. This patient with CVST is unique in that CVST was not considered as a diagnosis in the face of more obvious pathology and was responsible for late deterioration. We discuss the potential difficulties in both the detection and management of such a complication, particularly in association with extradural haematoma.
