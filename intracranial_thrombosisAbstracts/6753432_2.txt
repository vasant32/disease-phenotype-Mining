Low anterior resection for carcinoma in the mid- and lower third of the rectum has been performed with autosuture technique, using the EEA autosuture stapling instrument in 38 patients, 26 with carcinoma, 10 with diverticulitis, and 2 with Crohn's disease. In 16 patients the anastomotic line was 4-6 cm above the anal verge, and in 22 patients 7-12 cm above the anal verge. Thirty-two patients (80%) had an uneventful postoperative course. Four patients had complications: one, with leakage from a very low-seated anastomosis, was treated with an abdominoperineal resection; 2 had temporary transversostomy performed due to minor anastomotic leakage; and 1 patient developed a fistula, which closed spontaneously. Two patients died, 1 from pulmonary embolism, 1 from cerebral thrombosis. The EEA stapling instrument seems safe, and approximately 42% of the patients in this material would formerly have been subjected to abdominoperineal resection and permanent colostomy.
