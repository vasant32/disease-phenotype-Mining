A 47-year-old man with a history of thrombophlebitis of his left leg for several years presented with a mild left hemiparesis and ipsilateral hypesthesia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed subacute thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus and a cortical vein of the right cerebral hemisphere. A linear hyperintense area was found in the white matter of the right postcentral gyrus on T 2- and diffusion weighted axial imagings on the 7 days after the onset. The patient was treated conservatively, and his clinical course was uneventful. His neurological dysfunctions recovered within approximately three weeks after the onset. The white matter lesion in the right postcentral gyrus also disappeared one month later. The apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) in the white matter of the pre- and postcentral gyrus were measured bilaterally on the ADC mapping imaging. In the subacute stage, the ADC values in the white matter of the right pre- and postcentral gyrus were 0.50 x 10(-3) mm2/sec and 0.91 x 10(-3) mm2/sec, respectively. The %ADC indicating the ratio of ADC value of the lesion to that of the contralateral brain tissue was calculated. The %ADCs in the white matter of the pre- and postcentral gyrus were 64.9% and 124.5% respectively. In the chronic stage, the ADC values in the white matter of the right pre- and postcentral gyrus were 0.96 x 10(-3) mm2/sec and 0.99 x 10(-3) mm2/sec, and the %ADCs improved to 106.7% and 106.5% respectively. The lesions in the white matter of the right pre- and postcentral gyrus were reversible. The former was thought to be mainly ascribed to cellular edema and the latter was vasogenic edema. The present case showed when %ADC of the ischemic lesion in cerebral venous thrombosis was higher than 60%-70%, conservative therapy alone is sufficient effective for the improvement of neurological deficits.
