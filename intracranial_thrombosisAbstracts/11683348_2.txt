We analyzed 143 cases of skull base surgery collected from the eight institutions of the Study Group supported by the Grant-in-Aid for Cancer Research from the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan. Histologically, the most common type was squamous cell carcinoma (n = 78), which was followed by olfactory neuroblastoma (n = 16) and adenoid cystic carcinoma (n = 16). The most frequent surgical approach was frontal craniotomy (n = 66), followed by front-temporal craniotomy (n = 54) and infratemporal fossa approach (n = 8). For repair of dura matter, fascia lata was used in 37 cases. galeopericranial flap in 35 and temporal muscle fascia in 16. The 5-year survival rate by Kaplan-Meier method of nose and paranasal sinus carcinoma (n = 119) was 48%. As for histological classification, the survival rates were both 65%) in adenoid cystic carcinoma (n = 12) and bone soft tissue malignancy (n = 10), 62% in olfactory neuroblastoma (n = 16), 46% in squamous cell carcinoma (n = 62) and 33% in adenocarcinoma (n = 11). All the three cases of malignant melanoma died within 1 year, so we considered skull base surgery to be contraindicated for this disease. Complications were observed in 62 out of the 143 cases (43%); local infection was most frequent in 29 cases. liquorrhea in 18, abscess in 16, necrosis of the flap and meningitis in ten cases, DIC in four, rupture of the internal carotid artery in two and cerebral thrombosis in one. Death caused directly by surgery was in ten cases (7%). It is important that a multi-center registry be maintained to have a large enough database for comparison of results, and prognosis for each histological entity and further define the role of multidisciplinary treatment.
