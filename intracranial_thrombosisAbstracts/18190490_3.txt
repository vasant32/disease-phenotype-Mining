We report 2 patients with angiographically demonstrated basilar artery thrombosis who received emergent intra-arterial thrombolysis with successful recanalization of the basilar artery. In the ensuing weeks after the procedure, both patients were in a locked-in state and had sustained large bilateral regions of pontine ischemia on brain imaging. Following aggressive supportive care and rehabilitation, outcomes obtained prospectively revealed that both patients made a remarkable recovery, becoming fully independent with Barthel scores of 20 and modified Rankin scores of 2.
