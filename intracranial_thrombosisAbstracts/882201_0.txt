The authors analysed clinically 108 patients (61 males and 47 females), aged below 50 years treated at the department of neurology, because of acute cerebral ischaemia. Attention is called to risk factors such as arterial hypertension, heart disease, atherosclerosis, obesity and diabetes which may be the cause of earlier development of ischaemic changes in the central nervous system. In the analysed group in 18 cases cerebral thrombosis, in 23 cases embolism, in 31 cerebral circulatory failure were diagnosed. In 36 cases the cause could not have been established.
