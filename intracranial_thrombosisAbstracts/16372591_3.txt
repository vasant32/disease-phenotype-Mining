Cerebral venous thrombosis is an unusual condition characterized by headache, nausea, vomiting, focal deficits and epileptic seizures. In this case report we describe a patient who presented with headache and focal motor deficits after an uneventful Caesarean section, performed using combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed because of the pronounced neurological symptoms, and a diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis was made. The patient was treated with anticoagulant agents and made a complete recovery. This case emphasizes the importance of considering cerebral venous thrombosis in the differential diagnosis of headache in the post-partum period prior to instituting conventional therapy.
