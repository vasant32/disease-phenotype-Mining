Although the common 4G/5G polymorphism in the promoter of the PAI-1 gene was suggested to be a risk factor for some of the thrombotic disorders, its significance in the development of thrombosis is still controversial. This study presents the data on a total of 357 patients with different types of thrombosis and 281 unrelated healthy controls. It was found that the 4G/4G genotype is associated with a higher risk of thrombosis (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.5). Patients were divided into five distinct groups according to the site of thrombosis. Both 4G/4G and 4G/5G genotypes were associated with a higher risk of thrombosis development in a group of 69 patients with internal organ thrombosis (OR, 6.35; 95% CI, 2.5-16.1 and OR, 4.85; 95% CI, 2.0-12.1, respectively). Interestingly, this association was even stronger in a subgroup of 33 patients with portal vein thrombosis (PVT) and 4G/4G and 4G/5G genotypes conferred more than 10- and 6-fold increases in the risk of developing PVT (95% CI: 2.3-47.1 and 1.4-28.8), respectively. No statistically significant association was found between 4G/4G genotype and the groups of deep vein thrombosis (126 patients), cerebral thrombosis (80 patients), retinal thrombosis (72 patients), and purpura fulminans (16 patients). Factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A mutations did not emerge as additional risk factors for thrombosis in any of the groups studied. To conclude, this study suggests that there may be an association between 4G/4G and 4G/5G genotypes and the thrombosis in vessels of internal organs especially in the portal veins.
