Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a relatively rare condition caused by multiple etiologies, usually secondary to hypercoagulable states. The optimal treatment is controversial, especially in the presence of hemorrhagic infarcts. We describe an unusual patient with extensive CVT associated with moderate hyperhomocyst(e)inemia who was aggressively treated with chemical and mechanical thrombolysis with an excellent outcome.
