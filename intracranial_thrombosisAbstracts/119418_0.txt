The cerebral thrombosis of the rat with 35 micrometer labeled microspheres gives infarcted areas easily seen. After 15 min, in these areas, there is no change in NADH diaphorase-, succinic-dehydrogenase-, mono-amino-oxidase-, glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-, isocitric dehydrogenase-, lactic-dehydrogenase-, ATPase, alpha galactosidase-, acid phospatase activity. After 2, 4, 6 h all these activities diminish in the neuropil but they are preserved in the neurones for diaphorase, succinic-dehydrogenase and mono-amino-oxidase. The margin of infarcted areas shows a strong staining for acid phosphatase. Before 2 h there is not enzymatic changes neither oedema. This experimental model seems trustly and could be developped.
