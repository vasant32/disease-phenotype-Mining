Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a vascular disease with many clinical manifestations and possible etiologies (local, systemic or idiopathic). Galen vein thrombosis (GVT) is a rare cause of CVT and usually it is associated with some vascular malformation. We report a case of a 16 years old female patient with GVT without vascular malformation, but associated with straight sinus thrombosis and venous thalamic infarct. Relevant aspects of the clinical, radiological and laboratory diagnosis of CVT are also discussed.
