Small amounts of alcohol were held to be beneficial in the 19th century, but the idea died out. Scientific evidence that moderate amounts prolonged life, published in 1926, was ignored. Further evidence accumulated from the early 1950s but the belief that alcohol was only harmful had become so ingrained that the idea has been taken seriously only since the early 1980s. Now, the evidence that small amounts reduce the risk of vascular disease by about a third and reduce total mortality in middle and old age is massive. Alternative explanations for the observed inverse relationships have been ruled out and beneficial effects have been shown to be biologically plausible. The reduction in mortality is mainly attributable to ischaemic heart disease and cerebral thrombosis, but some other diseases may also contribute to it. The increasing mortality with larger amounts is attributable to many causes that have long been recognized. The optimum level varies with sex and age and may be zero under about age 45 years. The benefit is directly due to ethanol and the extra benefit attributed to wine is due to the pattern of drinking. Public policy needs to take account of medical and social effects other than mortality and will vary in different communities depending on background patterns of injury and disease.
