This study was conducted to clarify the relationship between long-term prognosis of functional status after stroke and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings as well as complications in the course. A total of 98 patients with initial cerebral thrombosis were enrolled, and 65 patients surviving 5 years after the event, were studied in terms of cognitive function and activity of daily living (ADL). Mean age at registration (3 months after the event) was 72.0 years-old and 44 were male. MRI findings were divided into eight categories including the size and laterality of infarction, in addition to six categories as previously described. The presence of dementia was identified according to the HDS-R and the DSM-III-R scales, and the extent of dementia, assessed with the CDR scale, was divided into 3 grades: none, mild, and severe. The extent of ADL status was also graded into 3 classes: independent, partially dependent, and completely dependent. Recurrence of stroke, pneumonia, and motor disorders (hip joint fracture) were counted as complications during the course. At baseline, dementia was identified in 44, consisting of 30 mild and 14 severe dementias. During 5 years, 11 cases with mild dementia showed deterioration, and 1 case without dementia developed mild dementia. At registration, there were 46 cases with partially dependent ADL status and 22 cases completely dependent, while deterioration of ADL was seen in 17 during 5 years. Multiple regression analyses showed that diffuse PVH and pneumonia were contributory factors to the development of dementia, while dementia, pneumonia and motor disorders were risk factors for deterioration of ADL. These findings suggested that in patients with cerebral thrombosis, especially in patients with diffuse PVH, pneumonia and motor disorders should be taken care of in order to prevent functional decline.
