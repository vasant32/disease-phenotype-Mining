Vein of Galen aneurysm is a rare pathology, representing less than 1% of intracranial vascular malformations. We report on a 65-year-old man who experienced a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Brain imaging showed a large calcified expanding mass in the pineal region, confirming the diagnosis of a vein of Galen aneurysm. Because of the spontaneous thrombosis of the malformation, there was no need for microsurgical or endovascular treatment and he has been regularly followed since that.
