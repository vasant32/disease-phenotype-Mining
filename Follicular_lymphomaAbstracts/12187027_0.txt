A 55-year-old man suffered a cutaneous relapse of an LMP1-positive follicular lymphoma after treatment with antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine A (CSA) for a hepatitis-associated aplastic anaemia (AA). Rituximab was not effective, so CSA was tapered off. Lymphoma masses did not regress but AA relapsed. A second remission of both lymphoma and AA was achieved with high-dose cyclophosphamide, but the patient died of a bilateral pneumonia. The relationships between immunosuppression, viral reactivation and tumour growth are discussed. The use of rituximab and lamivudine in immunodepressed patients is also commented.
