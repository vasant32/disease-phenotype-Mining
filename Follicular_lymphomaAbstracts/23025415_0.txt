 CONCLUSION: Most hematolymphoid malignancies in the head and neck were malignant lymphomas that most often occurred in sexagenarian men. Approximately 80% of them were B-cell lymphomas with a predominance of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in both nodal and extranodal sites. Our results were compatible with those in a previous study that was conducted in the central part of Japan. OBJECTIVES: This analysis was performed to describe the anatomic distribution of hematolymphoid malignancies that were diagnosed by biopsy in our department. METHODS: Clinical medical records of 122 patients with hematolymphoid malignancies in the head and neck from January 2004 to December 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. The anatomic site of origin according to the histopathology of each malignancy was analyzed. RESULTS: The incidence ratio of hematolymphoid malignancies was 15.1%. The male:female ratio was 2.3:1. Ages ranged from 17 to 89 years (median, 66). Of the 122 cases, 121 were lymphoid neoplasms (4 cases of Hodgkin lymphoma and 117 cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma) and the remaining 1 was myeloid. The most common histopathology was DLBCL (54.9%), followed by follicular lymphoma (8.2%), and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (8.2%). Most commonly, the oropharynx (36.1%) and the cervical lymph node (34.4%) were affected.
