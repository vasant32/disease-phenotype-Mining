 BACKGROUND: Myelopathy due to epidural spinal cord compression is rare in patients with malignant lymphoma and most of these patients are diagnosed with high-grade lymphoma. An epidural growth of low-grade lymphoma is even more unusual. Due to this low incidence, therapeutic experience for this entity is limited. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report the outcome of 3 consecutive patients with primary spinal epidural follicular lymphoma (FL). Due to the clinical disorders of the patients and despite the localized disease, we used an intensive multimodal therapy concept consisting of spinal decompression, systemic (immuno)chemotherapy and local irradiation. All patients improved in their medical condition; 2 achieved a complete remission, 1 of these with long-term remission. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the established irradiation therapy for early-stage FL, an intensive multimodal therapy concept should be initiated in patients with primary spinal epidural FL. With this approach, a fast improvement of the symptoms and long-term disease-free survival is possible.
