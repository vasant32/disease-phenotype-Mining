Mitochondria are central to a variety of cellular processes, from metabolism to cell death. In this study, we demonstrated that an increase in the critical mitochondrial protein, cytochrome c, correlated with drug resistance in a cell culture model of aggressive lymphoma. Increased cytochrome c expression was also correlated with decreased survival in the aggressive diffuse large B-cell and mantle cell lymphomas, but not in the indolent follicular lymphoma. This suggests that an increased reliance on the mitochondria for energy allows tumor cells to be metabolic opportunists and contribute to tumor development and drug resistance.
