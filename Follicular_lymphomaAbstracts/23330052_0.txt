A 69-year-old Japanese female was diagnosed with primary intestinal follicular lymphoma. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with high-definition imaging revealed not only the typical feature of whitish polyps of up to 2 mm in diameter in the duodenal second and third portions, but also more detailed morphology, such as enlarged whitish villi and tiny whitish depositions. These findings appeared to reflect the pathological structures; infiltration of lymphoma cells into the villi were probably seen as enlargement of the villi, and the formation of lymphoid follicles were shown as opaque white spots or tiny white depositions. Thus, the above features might contribute to the distinct diagnosis of intestinal follicular lymphoma. This case indicates that routine esophagogastroduodenoscopy can visualize microsurface structures, which can be pathognomonic and help to diagnose intestinal follicular lymphoma, even without magnifying endoscopy.
