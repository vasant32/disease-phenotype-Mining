Elevated expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins have been linked to a poor survival rate of patients with Follicular Lymphoma (FL). This prompted us to evaluate a very potent non-peptidic Small-Molecule Inhibitor (SMI) targeting Bcl-2 family proteins, Apogossypolone (ApoG2) using follicular small cleaved cell lymphoma cell line (WSU-FSCCL) and cell isolated from lymphoma patients. ApoG2 inhibited the growth of WSU-FSCCL significantly with a 50% growth inhibition of cells (IC50) of 109 nM and decreased cell number of fresh lymphoma cells. ApoG2 activated caspases-9, -3, and -8, and the cleavage of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and Apoptosis Inducing Factor (AIF). In the WSU-FSCCL-SCID xenograft model, ApoG2 showed a significant anti-lymphoma effect, with %ILS of 84% in the intravenous and 63% in intraperitoneal treated mice. These studies suggest that ApoG2 can be an effective therapeutic agent against FL.
