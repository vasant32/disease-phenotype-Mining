Double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) and video capsule endoscopy are useful for the diagnosis of lymphoma in the small intestine. However, DBE cannot be safely performed in cases with passage disturbance due to wall thickening and stenosis. Additionally, video capsule endoscopy cannot be performed in such cases because of the risk of retention. Here, we report 4 cases of primary follicular lymphoma of the gastrointestinal tract that could be detected using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET-CT). The endoscopic findings of these 4 cases included lesions with wall thickening, which comprised macroscopically clusters of nodules, dense clusters of whitish granules or small nodules, fold thickening and ulcers with irregular margins that occupied the whole lumen with edematous mucosa. All patients fulfilled the World Health Organization grade 1 criteria. (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET-CT can help predict the risks that may result from certain endoscopic examinations, such as DBE and video capsule endoscopy.
