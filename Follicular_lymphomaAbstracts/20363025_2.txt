B-cell lines of diverse neoplastic origin express the serotonin transporter (SERT/SLC6A4) and growth arrest in response to SERT-ligands, including the antidepressants chlomipramine and fluoxetine. Here we detail SLC6A4 transcript (Q-PCR) and protein (FACS) expression in primary cells from patients with: chronic lymphocytic leukaemia; mantle cell lymphoma; follicular lymphoma; Burkitt's lymphoma; and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The ability of the SERT-binding antidepressants to impact the growth of these cells when sustained on CD154-transfected fibroblasts was also determined. The results reveal a broad spectrum of primary B-cell malignancies expressing SLC6A4 with a proportion additionally displaying growth arrest on SERT-ligand exposure.
