The records of 49 patients with nodular histiocytic lymphomas (NH) who were treated from 1972 to 1985 in hospitals belonging to the JLRTG were retrospectively reviewed. The actuarial survival rate and relapse-free survival rate of all patients after 5 years were 55.0 and 51.3%, respectively. Twenty-one patients with stage I disease had a significantly better survival rate than did 12 patients with stage II disease (P less than 0.01). Without combination chemotherapy, all 15 patients with stage I NH treated by radiation therapy were in complete remission, and 14 of them remained alive and well. Among these 15 patients, no difference in relapse was observed between patients who received involved field irradiation (1 of 6) and those who received extended field irradiation (2 of 9). Patients with stage II or more NH should be treated with intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy, as are patients with diffuse histiocytic lymphoma (DH). However, involved field radiotherapy with careful follow-up observation may be the treatment of choice for patients with stage I NH, provided their tumors are not bulky.
