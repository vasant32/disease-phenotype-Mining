 BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to report long-term results of rituximab induction monotherapy in patients with low-tumor-burden follicular lymphoma (LTBFL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 49 first-line LTBFL patients who received weekly doses of rituximab (375 mg/m(2)), 46 have been followed with a long-term analysis of clinical and molecular responses. RESULTS: Best clinical response (at any staging within a year following treatment) was 80%, 24 (52%) patients had complete or unconfirmed complete response, 13 (28%) had partial response and 9 (20%) had stable or progressive disease. Of 31 patients having a positive bcl2-JH rearrangement, 15 (48%) became negative following treatment. After 83.9 months of follow-up (95% confidence interval 6.4-92.8 months), the median progression-free survival is 23.5 months and overall survival (OS) is 91.7%. Five patients died (one progression, one myelodysplasia, one diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and two solid tumors). Seven patients (15%) are progression-free including five who are bcl2 informative. No unexpected long-term adverse event has been observed. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of patients remain progression-free 7 years after a single 4-dose rituximab treatment in first-line LTBFL. The 7-year overall survivalOS is very high in this selected population of patients.
