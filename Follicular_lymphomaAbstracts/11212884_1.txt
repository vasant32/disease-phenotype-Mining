AIMS: Microarray technology has recently led to the identification of molecular prognostic subgroups in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. To determine the usefulness of ready made macroarrays as routine diagnostic tools in haematopathology, lymph node biopsies were analysed using a cDNA macroarray containing genes involved in apoptosis, including caspases. METHODS: Nine biopsy specimens were analysed using total frozen tissues: four samples of B cell follicular lymphoma, two of B cell diffuse large cell lymphoma, and three of non-neoplastic lymph nodes from benign lymphadenitis. Nine cell populations were sorted from fresh tissues: malignant B cells from two patients with follicular lymphoma and two with diffuse large cell lymphoma, reactive B cells from two benign lymph nodes, reactive T cells from one benign lymph node, and virgin (mantle zone) B cells and germinal centre B cells from benign tonsils. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) on paraffin wax sections was performed for the localisation of caspases 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9. RESULTS: In the clustered array data, sorted cells from samples sharing common histological lesions were grouped together, whereas the array/histology correlation was less satisfactory for tissues. The expression profiles of both the array and IHC methods correlated for most caspases and samples. CONCLUSIONS: Variations in array profiles of sorted cell populations can be associated with specific histological features, suggesting a possible diagnostic application of ready made apoptosis macroarrays in haematopathology.
