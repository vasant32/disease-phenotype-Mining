 BACKGROUND: Salvage therapy for patients with refractory/relapsed B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is based on polychemotherapy, followed by high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation in eligible patients (HDT/ASCT). R-DHAP combines rituximab with cisplatin, cytarabine, and dexamethasone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We substituted cisplatin with oxaliplatin to avoid nephrotoxicity and retrospectively analyzed a large series of 91 patients with refractory/relapsed B-cell NHL to evaluate toxicities, response rates (RRs), and survival. Median age at R-DHAX (rituximab/dexamethasone/cytarabine/oxaliplatin) treatment was 60 years (range, 28-82 years). Renal insufficiency was present in 18 patients. The most frequent histologic subtypes were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 42) and follicular lymphoma (n = 30). Seventeen patients (19%) were naive to rituximab at time of R-DHAX. RESULTS: Grade III/IV toxicities were mainly hematologic, including anemia (n = 9), neutropenia (n = 44), and thrombocytopenia (n = 47). Grade I/II neurologic toxicities, sensitive or motor, were observed, and these were mainly transient except for 3 cases of motor neuropathy associated with previous exposure to vincristine. Neither renal toxicities nor degradation of previous renal insufficiency were observed. The overall RR was 75%, with a complete RR of 57%, with no statistical difference between patients previously treated with rituximab versus without rituximab. At a median follow-up of 23 months, 2-year probability rates of overall survival and progression-free survival were 75% and 43%, respectively, with a significant difference between patients treated with HDT/ASCT and patients not eligible for HDT/ASCT. CONCLUSION: R-DHAX is an efficient regimen in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell NHL even in elderly patients if hematologic toxicities are closely managed.
