The first case of extranodal signet ring cell lymphoma involving the thyroid gland is reported in a 53-year-old woman with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Since 1978, 24 cases of signet ring cell lymphoma, all involving primarily nodal tissue, have been documented in the literature. This rare neoplasm is believed to be a variant of non-Hodgkin's follicular lymphoma, which may be mistaken for metastatic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
