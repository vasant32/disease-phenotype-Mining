AIMS: Although diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is categorized as a distinct entity in the REAL classification of lymphomas, it represents a heterogeneous group of neoplasms. A subgroup is probably of follicle centre cell origin and may evolve from a pre-existing follicular lymphoma. The t(14;18) chromosomal translocation can be demonstrated in the majority of follicular lymphomas and the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of t(14;18) translocation in a series of de novo nodal diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. We correlated this with the immunohistochemical expression of CD10, bcl2 and bcl6, markers which are usually expressed by the neoplastic cells in follicular lymphomas. We also correlated these parameters with the presence or absence of p53 protein expression by the neoplastic cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Nodal diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (n=34) were stained immunohistochemically with monoclonal antibodies to CD10, bcl2, bcl6 and p53 (D07). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the t(14;18) translocation was also performed. Fourteen, 24 and 29 (41%, 71%, 85%) cases exhibited positivity for CD10, bcl2 and bcl6, respectively. In 12 cases there was positivity with D07 (35%). By PCR, the t(14;18) translocation was identified in five cases (15%), four of which were positive for CD10 and bcl2 and all of which were positive for bcl6. One of five cases positive for the chromosomal translocation exhibited positivity with D07. CONCLUSIONS: In this study the t(14;18) translocation was identified in 15% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, all but one of which exhibited positivity for CD10, bcl2 and bcl6. These may represent cases of follicle centre cell origin which may or may not have evolved from a pre-existing follicular lymphoma. It is possible that positivity for CD10 especially may identify cases which are of follicle centre cell origin and that the absence of t(14;18) translocation in some of these cases may reflect the fact that the translocation cannot normally be demonstrated in all follicular lymphomas. Whether the presence or absence of the translocation and the immunophenotype are prognostically important should be investigated further.
