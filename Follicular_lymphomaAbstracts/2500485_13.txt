Somatic hypermutation of rearranged Ig V region gene plays a major role in generating antibody diversity. Recently, V mutation has been established as a major mechanism of tumor escape from anti-Id immunotherapy. We cloned and sequenced the expressed Ig H and L chain V regions from a case of B acute lymphoblastic leukemia in order to evaluate B cell stages associated with V region mutation, and to determine which tumors would be better suited to Id directed immunotherapy. A consensus VH and V lambda sequence representing tumor at diagnosis was obtained by conventional cDNA cloning in lambda gt10 from a heterohybridoma. Primers which flanked both V regions were used in a modified polymerase chain reaction to generate multiple independent sequences from tumor cells harvested at relapse. In order to exclude mutations due to infidelity of the amplification procedure, single cDNA templates of known sequence were also amplified. The polymerase chain reaction proved to be an effective procedure to obtain multiple clones, but replication in M13 was associated with a low rate of base misincorporation. The results indicate that there is no evidence for biologically significant ongoing mutation in this t(8;14) B cell tumor when comparing sequences at diagnosis and relapse. Thus, V somatic mutation may be restricted to a discrete B cell stage whose malignant counterpart is follicular lymphoma.
