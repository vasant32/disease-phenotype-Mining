Primary pleural lymphoma is rare. It occurs in only 7% of lymphoma cases. We report herein two cases of primary pleural Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin follicular lymphomas diagnosed by thoracoscopy under local anesthesia. Both patients presented initially with dyspnea revealing pleural effusions. The pleural findings during thoracoscopy differed in the two cases and selective pleural biopsies under optical forceps led to the diagnosis of lymphoma. To date, primary pleural Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin follicular lymphomas have not been reported.
