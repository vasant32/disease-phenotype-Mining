The My4 antibody, one of a number of monoclonal antibodies that react with the CD14 antigen, was originally reported to weakly stain monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes. However, recent studies have shown that the My4 antibody also stains normal peripheral blood B lymphocytes and some subtypes of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Thus, the authors have studied a large series of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas stained with the My4 antibody. In frozen sections of reactive lymph node biopsy specimens, the My4 antibody strongly stained mantle zone B lymphocytes and weakly reacted with dendritic reticulum cells and histiocytes. In a series of 245 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, the My4 antibody stained 111 (45%) cases: 108 of 189 (57%) B-cell lymphomas, 3 of 50 (6%) T-cell lymphomas, and 0 of 6 null cell lymphomas. My4-positive B-cell lymphomas occurred in all histologic subtypes with the exception of small noncleaved cell lymphomas. Follicular lymphomas were most often My4 positive (82%). My4 antibody staining showed no correlation with Working Formulation grade. All three My4-positive T-cell lymphomas had a mature T-cell phenotype. Seventy-six of the 111 (68%) My4-positive lymphomas were also analyzed with at least one other anti-CD14 antibody, either Mo2 and/or Leu-M3. In all cases the antigens that react with Mo2 and Leu-M3 were not expressed. Thus, the staining of reactive and neoplastic B cells by My4 appears to be unique to this antibody and is not a feature of all anti-CD14 antibodies.
