Involvement of the temporal arteries, considered to be the hallmark of giant cell arteritis, is rather rare in other pathologic processes. We describe a patient with lymphoma involving temporal artery. A 68-year-old man has been followed closely without therapy since 1989 for a low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He presented in 1995 with asymptomatic nodules on the temporal artery with preservation of the pulse. Temporal artery biopsy showed periarterial infiltration of mononuclear cells in keeping with follicular mixed cell lymphoma. The differential diagnosis of temporal arteritis must therefore, include other vasculitides, light chain amyloidosis but also lymphoma and emphasize the need for a temporal artery biopsy.
