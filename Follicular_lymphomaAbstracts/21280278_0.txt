A series of eight small intestine lymphomas comprised two cases of follicular lymphoma (FL), one anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) ALK negative, and five cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The lymphomas were diagnosed by routine hematoxylin-eosin staining, immunohistochemistry and the FISH method for translocation t(14;18). Immunohistochemistry revealed that the diffuse large B-cell lymphomas were of the non-germinal center type (non GC-DLBCL). In most cases, the tumors formed solid well-circumscribed nodules or resulted in diffuse infiltration of the intestinal wall. In one case of follicular lymphoma, microscopic foci of tumor were found in the intestinal mucosa which spread far from the primary nodule and probably beyond the resection border. It is difficult to ascertain whether this phenomenon represents colonization of pre-existing non-neoplastic follicles by lymphoma or spreading of the tumor within the same tissue. In this case, surgical removal of the lymphoma is problematic.
