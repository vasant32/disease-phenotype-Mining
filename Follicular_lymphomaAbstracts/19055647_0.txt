This study investigated the prevalence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and its association with P53 expression in a panel of 87 previously untreated nodal non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) from India. Polymerase chain reaction specific for Epstein Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and EBNA-3C was performed on the lymphnode tissue DNA, while P53 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. EBV, predominantly type A strain, was detected in 27/87 (31%) nodal lymphoid malignancies, 11/46 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, 6/17 follicular lymphoma, 4/6 anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL), 5/11 peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) and 1/7 lymphoblastic lymphomas. EBV infection was more frequently observed in a specific subset of nodal NHL, suggesting a causative role of EBV infection in the pathogenesis of ALCL and PTCL. There was no significant association between EBV and P53 expression in our series of NHL patients.
