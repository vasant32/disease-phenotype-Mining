We report here a patient with relapsed follicular lymphoma who developed secondary acute myeloid leukaemia 15 months after radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan, the fifth described case to date. We review the literature for the potential causal relationship between RIT and secondary myelodysplastic syndromes/acute myeloid leukaemia.
