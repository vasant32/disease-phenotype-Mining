We conducted a phase 1/2 trial of high-dose 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan in combination with high-dose etoposide (VP-16) 40 to 60 mg/kg (day -4) and cyclophosphamide 100 mg/kg (day -2) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in 31 patients with CD20+ non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Patients underwent dosimetry (day -21) with 5 mCi (185 MBq) 111In-ibritumomab tiuxetan following 250 mg/m2 rituximab, followed a week later by 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan to deliver a target dose of 1000 cGy to highest normal organ. Bone marrow biopsy was done on day -7 to estimate radiation dose and stem cells were reinfused when the radiation dose was estimated to be less than 5 cGy. The median 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan dose was 71.6 mCi (2649.2 MBq; range, 36.6-105 mCi; range, 1354.2-3885 MBq). Histology included follicular lymphoma (n = 12), diffuse large B-cell (n = 14), and mantle cell (n = 5). The median number of prior chemo-therapy treatments was 2. The treatment was well tolerated. The median times to reach an absolute neutrophil count greater than 500/microL and platelet count more than 20,000/microL were 10 days and 12 days, respectively. There were 2 deaths and 5 relapses. At a median follow-up of 22 months, the 2-year estimated overall survival and relapse-free survival rates are 92% and 78%, respectively. We conclude that high-dose 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan can be combined safely with high-dose etoposide and cyclophosphamide without an increase in transplant-related toxicity or delayed engraftment.
