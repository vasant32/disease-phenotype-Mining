The clinical significance and prognostic value of CD10 in de novo diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is largely unknown. We retrospectively studied 19 men and 9 women based on the following criteria: (1) DLBCL with no evidence of concomitant or antecedent follicular lymphoma; (2) available flow cytometric immunophenotyping data, including CD10 status; (3) older than 15 years; (4) specific exclusion of high-grade, Burkitt-like lymphoma; and (5) exclusion of primary cutaneous DLBCL. When available, clinical data at diagnosis, including components of the international prognostic index, were reviewed. Eleven cases were CD10+, and 17 were CD10-. There was no significant difference between the CD10+ and CD10- groups in age, sex, stage, performance status, extranodal involvement, or serum lactate dehydrogenase levels at diagnosis. However, in the 26 cases for which follow-up data were available, the CD10+ group displayed a shorter overall survival than the CD10- group (8 vs 30 months). Although the clinical findings at diagnosis are similar in CD10+ and CD10- DLBCL, CD10 expression is associated with shortened overall survival. Therefore, our data suggest CD10 expression may have prognostic importance in adults with de novo DLBCL.
