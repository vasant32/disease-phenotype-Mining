 PURPOSE: We report on a multicenter phase II trial of (90)yttrium-ibritumomab-tiuxetan ((90)YIT) as first-line stand-alone therapy for patients with follicular lymphoma (FL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-nine patients with CD20(+) FL grade 1 to 3a in stages II, III, or IV, age 50 years old or older requiring therapy were enrolled. They received (90)YIT according to standard procedure. If complete response (CR) or unconfirmed complete response (CRu) without evidence for minimal residual disease (MRD) 6 months after application of (90)YIT was achieved, patients were observed without further intervention. The same applied to patients with partial response (PR) or with stable disease (SD). Patients with CR but with persisting MRD were to receive a consolidation treatment with rituximab. Primary end point was the clinical and molecular response rate. Secondary end points were time to progression, safety, and tolerability. RESULTS: Six months after treatment with (90)YIT, 56% of the patients showed a CR or CRu and 31% achieved a PR. After a median follow-up of 30.6 months, the progression-free survival (PFS) was 26 months. There was a trend for shorter PFS in patients with increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Of the 26 patients who had CR 12 months after (90)YIT, only three had relapsed. Median time to next treatment has not been reached. The most common toxicities were transient thrombocytopenia and leukocytopenia. Nonhematologic toxicities never exceeded grade 2 according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v2.0). CONCLUSION: (90)YIT is well tolerated and achieves high response rates. Patients with increased LDH tend to relapse earlier, and individuals in remission 1 year after (90)YIT appear to have long- lasting responses.
