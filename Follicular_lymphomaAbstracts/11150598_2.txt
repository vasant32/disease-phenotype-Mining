The most frequent nonrandom chromosome rearrangements in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the t(14;18)(q32;q21) found in follicular lymphomas. The t(14;18) in Hodgkin disease (HD) was rarely observed using cytogenetic techniques. Although Southern blot analysis failed to demonstrate the t(14;18), there have been conflicting reports concerning the occurrence of the translocation using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods in HD. In some HD tissues, the translocation might be derived from background lymphocytes rather than Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells, because B-cells with t(14;18) are regularly generated in normal individuals. However, the cells bearing the translocation have remained unidentified. We describe a patient with HD who showed t(14;18) in hyperdiploid cells using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and HRS cells which were strongly positive for BCL2 by immunohistochemistry. These findings suggest that HRS cells may have a t(14;18).
