BCL-6 mutations are accumulated during B-cell transit through the germinal center (GC) and provide a histogenetic marker for B-cell tumors. On the basis of a comprehensive analysis of 308 B-cell neoplasms, we (1) expand the spectrum of tumors associated with BCL-6 mutations; (2) corroborate the notion that mutations cluster with GC and post-GC B-cell neoplasms; and (3) identify heterogeneous mutation frequency among B-lineage diffuse large cell lymphoma (B-DLCL) subsets. Mutations are virtually absent in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (P <.001) and mantle cell lymphoma (P <.05), whereas they occur frequently in GC or post-GC neoplasms, including lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, MALT lymphomas, B-DLCL and Burkitt lymphoma. Among B-DLCL, mutations occur frequently in systemic nodal B-DLCL, primary extranodal B-DLCL, CD5(+) B-DLCL, CD30(+) B-DLCL, and primary splenic B-DLCL, suggesting a similar histogenesis of these B-DLCL subsets. Conversely, mutations are rare in primary mediastinal B-DLCL with sclerosis (10.0%; P <.01), supporting a distinct histogenesis for this lymphoma. Longitudinal follow-up of B-DLCL transformed from follicular lymphoma shows that they BCL-6 mutations may accumulate during histologic progression. Mutations also occur in some B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias, small lymphocytic lymphomas, and hairy cell leukemias, consistent with the hypothesis that a fraction of these lymphoproliferations are related to GC-like cells. Finally, the molecular pattern of 193 mutational events reinforces the hypothesis that mutations of BCL-6 and immunoglobulin genes are caused by similar mechanisms. (Blood. 2000;95:651-659)
