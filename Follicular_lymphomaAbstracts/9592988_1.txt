The appearance of a chronic B lymphocytosis is usually associated with the existence of an underlying monoclonal malignant condition. However, a few cases of persistent polyclonal B cell lymphocytosis (PPBL), presented in young asymptomatic women with an uneventful course, have been reported in recent years. In these PPBL cases, since the lymphocytes usually display an anomalous morphology, a false diagnosis of a neoplastic chronic lymphoproliferative syndrome can be easily made. We report a typical case of PPBL that presents multiple bcl-2 rearrangements, the typical finding of follicular lymphomas. A review of different causes of benign non neoplastic lymphocytosis with special steadiness in changes in the lymphoid subsets will be made.
