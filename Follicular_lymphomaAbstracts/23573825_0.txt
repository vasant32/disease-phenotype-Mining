Abstract Relapse is the main cause of therapeutic failure in Follicular Lymphoma (FL). We set out to evaluate the role of consolidation with yttrium-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan in intermediate and high-risk FL patients after four cycles of CHOP-R and two CHOP cycles. 30 patients were included. The overall response rate after consolidation therapy was 93%. Of the 18 patients who presented partial remission after the induction treatment, 11 had complete remission after the consolidation treatment. The complete clinical response rate was 76.6%. The most important G 3 / 4 toxicity was hematological, with 46% thrombopenia and 56% neutropenia. With median follow-up of 26 months the means for progression-free survival or overall survival were not reached. Our data support consolidation treatment with yttrium-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan as an effective treatment, and it provides a long progression-free survival and overall survival in first line after response to induction treatment in intermediate and high-risk FL patients.
