Our hospital admitted 231 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas between June 1976 and November 1984. Review of these cases revealed the following profile: ages ranged from 1 to 70 years (median: 30 years), 156 males, predominantly children and adolescents, and 75 females. Diffuse histiocytic lymphoma accounted for 40.6 per cent of all cases. Seventeen patients (7 per cent) had nodular lymphomas. Fifteen patients, predominantly male children and adolescents, had lymphoblastic lymphomas and showed high association with mediastinal mass (47 per cent). Extranodal lymphomas mostly of the diffuse histiocytic subtype were diagnosed in 100 cases (43.3 per cent) and most frequently situated in the small intestine (59 cases). Burkitt's lymphoma--32 patients (14 per cent)--presented most often in male patients during the first decade of life and as an abdominal intestinal disease (19 cases). There were four cases of Mediterranean abdominal lymphoma (IPSID). Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in Jordanians are mostly of the diffuse histiocytic type, are rarely nodular, have a high frequency of extranodal involvement and tend to occur in younger age groups. Mediterranean abdominal lymphoma is less frequent than previously thought. The use of both of the Rappaport and Lukes-Collins classifications demonstrated a high degree of reproducibility.
