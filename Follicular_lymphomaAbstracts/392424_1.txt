Immunological surface marker techniques were applied in a study of 29 cases of chronic lymphocytic leumaemia and 22 of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Surface marker characteristics distinguished 2 subtypes of B lymphocytes. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia was a monoclonal proliferation of B lymphocytes which produced spontaneous rosettes with mouse erythrocytes and had faintly immunofluorescent surface immunoglobulin. The majority of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas also had their origin from B lymphocytes but in contrast, this subtype did not show receptors for mouse erythrocytes and their surface immunoglobulin was brightly staining and demonstrated "capping". The clonal origin of nodular lymphomas could also be demonstrated on frozen sections stained for surface immunoglobulin. Two cases of true histiocytic lymphoma were identified. The current information available on surface marker characteristics of the leukaemias and lymphomas is reviewed.
