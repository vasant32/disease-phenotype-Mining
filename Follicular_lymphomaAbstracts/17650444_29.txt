We analyzed FcgammaRIIIA-158V/F and FcgammaRIIA-131H/R polymorphisms in a cohort of 94 newly diagnosed follicular lymphoma (FL) patients sequentially treated with CHOP and Rituximab. With a median follow-up of 5.8 years, the overall survival at 8 years is 83%. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed no correlation between FcgammaRIIIA-158VV/VF and FcgammaRIIA-131HH/HR polymorphisms and the overall response rate, the molecular response and the event-free survival obtained after CHOP and Rituximab. By contrast, the achievement of a durable molecular clearance of BCL2/IgH+ cells detectable in the bone marrow is confirmed to be a reliable predictive factor of a better long-term clinical outcome.
