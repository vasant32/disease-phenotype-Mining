A polymerase chain reaction analysis of biopsy specimens from a total of 52 patients with Hodgkin's disease has revealed the presence of the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation in 14 cases (28%). Twelve involved the major breakpoint region and two included the minor cluster region of the bcl-2 gene. Direct sequencing of the amplified 14q+ junctions from the initial four positive cases (from 21 biopsies) has been previously published and demonstrated the similarity in nature of the break-points to those described in follicular lymphoma and lymphoid hyperplasia. The 52 biopsies have also been studied with a monoclonal antibody to immunolocalize the Bcl-2 protein. In all cases Bcl-2 positivity was observed in the majority of surrounding lymphocytes. However, in 11 cases, positive immunostaining in the Sternberg-Reed cells was also observed. Three of these cases contained the t(14;18) translocation, but 11 cases which were positive for the t(14;18) by PCR did not show Bcl-2 protein staining in the Sternberg-Reed cells. This data confirms the presence of t(14;18) in 28% of biopsies from Hodgkin's disease and demonstrates Bcl-2 protein staining in a variable proportion of Sternberg-Reed cells of some cases.
