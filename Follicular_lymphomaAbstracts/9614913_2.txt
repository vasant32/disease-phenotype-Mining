Three cases of (3;13)(q27;q14) translocation observed in different histological types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) are reported here. This new recurring translocation in NHL was secondary in at least two of the patients because it was associated with another specific change [i.e., t(8;14) (q24;q32) in Burkitt lymphoma and t(14;18)(q32;q21) in typical follicular lymphoma]. In two of the cases for which molecular analysis was performed, a rearrangement of the LAZ-3/BCK-6 gene was found.
