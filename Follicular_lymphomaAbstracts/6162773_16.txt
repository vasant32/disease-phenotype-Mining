The occurrence and pattern of cytoplasmic muramidase containing histiocytes were studied by the unlabeled antibody peroxidase-antiperoxidase method in biopsy material from patients with Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and reactive hyperplasia. The majority of lymph nodes from patients with Hodgkin's disease, nodular lymphoma, and reactive hyperplasia gave positive staining reactions when tested in this manner. Differences in the staining pattern were observed for the different conditions studied. In general, stain positive cells occurred in one of the following four patterns: nodular, dispersed, aggregating without background stain, or aggregating with background stain (mottling pattern). The nodular and aggregating without background stain patterns were not specific and were seen in various conditions. The dispersed pattern, however, was observed only in some cases of non-Hodgkin's diffuse lymphomas, suggesting a subgroup of tumors characterized by active participation of reactive histiocytes. The mottling pattern was virtually limited to Hodgkin's disease. Since the mottling pattern appeared to be produced by virtue of a large amount of extracellular muramidase, the elevation of the serum muramidase level in Hodgkin's disease may be related to enzymatically active secretory histiocytes. Moreover, the mottling staining pattern was observed frequently in the lymphocytic predominance and nodular sclerosis type of Hodgkin's disease, but relatively infrequently in the mixed cellularity or lymphocytic depletion types, suggesting that the variation in histiocytic activity may be related to the course of the disease. The decreased staining reaction observed in the latter two categories could not be accounted for by a decrease in the numbers of histiocytic cells in hematoxylin and eosin stained sections, suggesting that release or synthesis may be defective in those unfavorable types of Hodgkin's disease.
