To our knowledge, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) has never been reported in the hard palate, but it is commonly observed in the nasopharynx and Waldeyer's tonsillar ring. MCL is characterized by a diffuse infiltrate of small lymphocytes with the expression of CD5, CD20, and cyclin D1 (Bcl-1), but not CD10. MCL presenting in the hard palate must be accurately distinguished from other forms of so-called small B-cell lymphomas-such as small lymphocytic lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue-because MCL possesses a worse prognosis. Awareness of MCL of the hard palate will prompt pathologists to perform adequate immunohistochemical analysis to aid in confirming the diagnosis.
