BACKGROUND: The influence of age on the outcome of follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (FL) was studied in a population-based non-Hodgkin's lymphoma registry. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study comprised 214 follicular lymphoma patients. Grade I/II was considered separately from grade III FL. The data were analyzed with respect to three age groups: <60, 60-69 and >or=70 years. RESULTS: The overall survival rate decreased in the older age groups. Grade III patients showed a statistically significant decrease in overall survival in comparison with grade I/II patients (P = 0.03). Cause-specific survival analysis showed that in the older age groups, there was an increasing influence of concomitant disease on the death rate, especially among grade III FL patients >70 years of age. The survival curve in grade III FL patients was shown to reach a plateau. The prognostic scoring system, according to the Italian Lymphoma Intergroup, fitted better to grade I/II patients, while the International Prognostic Index showed better discrimination amongst grade III patients. CONCLUSIONS: Separate grading for follicular lymphoma is useful. An age >70 years has a negative impact on outcome, but the contribution of concomitant disease herein is important. Different prognostic scoring systems should be applied to the different grades of FL.
