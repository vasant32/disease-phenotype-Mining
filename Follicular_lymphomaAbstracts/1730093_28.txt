The bcl-2 gene, encoding a mitochondrial membrane protein suggested to play an important role in cell survival, is translocated into the Ig loci in about 80% of human follicular lymphomas, which results in a high level of expression. This report shows that bcl-2 was expressed in eight of eight human multiple myeloma cell lines and in normal lymph node and bone marrow plasma cells. In the majority of the myeloma lines, the level of expression was comparable with that observed in Karpas 422, a follicular lymphoma cell line carrying a 14;18 translocation of the bcl-2 gene. DNA rearrangements of the bcl-2 locus were evident in only one of the myeloma cell lines, U-266-1970. In this cell line, which exhibited the highest bcl-2 expression, a fourfold increased copy number of the bcl-2 gene was estimated by Southern analysis. This amplification was lost in cells of later passages (U-266-1984), suggesting that bcl-2 might possibly have played a role in the tumor development in vivo. Our results are in contrast to previous observations in murine plasmacytoma, in which bcl-2 was shown to be silent. The results also contradict the published observation that bcl-2 is not expressed at terminal stages of B-cell differentiation. It is at present unclear whether the high expression of bcl-2 in human myeloma is the result of a deregulated expression associated with the malignant phenotype or a mere reflection of the bcl-2 expression typical of normal plasma cells.
