OBJECTIVE: To determine the usefulness of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), p53 protein expression and transformed lymphocyte count (TLC) as adjunctive tests to differentiate indolent small B-cell lymphoma from large cell lymphoma in fine needle aspiration biopsies. STUDY DESIGN: Aspirates of lymphoproliferative disorders from April 1993 to January 1997 were reviewed. The percentage of TLCs was determined on the Papanicolaou smear. The percentage and intensity of p53 and PCNA immunocytochemical staining was evaluated on cell block sections. These results were compared and correlated with the final diagnoses based on available morphology, flow cytometry and clinical history. RESULTS: There were 40 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 12 reactive lymph nodes. Adequate cell blocks were available on 16 large cell lymphomas, 7 grade 1-2 follicular center cell lymphomas, 6 mucosal associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas, 2 small lymphocytic lymphomas and 2 mantle cell lymphomas. Average TLC and p53 nuclear staining was highest in large cell lymphomas (57% TLC and 24% p53), followed by grades 1 and 2 follicular lymphomas (14% TLC and 15% p53) and lowest in other indolent lymphomas (< 10% TLC and < 1% p53). Average PCNA staining was highest in large cell lymphomas (46%) and lowest in small lymphocytic lymphomas (7%); however, TLC was the best parameter for differentiating large cell lymphoma from indolent small B-cell lymphoma. CONCLUSION: TLC differentiated large cell lymphoma from indolent small B-cell lymphoma better than either p53 or PCNA alone or in combination. Significant overlap between categories limits usefulness of these immunocytochemical stains for differentiating these entities.
