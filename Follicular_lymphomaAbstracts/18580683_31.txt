IgG4-related sclerosing disease is a recently recognized inflammatory lesion frequently involving pancreas, submandibular gland, lacrimal gland, and lymph node. We report 3 cases of ocular adnexal lymphoma arising in IgG4-related chronic sclerosing dacryoadenitis, a phenomenon that has not been previously reported. The patients presented with bilateral or unilateral ocular adnexal mass usually present for many years. One patient also had asymptomatic diffuse lymphadenopathy. Two patients had biopsy-proven IgG4-related chronic sclerosing dacryoadenitis before the current presentation, and 1 had systemic involvement by IgG4-related sclerosing disease as evidenced by increased IgG4+ cells in a prior nasopharyngeal biopsy. Two cases showed features of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid-tissue type (1 with large cell transformation) and 1 follicular lymphoma. Thus, the lymphoid hyperplasia of IgG4-related sclerosing disease can provide a substrate for the emergence of lymphoma. In addition, we report 3 cases of ocular adnexal extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma that show sclerosing inflammation in the background and numerous IgG4+ monotypic plasma cells. In the absence of prior biopsies or information on serum IgG4 titer, it is unclear whether these cases represent lymphoma complicating IgG4-related sclerosing disease or de novo lymphoma. Nonetheless, these cases are distinctive in that the neoplastic cells express IgG4 (light chain restricted), whereas unselected cases of ocular adnexal lymphomas do not show IgG4 expression.
