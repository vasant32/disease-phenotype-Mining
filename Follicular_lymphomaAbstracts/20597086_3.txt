Recent studies have identified receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) on the surface of chronic lymphoid leukaemia (CLL) cells. In order to determine whether ROR1 expression is a suitable surrogate marker for the diagnosis of CLL we analysed the mRNA level of ROR1 in different types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), and detected elevated levels of ROR1 compared to control peripheral mononuclear cells in several entities (CLL ≥ mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) > marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) >> diffuse large B-cell lymphoma > follicular lymphoma). ROR1 protein was expressed intensely on the cell surface of lymphoma cells with leukaemic blood count detected by three colour immunofluorescence. Our results indicate that ROR1 expression is not limited to CLL cases, but it is more prevalent in NHLs, mainly in MCL where it is expressed intensely and MZL where it is expressed moderately, suggesting a general role of ROR1 in lymphoma genesis and/or maintenance.
