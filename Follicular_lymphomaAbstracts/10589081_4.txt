The most cases of splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) seem to respond favorably to splenectomy. The diagnosis of this lymphoma is mainly based on the recognition of a micronodular pattern of splenic involvement with marginal zone differentiation. However, it is possible to find so-called "marginal zone differentiation" in splenic involvement by other small B-cell lymphomas, particularly mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and follicular lymphoma. We report a case of blastic MCL, large cell/anaplastic variant with a high level of clinical aggressiveness, showing biphasic cytology and a micronodular pattern which resembles SMZL. A single biopsy corresponding to this case shows two phases of tumoral progression in a MCL, a rare finding in MCL. In conclusion, the differential diagnosis of SMZL must take the possibility of a blastic MCL with biphasic cytology into account, as the case here.
