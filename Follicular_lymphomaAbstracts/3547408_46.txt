In most human follicular lymphomas, the chromosome translocation t(14;18) occurs within two breakpoint clustering regions on chromosome 18, the major one at the 3' untranslated region of the bcl-2 gene and the minor one at 3' of the gene. Analysis of a panel of follicular lymphoma DNAs using probes for the first exon of the bcl-2 gene indicates that DNA rearrangements may also occur 5' to the involved bcl-2 gene. In this case the IgH locus and the bcl-2 gene are found in the order 3' C gamma S gamma/mu JH 5'::5' bcl-2 3' (where C = constant, S = switch, and JH = joining segment of the heavy chain locus), suggesting that an inversion also occurred during the translocation process. The coding regions of the bcl-2 gene, however, are left intact in all cases of follicular lymphoma studied to date.
