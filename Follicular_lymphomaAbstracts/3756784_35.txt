Clinical features and treatment results are analyzed for 76 patients with Stage I-II follicular lymphoma seen between 1974 and 1981. During this period, 66% of the patients received involved-field radiotherapy (XRT) alone, and 34% received chemotherapy with or without XRT. At 5 years, the overall survival was 67%, the cause-specific survival was 73%, and the relapse-free survival (RFS) was 48%, with no relapses to date among nine patients followed beyond 60 months. Adverse prognostic features for survival included extranodal disease and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase. For RFS, adverse features included extranodal disease and bulky abdominal disease. The RFS was significantly better for patients receiving chemotherapy with or without XRT than for XRT alone (64% versus 37% at 5 years, P = 0.02), despite a higher frequency of adverse prognostic features in the chemotherapy-treated group. About 50% of Stage I-II follicular lymphoma patients may be curable, and the inclusion of chemotherapy in the initial treatment may increase the potentially curable fraction.
