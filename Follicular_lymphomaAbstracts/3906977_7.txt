Among 20 patients with malignant lymphoma of the thyroid gland, the mean age at diagnosis was 63 years and the male to female ratio was 1:6. All patients had a firm, rapidly enlarging neck mass. In 90% of the patients the mass had been present for less than 1 year; in 40%, for less than 1 month. Approximately half of the patients tested had hypothyroidism; three fourths had elevated antithyroid antibodies. There was one nodular lymphoma. The remaining 17 cases available for review were diffuse. Thyroid lobectomy was performed in seven patients, limited excision in eight, and needle biopsy alone in five. External irradiation was administered in 11 cases (55%). Chemotherapy was used alone in one patient (5%) and in combination with radiotherapy in eight (40%). Six patients (30%) were alive without evidence of recurrent disease at follow-up ranging from 1 to 12 years. Eleven patients had died of lymphoma, all but one dying within 1 year. One patient died of other causes and two were lost to follow-up study. There was no appreciable effect of patient age or sex, lymphoma histology, or extent of surgical resection on survival. Treatment of choice for primary lymphoma of the thyroid gland appears to be external irradiation or chemotherapy, alone or in combination. The role of surgery is limited to making a tissue diagnosis of lymphoma, unless the tumor is completely intrathyroidal.
