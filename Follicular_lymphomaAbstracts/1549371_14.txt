The majority of follicular lymphoma cells carry the typical chromosome translocation 14;18, which juxtaposes the bcl-2 gene to the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) gene. Variant translocations of the bcl-2 gene to the Ig lambda or Ig kappa gene have been found by molecular biological techniques in a significant fraction (approximately 10%) of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, there have been no reports describing the presence of cytogenetic 18;22 and 2;18 translocations in CLL, in spite of extensive karyotypic studies. We present here two cases of CLL, one with cytogenetically detected t(2;18)(p11;q21) and the other with the t(18;22)(q21;q11). The molecular analysis revealed that these translocations juxtaposed the bcl-2 and immunoglobulin light-chain (IgL) genes. The t(18;22) broke the 5' flanking region of the bcl-2 gene and juxtaposed to the immunoglobulin lambda light-chain (Ig lambda) gene in a head-to-head configuration, as in the cases previously described. In the case of the t(2;18), the bcl-2 gene and immunoglobulin kappa light-chain (Ig kappa) gene were juxtaposed in a head-to-tail configuration, which is opposite to that expected from the orientation of the genes on chromosomes. The breakpoint was located within the 5' untranslated region of the bcl-2 gene. The results presented here indicate that the bcl-2/immunoglobulin light-chain (IgL) gene juxtaposition seen in a fraction of CLL is the result of cytogenetically detectable reciprocal chromosome translocations 2;18 and 18;22.
