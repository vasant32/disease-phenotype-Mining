 BACKGROUND: Long-term clinical and molecular remissions in patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) following high-dose therapy (HDT) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) have been evaluated in only a few studies. Results are especially limited for second-line HDT with BEAM (BCNU, etoposide, cytarabine and melphalan). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty patients with FL received ASCT in our institution (18 first-line with total body irradiation and cyclophosphamide, 34 second-line with BEAM and 8 â‰¥third-line with BEAM). In the case of long-term remission (>6 years; N = 17), peripheral blood was tested for minimal residual disease by t(14;18)- and IGH-PCR. RESULTS: Ten-year overall survival, progression-free survival and freedom from progression (FFP) after first-line ASCT were 79%, 57% and 64% after second-line ASCT 41%, 35% and 42%, respectively. Prognostic factors for FFP were treatment line and FLIPI (Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index). Ten-year FFP for second-line ASCT and low-risk FLIPI was 57%, intermediate risk 37% and high risk 33%. No relapses occurred after 6 years following ASCT. Sixteen patients developed sustained long-term clinical and molecular remissions of up to 17.5 years. CONCLUSION: Sustained long-term clinical and molecular remissions can be achieved following ASCT, including HDT with BEAM in second line.
