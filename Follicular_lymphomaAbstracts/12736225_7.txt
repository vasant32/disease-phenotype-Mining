We have treated 38 transplant-eligible patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease using an outpatient-based regimen of ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide (ICE) for both salvage and peripheral blood stem cell mobilisation. Patients included relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 17), follicular lymphoma (n = II), T-cell lymphoma (n = 2), mantle cell lymphoma (n = 2) and Hodgkin's disease (n = 6). Seven patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and three patients with follicular lymphoma (26%) were considered chemorefractory. Cycles of ICE therapy were administered every 21 days as an outpatient and consisted of ifosfamide 5000 mg/m2 intravenously (i.v.) fractionated into three equally divided doses over 3 days, carboplatin [mg dose = 5 x area under the curve (AUC)] i.v. on day 1 and etoposide 100 mg/m2- i.v. daily for 3 days. Subsequently. granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)5 microg/kg subcutaneously (s.c.) was administered daily from day +5. Of the I I follicular lymphoma patients, 10 also received rituximab with ICE therapy. Median age of patients was 52 years (range 30-65). Patients received a mean of 2.6 cycles (range 1-4) of ICE. There were no toxic deaths and no significant non-haematological toxicities secondary to ICE therapy. Grade IV thrombocytopenia and grade IV neutropenia with at least one cycle of ICE were seen in 47% and 53% of patients, respectively. Median time to peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvest was 14 days (range 10-20). while the median CD34+ cell yield was 5.2 x 10(6) cells/kg(range 2.3 x 10(6)-27.2 x 10(6)). Only one of the ICE-responders failed to mobilise PBSCs. The overall response rate to ICE was 87%. comprising 14 patients (37%) who achieved a complete response (CR) and 19 (50%) who achieved a partial response (PR). A total of 30 patients have undergone autologous stem cell transplantation(SCT) while two follicular lymphoma patients have received a non-myeloablative allogeneic SCT. Follow-up is short: however, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the proportion of patients alive and event-free at a median follow-up of 11 months is 80% and 59%, respectively. Event-free survival for patients who achieved a CR after ICE and transplantation is 88% versus 45% for those who achieved a PR. These data confirm the efficacy and tolerability of fractionated ICE chemotherapy as both a salvage and mobilisation regimen that can be readily delivered in an outpatient setting.
