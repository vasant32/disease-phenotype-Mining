A truly follicular pattern is thought to be restricted to B-cell lymphomas. We observed a prominent follicular growth pattern in three cases of nodal peripheral T-cell lymphomas, of which two were initially diagnosed as follicular lymphomas. All three patients were male, ranged in age from 50 to 70 years, and had generalized lymphadenopathy at the time of diagnosis. The follicles were sharply demarcated in two cases and large and vague in one case; in all cases, they contained abundant follicular dendritic cells. Neoplastic cells were small to medium, with irregular cleaved or round nuclei and clear cytoplasm, which was abundant in one case. Lymphoma cells in all cases were CD4+ CD8- CD57- bcl-6, with CD10 coexpression in 2 cases. Clonal rearrangement of the gamma chain of the T-cell receptor gene was demonstrated in each case. These cases expand the differential diagnosis of lymphomas with a follicular growth pattern and suggest that neoplastic T cells may have the capacity to induce or home to follicular structures.
