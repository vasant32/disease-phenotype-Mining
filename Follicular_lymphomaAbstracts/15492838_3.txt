The clinical presentation, treatment and outcome were retrospectively evaluated in a series of 66 patients with primary B-cell lymphoma of the skin, referred to the Sheffield lymphoma group (SLG) between 1984 and 2003. This is the largest series reported from the UK. The lymphoma database was searched and clinical records were reviewed. Absence of any detectable extracutaneous lesion and the expression of B-cell restricted antigens by neoplastic cells were the essential criteria for selection of cases. The cohort included 37 (56%) males and 29 (44%) females with a mean age of 59 years. The most commonly involved site was the trunk and the disorder typically showed non-aggressive clinical behaviour; the majority of the patients presented with stage I (82%) disease with a tendency to remain localised to a limited area of the skin. Follicular lymphoma was the most common histologic subtype (35%), the next most frequent was the diffuse large cell lymphoma (32%) whereas marginal zone lymphoma constituted 15%. The majority (47%) of patients were treated with radiotherapy for localised disease whereas chemotherapy was given in 20% of patients, with single agent chlorambucil being most frequently used. Surgical excision as the sole modality of treatment was adequate in 33%. Disease-free survival (DFS) was 91% at 1 year, 82% at 2 years and 60% at 5 years. DFS was significantly lower with older age (>45 years), leg lesions, generalised and multiple lesions, and for those treated with chemotherapy. The survival at 5 and 10 years was 80%. The histologic grade, leg involvement and the number of lesions were the most significant variables affecting overall survival. Only 7 patients died of lymphoma. In conclusion, primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma represents a specific entity concerning clinical behaviour, response to treatment, and overall prognosis.
