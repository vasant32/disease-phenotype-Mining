Although Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in mammals are well-known to play important roles in innate immunity, newer roles for the TLRs have suggested that cells with aberrant TLR expression may have a survival advantage over normal cells. Lymphocytes are one of a small number of cell types that express many of the TLRs, suggesting that abnormal TLR levels/signaling may potentially influence the progression of malignant lymphomas. Thus, frozen samples of 51 lymph nodes from patients with follicular lymphoma (FL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) were analyzed for the expression of TLR1 to 9 using quantitative real-time PCR, and compared to those in reactive lymphadenopathy (RL) samples. TLR2 was over-expressed in both DLBCL and PTCL but not in FL when compared to RL. TLR1 and TLR4 expression was up-regulated in PTCL, while TLR8 was highly expressed in DLBCL. Although TLR5 showed lower expression in FL, expression of TLR3, TLR6, TLR7 and TLR9 did not vary significantly between different lymphoma subtypes. Double immunostaining revealed an increase in the number of TLR2 and/or TLR8 expressing lymphoma cells in DLBCL. In PTCL, TLR2 and TLR4 expression was localized to neoplastic T cells. TLR expression is highly variable among lymphoma subtypes. However, despite this some significant differences exist that may prove useful in the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
