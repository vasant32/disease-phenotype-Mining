Seventeen cases of splenic centroblastic-centrocytic or centroblastic lymphoma are reported. A large splenomegaly is discovered in all these cases as the prominent symptom. For this reason, all these cases can be considered as primary lymphoma of the spleen. Splenectomy is done in 7 cases for diagnosis a period of 2 to 8 months after the discovery of the splenomegaly. In these patients, no bone marrow biopsy was performed before splenectomy. In 8 other cases, the diagnosis of follicular lymphoma is proposed on a bone marrow biopsy performed with the aim to disclose an etiology for the splenomegaly. In 3 of these cases, a lymph node (2 cases) or a tonsil biopsy (1 case) discover a tumoral localization before the splenectomy. In the 2 last cases, the diagnosis is recognized on a lymph node biopsy. The most important clinical and biological data are compared for these 17 patients. The anatomopathological data are described. In 15 cases, a multimicronodular pattern is recognized on the spleen section. The 2 other cases express a multimacronodular pattern. The weight of the spleen is comprised between 450 and 3,350 g, with only 6 spleens weighing less than 1,000 g. The spleens with multimicronodular pattern correspond to a follicular centroblastic centrocytic lymphoma of low grade of malignancy in the Kiel-Lennert classification. The 2 multimacronodular spleens exhibit the histological aspect of a polymorphous centroblastic lymphoma of a high grade of malignancy. The equivalent of these histological types are given in the Working Formulation. The diagnosis with others diseases of the spleen is discussed. For fourteen patients, the follow-up is available. Six patients are alive, with an evolution of many years. Because of the few number of cases, it is not possible to correlate the histological subtypes according to Kiel or to the WF, and the clinical stage with the evolution. To perform such correlation, a multicentric study should be organized.
