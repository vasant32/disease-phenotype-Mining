The differentiation of reactive follicular hyperplasia (RFH) from follicular lymphoma (FL) may be a diagnostic challenge and require the use of adjuvant studies. Antibodies to CD10 have been used with flow cytometry and frozen tissue sections and recently have become available for use with paraffin-embedded tissue. We sought to investigate the utility of CD10 in the differentiation of RFH from FL in paraffin-embedded tissue. Twenty-three cases of FL and 19 cases of RFH were evaluated after immunostaining with antibodies to CD3, CD20, BCL2, and CD10 antigens. Intensity of CD10 expression was graded. CD10 expression was present in 87% of cases of FL. Follicles demonstrated strong positivity in 70%. One CD10-positive case of FL showed equivocal staining for BCL2 and one an absence of staining for BCL2. Weaker but definite staining was present in 17%, and 13% were negative for CD10. In contrast, none of the cases of RFH was strongly positive for CD10 expression, with 26% demonstrating weak immunostaining, one case showing equivocal staining, and 68% being entirely negative. CD3, CD20, and BCL2 stained appropriately in all cases. These findings indicate that immunohistochemical staining of paraffin-embedded tissue sections for CD10 may help differentiate reactive from neoplastic follicular lesions.
