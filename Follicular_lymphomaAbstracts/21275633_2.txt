We assessed the efficacy of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab in combination (FCR) as frontline treatment in patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) followed by rituximab maintenance. Seventy-five untreated patients with FL received FCR followed by maintenance with rituximab 375 mg/m(2) weekly during 4 weeks and every 6 months for 2 years. The overall response rate was 100%, with 89% complete remission (CR) and 11% partial remission (PR). Molecular remission was observed in all but one patient. Only eight patients completed all therapy planned. With a median follow-up of 47 months, the 5-year overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and event-free survival (EFS) were 77%, 93%, and 72%, respectively. Age below 60 and low Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) correlated with a better EFS. Ten patients died due to toxic complications. The FCR regimen is highly effective in untreated patients with FL, with 89% CR, including molecular responses, and a low progression rate. However, the high incidence of treatment-related mortality makes this regimen unsafe and it cannot be recommended as an upfront therapy in FL.
