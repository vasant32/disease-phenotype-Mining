Rearrangement of the BCL6 gene is found in follicular lymphomas and in diffuse large B cell lymphomas of follicular center cell origin. The breakpoints cluster mainly in a region spanning the first noncoding exon of the gene (the major breakpoint region). A second breakpoint cluster has also been identified upstream of the first BCL6 noncoding exon (the alternative breakpoint region [ABR]). To date, eight different rearrangements involving the ABR have been reported. Here, we describe a novel rearrangement involving a t(2;3)(p11;q27) translocation that affects the ABR in an unusual combination with the IGK locus.
