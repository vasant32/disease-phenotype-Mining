 BACKGROUND: This phase II CALGB trial evaluated the activity and safety of an extended induction schedule of galiximab (G) plus rituximab (R) in untreated follicular lymphoma (FL). PatieNTS AND METHODS: Patients with previously untreated FL (grades 1, 2, 3a) received 4 weekly infusions of G + R, followed by an additional dose every 2 months four times. International Workshop Response Criteria were used to evaluate response. ResulTS: Sixty-one patients were treated and antibody infusions were well tolerated. The overall response rate (ORR) is 72.1% (95% confidence interval 59.2% to 82.9%): 47.6% complete response (CR)/unconfirmed complete response (CRu) and 24.6% partial response. At a median follow-up time of 4.3 years (range, 0.3-5.3 years) median progression-free survival (PFS) is 2.9 years. Notably, Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) correlated with ORR, CR rate, and PFS, and the low-risk FLIPI group (n = 12) achieved a 92% ORR, 75% CR/CRu rate, and 75% 3-year PFS. CONCLUSIONS: An extended induction schedule of G + R in previously untreated FL is well tolerated and appears particularly efficacious in those patients with low-risk FLIPI scores. In addition, this trial served as the initial platform for additional CALGB 'doublet' combination regimes of rituximab plus other novel targeted agents.
