A woman suffering from primary Sjögren's syndrome developed sensitive neuropathy. The disease was further complicated by follicular lymphoma, an unusual albeit already described complication of Sjögren's disease. The clinical data suggest that mononuclear infiltration of the dorsal root ganglions could be at the origin of a sensitive neuropathy, inducing an axonal degeneration of the nerves.
