Rituximab is a chimeric mouse/human anti-CD20 antibody licensed for the treatment of low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and has recently also been shown to have a role in the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We report a case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome after treatment with rituximab, which occurred in a 36-year-old man with relapsed follicular lymphoma. The patient developed mucositis and fevers after the first two injections, followed by a florid maculopapular rash with severe orogenital ulceration after the third infusion. Over several weeks his symptoms progressed with severe cutaneous, orogenital and conjunctival ulceration, leading to visual problems and malnutrition. No improvement occurred with steroids and immunosuppressant therapy. A review of the literature reveals this to be the first reported case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome associated with rituximab therapy.
