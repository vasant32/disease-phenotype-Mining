A 58-year-old man noticed a right inguinal tumor in 2004. He also recognized a left inguinal tumor in 2006 and entered our hospital. During biopsy of the inguinal lymph node, he was diagnosed with composite lymphoma consisting of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) (nodular sclerosis) and follicular lymphoma (FL) (Grade 2) in the same tissue. Reed-Sternberg cells in the HL region were positive. We could not find evidence to clarify whether these lymphomas were both generated from the same origin in this case. However, examining the origins in this case would be a very significant contribution to understanding these lymphomas.
