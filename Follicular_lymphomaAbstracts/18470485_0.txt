Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index-FLIPI is an established clinical predictor for outcome in follicular lymphoma. The role of molecular abnormalities in blood and bone marrow of follicular lymphoma patients including t(14;18) is less clear. Seventy-five patients from a single institution diagnosed with follicular lymphoma between1999 and 2005 were included into the study. Diagnosis was based on lymph node biopsy in 62 cases (83%). Thirty-nine patients (52%) had G1 histological grade and 47 (63%) had entirely follicular growth pattern, as well as 9 patients (12%) had systemic symptoms and 33 (44%) were assigned to a good risk according to FLIPI. Median age of patients was 53 years. During a median observation time of 3 years 63 patients (84%) required initiating anti-lymphoma treatment. Seventy-five samples of peripheral blood and 65 samples of bone marrow were collected at the diagnosis. Bcl2 rearrangements including major breakpoint region and minor breakpoint cluster region were investigated using nested polymerase chain reaction technique. The primary end points of the study were time to first line lymphoma treatment and progression-free survival. Cells carrying t(14;18) were found in 31 cases (41%) including 29 samples of peripheral blood and 26 samples of bone marrow. Detection of t(14;18) in blood and bone marrow at diagnosis had no influence on clinical outcome. Age, follicular growth pattern systemic symptoms, and FLIPI score above 1 were predictive for initiation of the first lymphoma therapy. Follicular growth pattern, initial nodal involvement, serum LDH level, and FLIPI score above 1 were predictive for longer progression-free survival.
