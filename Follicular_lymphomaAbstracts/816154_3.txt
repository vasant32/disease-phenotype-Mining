The receptor profile of 19 cases of non-Hodgkin lymphocytic lymphoma has been described. In nodular lymphomas, the values commonly fall within normal limits. In 2 cases, the nodules separated from the paranodular tissue contained a proportion of sheep-erythrocyte-rosetting cells as well as fluorescent cells. The diffuse lymphomas show predominance of fluorescent cells but some contain numerous B and T cells. These represent 'co-operative' neoplasms. In 3 cases, a receptor profile characterized by high frequency of surface fluorescence and a low incidence of IgG and EAG receptors was noted; this may represent a pattern for a new subclass of malignant lymphoma. Tumour cells rich in surface fluorescence contained abundant ribosomes. Receptor silence was noted only in a single case.
