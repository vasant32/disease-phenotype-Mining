The authors report a case of acute disseminated lupus erythematosus in a 55 years old patient, receiving small doses of corticosteroids, progressing over three years. During an acute exacerbation of the disease, the development of a cervical adenopathy led to a biopsy. Histological examination revealed a lymphocytic type malignant proliferation (centro-follicular lymphoma). This case is compared with findings reported in the literature and leads to a discussion of the relationship between ADLE and malignant disorders due to a disturbance of immune control mechanisms and the possible role of immune-depressant therapy in their onset.
