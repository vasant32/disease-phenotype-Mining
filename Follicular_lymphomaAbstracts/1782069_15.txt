From 1963 to 1988, 281 patients with newly diagnosed follicular lymphomas were treated and followed at the Foundation Bergoni√©. Distribution of stages was: 72 I, 61 II, 83 III and 65 IV. Within stage III, two subgroups were retrospectively defined: stages III1 (32 cases) included patients with less than 8 involved sites, only 1 or 2 above diaphragm, and no spleen or mediastinal enlargement. Stage III2 (51 cases) included the remaining stage III cases. Median follow-up was 9 years. Complete remission (CR) rate was 82%. 10-year overall survival (OS) and time to treatment failure (TTF) rates were, respectively 38% and 29.5%. 10-year time to relapse (TTR) rate was 36%. Statistical analyses showed concordant results with two main prognostic factors: age (less than 60/greater than 60) and stage (I to III1/III2 and IV). Age was the most important factor for OS analysis and stage for CR and TTR analysis. This leads to only three prognostic groups with different outcome. The first includes younger patients (less than 60 years) with limited stages (less than or equal to III1); the second, patients either older than 60 or with advanced stages; the last, elderly patients with advanced stages. CR rates of these three groups were, respectively 97%, 75% and 57%. 10-year OS were, respectively 73.5%, 27% and 0%; 10-year TTR were 54%, 22% and 0%. These results have lead to data which are easy to handle and which can help to establish a rationale for further prospective trials.
