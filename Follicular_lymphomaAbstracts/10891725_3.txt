Primary renal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is unusual, in contrast to the frequent renal involvement in disseminated NHL. We report a case of follicular lymphoma presenting initially as a renal mass. In the literature, twenty-seven similar cases have been described since 1980. The median age at diagnosis is 64 years with a male predominance. Clinical and radiological findings generally evoke renal carcinoma. Histologically, tumors are usually large B-cell lymphomas. The existence of renal non-Hodgkin lymphoma mimicking renal carcinoma must be recognized. Such lymphomas can either be primitive or be nodal with a renal presentation. Nephrectomy followed by chemotherapy permits long disease free survival.
