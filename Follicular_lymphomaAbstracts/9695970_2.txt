We report four patients with relapsed or refractory follicular (three) and lymphoplasmacytic (one) lymphoma who achieved complete remission (CR) with fludarabine (FDR) lasting from 3.2 to 6 years. One had stage III and three stage IV and were resistant to chlorambucil and/or anthracycline. FDR was well tolerated, the only complication being herpes zoster infection in three patients, which was controlled with aciclovir. One patient developed a gastric MALT lymphoma from a different clone than the follicular lymphoma. In conclusion, some patients with refractory low-grade lymphoma achieve long-term CR with FDR: therefore this agent may be considered as alternative to stem-cell transplantation.
