We analyzed the outcomes of 283 patients receiving unrelated donor allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) facilitated by the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research/National Marrow Donor Program (CIBMTR/NMDP) between 1991 and 2004. All patients received myeloablative conditioning regimens. The median follow-up of survivors is 5 years. Seventy-three (26%) patients are alive. The day 100 probability of death from all causes is estimated at 39%. The cumulative incidence of developing grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) at day 100 is 25%. The estimated 5-year survival and failure free survival are 24% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 19-30) and 22% (95% CI: 17-28), respectively. Factors adversely associated with overall survival (OS) included increasing age, decreased performance status, and refractory disease. Follicular lymphoma (FL) and peripheral T cell lymphoma had improved survival compared to aggressive B cell lymphomas. Factors adversely associated with progression-free survival (PFS) included performance status, histology, and disease status at transplant. Long-term failure-free survival is possible following unrelated donor transplantation for NHL, although early mortality was high in this large cohort.
