The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of quantitative real-time PCR (RQ-PCR) for the monitoring of molecular remission in follicular lymphoma (FL) patients during long-term follow-up. RQ-PCR by the use of TaqMan detection system is a sensitive tool to monitor minimal residual disease (MRD) in FL through amplification of the t(14;18) fusion gene during and post-therapy. In most cases the breakpoint region occurs within the major breakpoint region (MBR). Among 75 patients diagnosed with FL, cells harboring the fusion gene BCL2/JH were found in peripheral blood of 31 patients (41%). We further monitored 30 of these patients in a period varying from 6 months to 5 years by RQ-PCR. In our study the level indicating the possibility of the presence of MRD was established at more than five t(14;18)-positive cells in the background of 83,000 normal cells. The results of this work also confirmed that the presence of MRD detected by RQ-PCR is an indication for careful observation of patients because of a higher risk of disease recurrence.
