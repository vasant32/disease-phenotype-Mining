OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: epidural localization is a rare presenting sign of non Hodgkin's lymphoma. In this study, we describe the clinical, histological and immunohistochemical data in 13 cases (9 men and 4 women) of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with epidural involvement. RESULTS: the median age was 63 years (range 36-76 years). Clinically, most patients complained of back pain (median duration, 3.4 months) followed by acute neurological deterioration. In 10 out of 13 tumors, a thoracic localization was observed and a decompressive laminectomy was performed in all cases. Histology and immunohistochemistry showed all tumors to be B-cell lymphomas which were classified as: lymphocytic lymphoma (3 cases), prolymphocytic lymphoma (1 case), follicular lymphoma (2 cases), diffuse large cell lymphoma (6 cases) and AIDS associated Burkitt lymphoma (1 case). Post-operative staging revealed bone and/or paravertebral involvement in 11 cases and disseminated disease in 5 cases. Median survival following complementary therapy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy in most cases, was 20 months. CONCLUSION: histological features of epidural lymphomas are similar to other extranodal lymphomas and their prognosis is better than other epidural neoplasms, especially when the tumor is localized.
