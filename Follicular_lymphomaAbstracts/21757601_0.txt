Recently, several reports have described cases of "in situ" mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in which scattered cyclin D1+ cells were present within the mantle zones of reactive-appearing lymphoid follicles. In this report, we describe an unusual histologic pattern of in situ MCL that was identified in a staging lymph node for colonic adenocarcinoma resected 4 years before a diagnosis of symptomatic MCL. Retrospective immunohistochemical studies showed scattered cyclin D1-expressing cells within otherwise reactive germinal centers but not in the surrounding mantle zones. The presence of early MCL cells limited to reactive germinal centers represents a novel "follicular in situ" growth pattern for MCL, which overlaps morphologically with reactive follicular hyperplasia and follicular lymphoma and which could have implications for MCL pathogenesis.
