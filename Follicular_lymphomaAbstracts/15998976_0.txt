During the past decade, considerable advances have been made in the sensitivity of detection of residual lymphoma and leukemia cells. In particular, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays are capable of detecting one tumor cell in as many as 106 normal cells. The applicability of these techniques has been made possible by the identification and cloning of the breakpoints associated with specific chromosomal translocations associated with particular subtypes of lymphoma, best studied for the t(14;18), which occurs in most cases of follicular lymphoma. Although we are approaching the time when PCR-based methods of detection of minimal residual lymphoma detection become a routine part of staging, both at diagnosis and after therapy, it is not yet possible to determine whether the detection of residual lymphoma cells by PCR is an indication to continue therapy. Therefore, although these techniques provide a useful adjunct to standard methods of detection and diagnosis, their role in staging of disease outcome remains investigational.
