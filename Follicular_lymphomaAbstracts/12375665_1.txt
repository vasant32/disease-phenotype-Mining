BACKGROUND: Malignant cells may contribute to relapse after autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation The effectiveness of a double immunomagnetic purging strategy combining CD34-positive with B-negative cell selection to purge peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) from patients with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders has been analyzed. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-two CD34+ cell selections from patients with follicular lymphoma (n = 14), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 6), mantle cell lymphoma (n = 1), and splenic marginal zone lymphoma (n = 1) were performed by use of a magnetic cell selector followed by a negative cell selection step with anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody bound to immunomagnetic beads. RESULTS: The PBPC components contained median CD34+ cells of 1.24 percent (range, 0.38-3.92%) and CD19+ cells of 1.83 percent (range, 0.06-69.7%). After positive selection (n = 22), 49 percent (range, 16-72%) of CD34+ cells were recovered with a purity of 93 percent (range, 24-99%). The double-positive and -negative selections (n = 20) yielded 57.5 percent of CD34+ cells (range, 33.4-79.4%) with a purity of 95 percent (range, 63-99%). Logarithms of B-cell reduction in the CD34+-cell-enriched B-cell-depleted component had a median value of 3.63 (range, 2.74-4.84 log) and CD19+ and CD5+ cells for chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with more than 4.56 log (>3.6-5.6 log). Of 13 PBPC components that had a tumor-specific clonal signal, 10 became PCR negative after the double-selection procedure. CONCLUSION: Combined positive and negative magnetic cell selection achieves a high grade of tumor cell reduction with up to 77 percent of the grafts being negative for tumor-specific clonal signal by PCR analysis. This technique preserves an adequate recovery of progenitor cells able to engraft.
