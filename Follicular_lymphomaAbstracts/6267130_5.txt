We have studied the specificity of complement receptors induced by theophylline in 2 cell lines derived from undifferentiated lymphomas, one of Burkitt's type, and compared it to that of complement receptors in other cell types. Both C3b and C3d receptors were induced. The induced C3b receptor differed from the C3b receptor of mature normal lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes and the cells of a nodular lymphoma in 2 respects. Firstly, it bound C3b much less avidly (by a factor of several hundred-fold) and secondly, we were unable to demonstrate C4b binding. EBV receptors were induced at the same time as complement receptors, and permitted the conversion of a greater fraction of cells to EBNA positivity after experimental infection with EBV. The induction of receptors was not associated with a change in the fluidity of the plasma membranes and our data do not favor a different orientation of induced receptors within the membrane as compared to receptors of other cell types--a potential explanation for the different specificities. Our findings are consistent with the possibility that the complement receptors of lymphocyte precursors differ from these of mature lymphocytes.
