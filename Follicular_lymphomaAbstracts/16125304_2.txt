Mutations in the 5'-regulatory region of BCL6 were suggested to play a role in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) progression and in the transformation of follicular lymphoma to more aggressive diffuse large B-cell type. The aim of this study was to explore association between polymorphism G397C in the 5'-region of BCL6 and both incidence and progression of NHL in 154 NHL cases and 362 controls. Neither frequencies of the rare BCL6 allele 397C nor particular genotypes differed significantly between NHL cases and controls. There was no significant association of histological type of NHL and clinical characteristics with this polymorphism.
