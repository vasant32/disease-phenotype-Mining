Transcription factors (TFs) are critical for B-cell differentiation, affecting gene expression both by repression and transcriptional activation. Still, this information is not used for classification of B-cell lymphomas (BCLs). Traditionally, BCLs are diagnosed based on a phenotypic resemblance to normal B-cells; assessed by immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry, by using a handful of phenotypic markers. In the last decade, diagnostic and prognostic evaluation has been facilitated by global gene expression profiling (GEP), providing a new powerful means for the classification, prediction of survival, and response to treatment of lymphomas. However, most GEP studies have typically been performed on whole tissue samples, containing varying degrees of tumor cell content, which results in uncertainties in data analysis. In this study, global GEP analyses were performed on highly purified, flow-cytometry sorted tumor-cells from eight subgroups of BCLs. This enabled identification of TFs that can be uniquely associated to the tumor cells of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), hairy cell leukemia (HCL), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The identified transcription factors influence both the global and specific gene expression of the BCLs and have possible implications for diagnosis and treatment.
