Fifty formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded cases of T-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) from 12 bone marrow trephines and 38 lymph nodes were stained with a new monoclonal antibody, 2TL 242, raised against recombinant TAL1 protein. The antibody recognizes TAL-1 polypeptides of molecular weight 39 and 41 kD (full length). In addition, a variety of other leukaemias and lymphomas were also stained with 2TL 242. Twenty-four of the 50 cases of T-ALL showed nuclear positivity, ranging from 10 to 90 per cent of leukaemic cells. A positive staining reaction was nuclear and stippled in pattern. Nuclear staining was not seen in any other type of leukaemia or lymphoma. Five cases of follicular lymphoma showed diffuse cytoplasmic staining of variable intensity. Although some background staining is obtained with this antibody, positive nuclear staining is easily distinguishable. This monoclonal antibody has a potential role in primary diagnosis and in the detection of minimal residual disease in T-ALL.
