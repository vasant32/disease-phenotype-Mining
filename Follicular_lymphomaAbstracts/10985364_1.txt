In most cases of follicular lymphoma, t(14;18) chromosomal translocation can be detected in lymphocytes of peripheral blood and bone marrow. Nevertheless, certain other types of diseases can also be characterised by the presence of the translocation. Patients of Sjogren's syndrome have an increased frequency of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, e.g. follicular lymphoma; in turn, they may have translocation-bearing cells. One hundred Sjögren's syndrome patients were screened using a nested polymerase chain reaction technique to identify whether they had the translocation in their peripheral blood lymphocytes. Five percent of that population revealed a temporary or long-lasting presence of the translocation, sometimes even in the lymphocytes from bone marrow. Our results indicate that in addition to the conventional diagnostic methods of lymphoma, there are certain other factors, e.g. the duration of the presence of t(14; 18) translocation and the source of lymphocytes, that should be considered for successful early diagnoses and perhaps for treatment of the lymphoma in the Sjögren's patients.
