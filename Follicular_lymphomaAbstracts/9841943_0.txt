AIM: To analyze the bone marrow (BM) infiltration in low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (LGNHL) and assess its association with the histopathology type, clinical behavior, and disease prognosis. METHOD: BM smears obtained by needle biopsy and stained by standard methods were analyzed in 60 patients with LGNHL using the Working Formulation. RESULTS: BM infiltration was observed in 57% of the lymphocytic lymphomas (A), in 48% of lymphoplasmocytic/ plasmocytoid lymphomas (AI), and in 31% of follicular lymphomas (follicular small cleaved cell and follicular mixed B and C). The difference was not significant. The 5-year survival rates for patients with and without bone marrow infiltration were 53% and 56% respectively, and 10-year survival rates were 31% and 45% (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: The presence of bone marrow infiltration at diagnosis did not significantly affect the prognosis of LGNHL.
