(1) Rituximab is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsed or chemoresistant stage III-IV follicular lymphoma.  (2) The clinical file is currently limited to 300 patients treated in non comparative trials.  (3) Four infusions of rituximab, at a dose of 375 mg/m2/week, led to at least a partial tumour response in 50% of these poor-prognosis patients, and prevented disease progression for more than nine months in the responders (median value not yet reached). (4) Adverse reactions are frequent and sometimes severe during the first infusion.
