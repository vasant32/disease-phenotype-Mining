We report a case of follicular lymphoma in a healthy individual, which presented as saliva- and serum-proven mumps. The patient presented with a sore throat and parotid and submandibular lymphadenopathy. Fine needle aspiration, undertaken three weeks following presentation, revealed no malignant cells. An excision biopsy of a level two node was performed due to persistent lymphadenopathy, five weeks following presentation. As far as we are aware, this is the first reported case of follicular lymphoma presenting as mumps. This case highlights the importance of follow up in patients in whom lymphadenopathy is persistent despite the proven diagnosis of mumps.
