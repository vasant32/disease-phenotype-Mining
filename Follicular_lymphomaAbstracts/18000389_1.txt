Rearrangements involving the IGH gene have been identified in about 50% of non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas (NHLs) and correlated to clinically relevant subgroups. However, the detection rate largely varied with the technique used. We analyzed the incidence of IGH rearrangements using several fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques on metaphases obtained from 96 patients with nodal NHL. An IGH rearrangement was identified in 71 cases (74%). A t(14;18)(q32;q21) was found in 37 of the 42 follicular lymphomas (88.1%) studied and a t(11;14)(q13;q32) in 12 of the 14 mantle cell lymphomas (85.7%). IGH rearrangements were identified in 21 of the 40 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (52.5%), including seven t(14;18)(q32;q21) and four t(3;14)(q27;q32). Conventional cytogenetics was uninformative in several cases. However, the complemented analysis using 24-color FISH, chromosomal whole paints, telomeric probes and locus specific identifiers enabled us to characterize complex and/or masked IGH translocations in follicular lymphomas and mantle cell lymphomas and to identify all the chromosomal partners involved in IGH rearrangements in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. This study shows the interest of using metaphase FISH in addition to conventional cytogenetics. Following banding techniques, FISH with the IGH dual color probe can be the first approach in NHL, after which chromosome painting and 24-color FISH can be used to identify the chromosomal partners involved in IGH rearrangements. The identification of these genes is of utmost importance for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the genesis of lymphoma.
