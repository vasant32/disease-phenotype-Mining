The combination of bortezomib and rituximab was evaluated in patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), follicular lymphoma (FL) and Waldenström macroglobulinaemia (WM), in a Phase I and later, a randomized Phase II study. In the randomized study, 42 patients with recurrent/refractory disease received either: bortezomib 1·3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 of a 3-week cycle with rituximab 375 mg/m(2) on day 1 (21 patients) or: bortezomib 1·6 mg/m(2) and rituximab on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of a 5-week cycle (with rituximab being given only in cycles 1 and 4).Twenty-eight patients were withdrawn (toxicity 16, progression 7, and 'patient choice' 5). The main toxicities were neurological, gastro-intestinal and haematological. The overall response rate was 28/42(67%) and by histology: MCL 11/19, FL 8/15, and WM 9/10. Ten of 28 responding patients remained progression-free at 1-3·5 years. Toxicity and efficacy were equivalent between the two groups. The combination has significant toxicity but is effective, particularly in patients with WM.
