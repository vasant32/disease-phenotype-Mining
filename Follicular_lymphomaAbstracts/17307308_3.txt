We evaluated the deposition of C4d in follicular lymphomas (FL) and extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma). Deposition of C4d was detected in 118 lymphoma tissues from patients with lymphoma and in 20 reactive hyperplasia lymphadens (RHL) using immunohistochemistical methods. FL, MALT lymphoma, and RHL were studied using double staining for CD35/C4d and Bcl-2/C4d. We studied 26 FL tissues, 19 of which showed C4d deposition. C4d deposition was detected around the follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) in the neoplastic follicles. There was no significant difference between the positive ratio of C4d and the grades of FL. We studied 12 MALT lymphoma tissues, six of which displayed C4d deposition. In these tissues, C4d deposition was detected in the peripheral region of partially colonized follicles in the form of an irregular ring, but was not found in the central region. C4d deposition was negative in completely colonized follicles. There was no C4d deposition in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, mantle cell lymphomas, B-small lymphocytic lymphomas, T-lymphoblastic lymphomas, peripheral T-cell lymphomas, and anaplastic large cell lymphomas. C4d around the FDCs in the neoplastic follicles was a specific indicator for FL. C4d deposition in partially colonized follicles of MALT lymphoma was completely different from that in neoplastic follicles of FL, forming a key point for differential diagnosis.
