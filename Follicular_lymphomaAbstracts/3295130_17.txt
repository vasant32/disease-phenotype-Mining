From 1975 to 1982, 74 patients with stage III follicular lymphoma were treated with a combined modality protocol which included chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and bleomycin (CHOP-Bleo), and radiotherapy to involved regions. This program resulted in a complete remission (CR) rate of 81%, a 5-year survival of 75%, and 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) of 52% for all patients. Analysis of potential factors affecting treatment outcome revealed a significantly better CR rate for patients with small cleaved cell type (97%) than for patients with mixed (73%) or large-cell (57%) histologies. The 5-year survival was significantly better for patients with small cleaved (91%) and mixed (84%) cell types than for large cell (40%). In addition, bulky abdominal disease and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were significant adverse prognostic factors for CR and for survival. Toxicity was moderate. No secondary leukemias have occurred. This combined modality regimen resulted in prolonged remission and potential cure for over half of patients who achieved CR, and is particularly encouraging for those with follicular small cleaved and mixed histologies.
