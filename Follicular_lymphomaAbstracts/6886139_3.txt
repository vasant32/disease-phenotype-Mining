The experience of one institution using abdominal computed tomography (CT) for staging and restaging of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients is reported. In 49% of abnormal examinations no significant difference in quantity of involved nodes between diffuse and nodular lymphomas appeared. High paraaortic, iliac, and mesenteric nodal sites were most commonly involved. At restaging examination, usually less extent of disease was found. Abdominal involvement could not be predicted from the presence of peripheral adenopathy. Computed tomography changed the staged during initial workup significantly in 14%. During restaging, CT detected unsuspected active disease in 43% and changed the clinical impression from limited to extensive involvement in 16%. Computed tomography proved to be useful in the management of NHL patients and is recommended as the primary imaging procedure in the abdomen in this disease.
