Given the rarity of follicular lymphoma (FL) in children, there is limited data on which to base treatment recommendations. Herein, we report our institutional experience of using rituximab with multiagent chemotherapy for pediatric FL. Six pediatric patients were diagnosed with FL from 2000 to 2009. All patients received rituximab in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) for varying durations. Five of the six patients remain in remission with a median follow-up of 31 months. Larger randomized trials are indicated to establish the efficacy of this regimen for pediatric FL patients.
