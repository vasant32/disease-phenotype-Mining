Three patients had diffuse enlargement of skeletal muscle of the thigh as the result of infiltration by diffuse large-cell lymphoma. One case presented de novo as diffuse lymphoma, but the other two had previous diagnoses of nodular lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease. Computed tomographic scanning disclosed an enhancing mass in the thigh with infiltration of skeletal muscle groups; abnormal medullary cavities were noted in the adjacent long bones. Muscle biopsy established the diagnosis in two of the patients.
