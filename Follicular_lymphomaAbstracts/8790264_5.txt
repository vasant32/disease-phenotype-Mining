Angiotropic large cell lymphoma is a rare, aggressive type of malignant lymphoma that primarily involves intravascular spaces and most often has clinical manifestations in the skin and central nervous system. Virtually any organ can be affected, however, including the lymph nodes and spleen. Peripheral blood involvement is usually not detectable morphologically. Conventional lymphoma in association with this entity has also been described. Herein we present a case of angiotropic lymphoma of B-cell lineage that affected the liver and skin. Reanalysis of a lymph node specimen that had been excised 3 years previously demonstrated a follicular small cleaved cell lymphoma. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of possible evolution of follicular lymphoma to large cell lymphoma of angiotropic type.
