We retrospectively evaluated the association of the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) and other characteristics with survival following high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in 207 consecutive follicular lymphoma (FL) patients. The FLIPI was associated with OS both when evaluated as a categorical variable (0 - 1 vs. 2 vs. 3 vs. 4, p = 0.01, global test) and a continuous linear variable (p = 0.002). The association of FLIPI with survival appeared to be more relevant for patients who received standard conditioning regimens compared to those that were treated with high-dose radioimmunotherapy (p = 0.004). Among all patients, mortality was also associated with chemosensitive disease (HR = 0.47, p = 0.01) or untreated relapse (HR = 0.20, p = 0.0002) vs. chemoresistant disease, and > or =2 extranodal sites (HR = 2.82, p = 0.03) after adjusting for FLIPI. These data suggest that the FLIPI and select non-FLIPI factors after adjustment for the FLIPI are associated with survival in FL patients undergoing ASCT.
