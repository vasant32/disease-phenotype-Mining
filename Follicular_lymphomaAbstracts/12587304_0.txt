A comprehensive clinical-and-laboratory examination of patients with non-Hodgkin's malignant lymphomas revealed a lack of correspondence between results of histological and immunophenotypical investigations. The most characteristic feature appeared to be the presence of CD10, CD11a, and CD35 antigens. Absence of CD95 antigen on tumour cells is regarded as an unfavourable prognostic sign in patients with follicular lymphomas as is presence of CD10 antigen on the above cells.
