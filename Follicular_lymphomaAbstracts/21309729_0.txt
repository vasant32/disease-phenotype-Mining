 BACKGROUND: The determination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification product sizes of the Bcl-2/IgH fusion gene from follicular lymphoma (FL) provides evidence of clonal identity. METHODS: The present study describes detection of Bcl-2/IgH fusion gene clonality utilizing a small, simple microcapillary electrophoretic chip combined with a real-time PCR method. RESULTS: The microcapillary electrophoretic chip system effectively detects size differences among the Bcl-2/IgH fusion gene amplification products of FL from patient samples; something that is not possible using traditional gel electrophoresis. We also describe the potential of this system to utilize formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples sectioned on charged slides. CONCLUSIONS: The simple detection of Bcl-2/IgH fusion gene clonality using a microcapillary electrophoretic chip provides reliable information for monitoring minimal residual disease of FL, and can be an effective tool for use in clinical laboratories.
