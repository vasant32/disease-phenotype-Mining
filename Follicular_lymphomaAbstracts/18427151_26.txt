 PURPOSE: We hypothesized that granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) could potentiate the clinical activity of rituximab given its individual and cooperative effects on Fc gamma RIIa- and Fc gamma RIIIa-expressing cells. A phase II clinical study combining GM-CSF and rituximab was initiated in patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma (FL) to determine the clinical and biologic responses, as well as safety of the combination. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty three patients with relapsed FL were treated with GM-CSF 5 microg/kg/d on days 1 to 8 and rituximab 375 mg/m(2) on day 5 of each 21-day cycle for four cycles. Clinical response and tolerability were examined according to international criteria. Biologic monitoring included evaluation of immune cells involved in rituximab activity. RESULTS: Of 33 evaluated patients, a 70% overall response rate (complete response plus complete response unconfirmed, 45%) and a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 16.5 months were achieved. Outcome was influenced by the quality of response and the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI), where low- and intermediate-risk FLIPI groups were associated with significantly better PFS. After treatment there was a significant increase in granulocyte and monocyte counts. Examination of dendritic cell response showed an overall increase in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, especially in non-complete response patients, after treatment. Addition of GM-CSF did not impair tolerance to rituximab, and adverse events were rare and mild. DISCUSSION: GM-CSF plus rituximab results in high response rates, along with a tolerable safety profile in patients with relapsed or progressive FL. The improved efficacy over rituximab monotherapy may be due to increases seen in monocyte, granulocyte, and dendritic cell populations.
