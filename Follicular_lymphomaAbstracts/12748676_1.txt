We report the case of a t(14:18)(+) follicular lymphoma (FL) patient in long-term clinical remission after undergoing an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donor who was the normal healthy carrier of a t(14:18)(+) B cell clone. Using real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) and gel electrophoresis, we document the temporal disappearance of the patient's t(14:18)(+) clone early post-transplant with the concomitant emergence and long-term persistence of the donor's t(14:18)(+) clone in the patient's peripheral blood. This report indicates that the use of PCR-based techniques to measure minimal residual disease in FL patients post-alloBMT should incorporate pretransplant screening of the donor for t(14;18). Furthermore, it suggests that healthy individuals with t(14:18) need not be excluded as donors for FL patients treated with allo-BMT.
