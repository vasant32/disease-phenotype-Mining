Rearrangements involving the BCL6 gene are found in 30% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs). We evaluated the clinical characteristics and prognoses of patients with B-cell lymphoma carrying 3q27 translocations. Among the 59 patients having 3q27 translocation, 10.9% had follicular lymphoma (FL) and 23.1% had DLBCL. It is of interest that the prognostic significance was not found between FL and DLBCL with 3q27 translocations. Progression-free survival (PFS) rate was significantly higher in the FL patients with 3q27 translocation than in those with 18q21 translocation. PFS rate was significantly higher in the DLBCL patients with 3q27 translocation than in those with 18q21 translocation. These findings suggest that the presence of 3q27 translocation is a significant prognostic factor in DLBCL.
