A multi-centre hospital-based case-control study was conducted in three regions of France between 2000 and 2003 in order to establish the risk factors of lymphoid neoplasms. We report here results concerning alcohol and tobacco consumption. A total of 298 cases and 276 controls, case-matched by inclusion centre, age and sex were included. Cases were classified according to the World Health Organization classification and validated by an expert panel of eight pathologists. Overall alcohol intake did not incur any risk increase for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Wine consumption marginally increased the risk of follicular lymphoma [odds ratio=2.19 (0.83-5.80)], with a higher risk for drinkers who started before the age of 20 years [odds ratio=4.04 (1.19-13.76)] and for drinkers who consumed more than 19 g of alcohol per day [odds ratio=4.37 (1.04-18.45)]. Beer and spirit consumption was not linked to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma risk. Tobacco consumption did not show a risk increase. The risk increase of follicular lymphoma due to wine consumption was new. We discuss this risk based on the French context, France being the European country with the highest alcohol consumption, particularly of wine.
