Chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1) is a G protein-coupled receptor that binds to members of the C-C chemokine family. Recently, CCL3 (MIP-1alpha), a high-affinity CCR1 ligand, was identified as part of a model that independently predicts survival in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). However, the role of chemokine signaling in the pathogenesis of human lymphomas is unclear. In normal human hematopoietic tissues, we found CCR1 expression in intraepithelial B cells of human tonsil and granulocytic/monocytic cells in the bone marrow. Immunohistochemical analysis of 944 cases of hematolymphoid neoplasia identified CCR1 expression in a subset of B- and T-cell lymphomas, plasma cell myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, and classical Hodgkin lymphoma. CCR1 expression correlated with the non-germinal center subtype of DLBCL but did not predict overall survival in follicular lymphoma. These data suggest that CCR1 may be useful for lymphoma classification and support a role for chemokine signaling in the pathogenesis of hematolymphoid neoplasia.
