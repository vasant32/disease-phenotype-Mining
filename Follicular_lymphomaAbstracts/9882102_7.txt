The translocation t(14;18)(q32;q21), characteristic for follicular lymphomas and a subset of diffuse large cell lymphomas, juxtaposes the bcl-2 proto-oncogene with the Ig heavy-chain (IgH) gene. This results in deregulation of the bcl-2 gene expression and elevation of BCL-2 protein, which protects the cells against induction of programmed cell death and, thus, confers a survival advantage leading to immortalization of t(14;18)-carrying cells. The acquisition of additional chromosomal aberrations is necessary for the malignant transformation and clonal progression of BCL-2 overexpressing lymphocytes. These secondary changes can be observed by karyotyping in more than 90% of lymphomas with t(14;18).1,2
