We previously reported a strong IL4I1 gene expression in primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) and recently identified the protein as a secreted L-phenylalanine oxidase, physiologically expressed by myeloid cells, which inhibits T-cell proliferation in vitro. Here, we analyzed the pattern of IL4I1 protein expression in 315 human lymphoid and non-lymphoid malignancies. Besides PMBL, IL4I1 expression in tumors was very frequent. IL4I1 was detected in tumor-associated macrophages from most of the tumors and in neoplastic cells from follicular lymphoma, classic and nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphomas and small lymphocytic lymphoma, three of which are germinal center derived. IL4I1-positive tumor cells were also detected in rare cases of solid cancers, mainly mesothelioma. The enzymatic activity paralleled protein expression, suggesting that IL4I1 is functional in vivo. Depending on the tumor type, IL4I1 may impact on different infiltrating lymphocyte populations with consequences on tumor evolution. In the particular case of follicular lymphoma cells, which are susceptible to antitumor cytotoxic T cells killing but depend on interactions with local T helper cells for survival, a high level of IL4I1 expression seems associated with the absence of bone marrow involvement and a better outcome. These findings plead for an evaluation of IL4I1 as a prognosis factor.
