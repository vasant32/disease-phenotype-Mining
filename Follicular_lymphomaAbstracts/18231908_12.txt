The addition of rituximab to cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone (CVP) for advanced follicular lymphoma increases median time to progression by 17 months. A US societal cost-effectiveness of R-CVP versus CVP is estimated for a representative 50-year-old patient. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival are based on a randomized Phase III trial. Costs are estimated using Medicare reimbursement rates and published drug price data, and include drug and administration costs, adverse events, treatment of relapses, and end-of-life care. Utility estimates are derived from the literature and a 3% discount rate is employed. Mean overall survival is projected to be 1.51 years longer for patients assigned to R-CVP versus CVP. The cost per quality-adjusted year of life gained is $28,565. The utility associated with stable or progressive disease and the unit drug cost of rituximab most influence the findings. The cost-effectiveness ratio of R-CVP compared with CVP is projected to be cost-effective in the United States under a range of sensitivity analyses.
