We report the results of a study in previously untreated advanced stage patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) who underwent uniform induction chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) followed by myeloablative therapy and anti-B-cell monoclonal antibody purged autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT). Eighty-three patients with previously untreated, low-grade FL were enrolled. After CHOP induction, only 36% achieved complete remission (CR) and 77 patients underwent ABMT. Before BM harvest, 70 patients had a known t(14;18), as determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and all remained PCR positive in the BM at harvest. After ABMT, the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival are estimated to be 63% and 89% at 3 years, respectively, with a median follow-up of 45 months. Patients whose BM was PCR negative after purging experienced significantly longer freedom from recurrence (FFR) than those whose BM remained PCR positive (P = .0006). Continued PCR negativity in follow-up BM samples was also strongly predictive of continued CR. This study suggests that a subset of patients with advanced FL may experience prolonged clinical and molecular remissions following high-dose ablative therapy, although longer follow-up will be necessary to determine potential impact on overall survival.
