Patients with high-relapse-risk lymphomas or those relapsing after initial therapy have a limited probability of cure with conventional treatment. There is recent inconclusive evidence that, in such cases, intensification or salvage treatment with high-dose chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) increases the response rate and may improve survival. Nevertheless, published data on long-term follow-up of high-risk lymphoma patients treated with HSCT are scarce. We analyzed 101 consecutive patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy followed by HSCT after induction with standard chemotherapy. The median age was 38 years (range, 12-63 years). The diagnoses were Hodgkin's disease (n = 32), follicular lymphoma (n = 33), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 12), mantle cell lymphoma (n = 7), T-cell lymphoma (n = 14), and others (n = 3). Patients received either an autologous graft (n = 72) in first complete remission (1CR; n = 23) or in advanced stages (AS; n = 49), or an allogeneic graft (n = 29) in 1CR (n = 7) or in AS (n = 22). We concluded that transplant-related mortality was 2.7% for patients receiving an autologous HSCT and 27% for patients receiving an allogeneic HSCT. The main etiologies were graft-versus-host disease and infection in the allogeneic setting, and infection in the autologous setting. The probability of long-term (12-year) overall survival was 71%, higher than that described for high-relapse-risk lymphoma patients treated without HSCT and significantly better (P < .05) for patients who received the transplant in 1CR (89%) than in AS (65%). Finally, the probability of long-term survival was significantly better for patients treated with HSCT during the period from 2000-2007 (85%) compared with the period from 1989-1999 (72%).
