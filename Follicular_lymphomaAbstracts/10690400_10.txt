Twenty-five patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were treated by combination chemotherapy with irinotecan hydrochloride (CPT-11) and adriamycin (ADM): CPT-11, 25 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2; ADM, 40 mg/m2 on day 3. Nine (36%) of twenty-five patients achieved CR. Fairly good responses were seen in relapsed B-cell lymphomas (4 of 8 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and 2 of 2 in follicular lymphoma grade 1), and substantial responses in T-cell lymphomas (1 of 4 in peripheral T-cell lymphoma and 2 of 7 in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma). Leukopenia was frequent but tolerable, and diarrhea minimal. Combination chemotherapy with a reduced dose CPT-11 and ADM was useful in the treatment of relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
