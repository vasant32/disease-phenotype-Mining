The TNF-family molecule, RANKL, is a key regulator of bone remodeling and essential for the development and activation of osteoclasis. Bone involvement signals diesease activity in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and influences the progenesis. The molecular mechanism and soluble factors involved in osteoclastic activation in haematological malignancies remain unclear except for Multiple Myeloma and Adult T-cell Leukemia. The aim of this paper is to report the first case of Follicular Lymphoma with bone involvement displaying an aberrant expression of RANKL in malignant cells. The detection of RANKL in Follicullar Lymphoma may help to prevent bone lesion in patients by determining an appropriate treatment.
