The clinical behavior and optimal treatment of patients presenting with skin infiltration by B-cell lymphoma have not been established. To clarify this we assessed the clinical and laboratory features of 51 patients presenting with cutaneous infiltration by B-cell lymphoma. Follow-up data was available for 46 patients with a median age of 68 years (range 16-89 years) and a median follow-up of 32.5 months (range 5-123 months). Thirty-three of 51 (65%) patients had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and 15/51 (29%) had marginal zone lymphoma (MZL). The remaining 3 patients had follicular lymphoma, CLL, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. Of the 33 patients with DLBCL, follow-up was available in 29; 24/29 (83%) had primary cutaneous disease, which was unifocal in 17/24 (71%). Following treatment, 8/24 (33%) of the primary cases relapsed. Of the 8 who relapsed, 7 had received local forms of treatment only. Follow-up data was available in 14/15 patients with MZL. 11/14 (79%) had primary cutaneous disease, which was unifocal in 8 (73%). Following treatment, 4 of these cases relapsed (36%); all had received local therapy only. It is evident from this study that a significant proportion ( reverse similar 20%) of patients who present with cutaneous infiltration by B-cell lymphoma have systemic disease. Staging is therefore mandatory in these patients. Approximately 1/3 patients with primary cutaneous DLBCL or MZL ultimately relapse, and relapse rates appear higher in those patients receiving local therapy only. Systemic or combined modality therapy may therefore be the most appropriate treatment at presentation. This should be assessed prospectively in randomized trials.
