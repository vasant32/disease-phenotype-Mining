 PURPOSE: Fludarabine monophosphate (FAMP) is a major drug in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and showed efficacy in selected groups of patients with low-grade lymphomas, most of them pretreated. The aim of this trial was to assess the efficacy and the toxicity of FAMP in untreated patients with follicular lymphoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-four untreated patients with advanced follicular lymphoma were treated with intravenous (i.v.) fludarabine at a dose of 25 mg/m2/d during 5 days every 4 weeks, to a maximum of nine cycles. RESULTS: The toxicity of the drug was mild, mainly granulocytic. Granulocytopenia > or = 3 (World Health Organization [WHO]) was observed during 48 of 328 cycles (14.6%) and in 22 of 53 (41%) patients assessable for toxicity. Fludarabine had to be stopped prematurely because of toxicity in nine patients: marrow toxicity in five, peripheral neuropathy in two, and interstitial pneumonitis and hepatitis in one patient each. Among 49 patients assessable for response, the overall response rate was 65% and the complete response (CR) rate 37%. The median progression-free survival interval for all patients was 13.6 months. CONCLUSION: These results confirm that fludarabine is active when used as first-line treatment in patients with follicular lymphoma and has a low toxicity rate. It may be used as single treatment in elderly patients. Associations of fludarabine with other drugs active against follicular lymphoma need to be determined.
