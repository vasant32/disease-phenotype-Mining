The aims of this study were to compare the detection rates of gastrointestinal follicular lymphoma lesions by video capsule endoscopy (VCE) and double-balloon endoscopy (DBE), and to determine the pathologic diagnostic yields of DBE-directed biopsies. A total of 27 consecutive patients were enrolled. No significant difference in detection rates was observed in 12 patients who underwent total enteroscopy at both VCE and DBE. Pathologic diagnostic yields stratified by location were 91 % in the proximal duodenum at esophagogastroduodenoscopy, 88 % in the jejunum at antegrade DBE, 52 % in the ileum at retrograde DBE, and 57 % in the terminal ileum at colonoscopy. VCE and DBE were helpful in determining treatment in 44 % of patients.
