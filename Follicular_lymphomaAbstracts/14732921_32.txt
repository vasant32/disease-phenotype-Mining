Follicular lymphoma (FL) is characterized by the activation of BCL2 through t(14;18)(q32;q21). Additional acquired mutations are necessary to generate a fully malignant clonal proliferation. Many of these secondary genetic alterations are visible in the clonal karyotype; however, the sequence by which they arise and their influence on clinical behavior have not been determined. The ability to address these issues has been hampered by the lack of computational methods to manipulate complex chromosomal data in a sufficiently large cohort of cases. In the present investigation, we analyzed secondary karyotypic alterations in 336 cases of FL with t(14;18) to identify the most common regions of recurrent chromosomal gain or loss. This revealed 29 recurrent changes present in more than 5% of the tumors. Each tumor karyotype was then assessed for the presence or absence of each of these 29 specific changes. By statistical means, we show that the chromosomal changes arise in an apparent temporal order, with distinct early and late changes. We identify, by principal-components analysis, four possible cytogenetic pathways that characterize the early stages of clonal evolution, which converge to a common route at later stages. We show that FLs with t(14;18) may be classified into cytogenetic subgroups determined by the presence or absence of 6q-, +7, or der(18)t(14;18). Correlation with clinical outcomes in a subset of cases with clinical data revealed del(17p) and +12 to be correlated with an adverse clinical outcome. The clinical implications of these pathways of clonal evolution need to be examined on a prospective basis in a large cohort of FLs.
