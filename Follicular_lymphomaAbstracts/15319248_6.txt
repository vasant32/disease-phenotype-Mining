 BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of ISIS 3521, an antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide to protein kinase C alpha in patients with relapsed low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients received ISIS 3521 (2 mg/kg/day) as a continuous infusion over 21 days of each 28-day cycle. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 53 years (range 37-77). Histological subtypes were low-grade follicular lymphoma (n = 22) and B-cell small lymphocytic lymphoma (n = 4). Twenty-one (81%) had stage III/IV disease. The median number of previous lines of chemotherapy was two (range one to six). A total of 87 cycles of ISIS 3521 were administered. Twenty-three patients were assessable for response. Three patients achieved a partial response. No complete responses were observed. Ten patients had stable disease. Grade 3-4 toxicity was as follows: neutropenia (3.8%) and thrombocytopenia (26.9%). CONCLUSIONS: ISIS 3521 has demonstrated anti-tumour activity in patients with relapsed low-grade NHL. There may be a potential role for this agent in combination with conventional chemotherapy for advanced low-grade lymphoma, and further trials are warranted.
