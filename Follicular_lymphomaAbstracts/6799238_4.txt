Lymph node specimens from 125 patients with malignant lymphomas and related disorders were studied by immunoperoxidase procedure for the presence of intracytoplasmic immunoglobulin (CIg) and J chain CIg staining was present in 22/24 cases of lymphoplasmacytic-lymphoplasmacytoid lymphomas, and in 10/10 cases of extramedullary plasmacytomas and myelomas. In the majority of these cases J chain could be demonstrated in plasmacytoid or neoplastic plasma cells. In 21/36 cases of immunoblastic lymphomas, intracytoplasmic Ig staining was present. In only two of the 36 cases were the lymphomatous cells stained positively for J chain. J chain was not detected in other lymphomas such as lymphocytic lymphomas, follicular lymphomas, lymphoblastic lymphomas or in Reed-Sternberg cells or hairy cells. J chain was demonstrated in mature plasma cells and immunoblastic cells in hyperplastic lymph nodes, and in angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy. These findings show that J chain is not detectable in all B cell lymphomas even in the presence of CIg synthesis, irrespective of class.
