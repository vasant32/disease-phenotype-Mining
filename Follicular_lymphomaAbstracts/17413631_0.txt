We describe an unusual case of composite lymphoma (CL) in the orbit. The clinical history and biopsy specimen of an 82-year-old woman with a right orbital mass were evaluated. The orbital biopsy contained a dense lymphocytic infiltration and nodules of large lymphocyte that immunostained positive for CD20. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping showed two distinct populations of cells, confirming the diagnosis of a simultaneous follicular lymphoma (FL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). The patient was treated with CD20 antibody (rituximab) and is in remission at 3 months follow-up.
