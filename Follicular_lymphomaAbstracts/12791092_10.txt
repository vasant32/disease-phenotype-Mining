In the periphery, B cells differentiate in germinal centres (GCs) of secondary lymphoid organs. Isolated GC cells die quickly in vitro by apoptosis. Therefore, cell lines originating from follicular lymphomas, which are the malignant counterparts of GC B cells, would provide a stable in vitro model to study the immunobiology of GC B cells. We have established three novel human follicular lymphoma cell lines that were characterized with special reference to immunophenotypic features, response to B-cell receptor (BCR) triggering, response to cytokines and cytokine mRNA expression. One of the cell lines, HF-1A3, has a phenotype of a centrocyte. It expresses surface immunoglobulin G (sIgG) and dies by apoptosis following BCR cross-linking. Co-stimulation with interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-15 or interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) rescues HF-1A3 cells from BCR-induced apoptosis. The second cell line, HF-28, also represents phenotypically an IgG+ centrocyte. Ligation of its BCR leads to the cell-cycle arrest at G1 instead of apoptosis. HF-28 cells express both CD45RA and RO isoforms, which is unusual in B lymphocytes apart from plasma cells, thus suggesting a transition to plasma cell phenotype. The third cell line, HF-4.9, which phenotypically represents an sIgM+ centroblast, responds by proliferation to BCR cross-linking. These cell lines offer a unique in vitro model to study antigenic selection and cytokine-mediated growth regulation of human GC B cells.
