From an acute B-cell leukemia cell line, a DNA probe was obtained that was specific for chromosome 18 and flanked the heavy chain joining region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome 14. This probe detected rearrangement of the homologous DNA segment in the leukemic cells and in follicular lymphoma cells with the t(14:18) chromosome translocation but not in other neoplastic or normal B or T cells. The probe appears to identify bcl-2, a gene locus on chromosome 18 (band q21) that is unrelated to known oncogenes and may be important in the pathogenesis of B-cell neoplasms with this translocation.
