 OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of various types of malignant lymphoma (ML) in the Al-Qassim region of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) according to recently introduced the WHO classification. METHODS: For this retrospective analysis, material was available in 385 out of 519 cases diagnosed as ML from 1988-2007. Morphological assessment was followed by immunohistochemistry using a panel of antibodies. The study was conducted at Prince Faisal Oncology Centre (PFOC) of King Fahad Specialist Hospital (KFSH), Buraidah, Al-Qassim, KSA. RESULTS: Out of 385 cases reviewed, 251 (65.2%) had non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and 117 (30.4%) had Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Male preponderance (male to female ratio 1.6:1) and a wide age range was observed (6 months to 103 years). B cell neoplasms were the most common NHL seen (81.6%) and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was the most frequent type of NHL encountered (50.1%). Indolent lymphomas like follicular lymphoma (FL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) were rather uncommon (13.2%). T cell lymphoma comprised 18.3% of the NHL. The most common type of HL was nodular sclerosis classical Hodgkin lymphoma (NSCHL) (68.3%). CONCLUSION: In Al-Qassim region of KSA, NHL is the most common ML seen and DLBCL the most common type. Unlike other parts of KSA and Middle East, NSCHL is the most common type of HL encountered.
