This report summarizes the clinical course of 17 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas who were treated with high dose intermittent intravenous cyclophosphamide between 1966 and 1968. Diagnostic biopsies have been reclassified according to the Rappaport classification. Five patients were found to have diffuse lymphomas, none of whom experienced complete remission or prolonged survival. Twelve patients had nodular lymphomas, five of whom achieved complete remission lasting from 22 to 113+ months (mean 59+ months). Two patients survived 78 and 113+ months, respectively, with no sign of recurrence. High dose cyclophosphamide alone may provide long term control of some patients with nodular lymphomas.
