In the present study we used a human follicular lymphoma cell line, HF1A3, as an in vitro model for the antigen-driven selection process in germinal centers. Apoptosis can be induced in HF1A3 cells by B cell receptor (BCR) stimulation, but the molecular mechanisms and kinetics of this process are largely unknown. We demonstrate here that there is over 12 h delay between receptor activation and the execution phase of apoptosis, i.e. disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation. New protein synthesis is required for mitochondrial alterations and subsequent apoptosis to occur, as these processes are completely blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. All the apoptotic events induced by BCR triggering are completely reversed by CD40 ligation with anti-CD40 antibody. CD40 ligation can reverse the apoptotic process in HF1A3 cells almost until the first mitochondrial events take place demonstrating that CD40-mediated protection operates very fast and at or before mitochondrial phase of apoptosis. Using specific inhibitors of cell signaling we could demonstrate that Raf-extracellular signal-regulated kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, p38 or protein kinase C activation pathways are not involved in CD40-mediated protection from BCR-induced apoptosis in HF1A3 cells.
