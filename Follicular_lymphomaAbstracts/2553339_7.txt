We have established a new Epstein-Barr virus transformed cell line from a patient with B-cell follicular lymphoma. Telomeric fusions were observed in several subclones, with the nonrandom involvement of chromosomes 1, 5, 12, and 17. Centromeric staining with immunofluorescent anti-kinetochore antibodies was positive in both centromeres of the fused chromosomes, suggesting they were both active. Unlike previously reported cases, we were unable to demonstrate telomeric fusions directly in cells from the patient's blood. However, the finding of identical immunoglobulin gene rearrangements in DNA from the patient's blood and cell line suggested that they originated from the same malignant B-cell clone.
