We report the case of a 65-year-old man who presented with epigastric pain and guaic-positive stool. Upper and lower endoscopy revealed abnormalities in the gastric antrum and terminal ileum. Biopsy of these sites revealed histologically and immunophenotypically distinct lymphomas: gastric extranodal marginal zone lymphoma in the background of Helicobacter pylori infection and follicular lymphoma of the terminal ileum. After treatment with an H. pylori eradication regimen, repeat endoscopy showed resolution of the gastric extranodal marginal zone lymphoma and persistence of the ileal follicular lymphoma. Interestingly, molecular studies performed on the biopsy specimens revealed a common IgH rearrangement, suggesting a common precursor cell responsible for these two malignant processes. We present this unique case with a review of the literature, highlighting treatment principles for these two subtypes of indolent gastrointestinal non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
