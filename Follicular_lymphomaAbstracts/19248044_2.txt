 BACKGROUND: : Recent experience has suggested that there has been a stepwise improvement in the survival outcomes of patients who have follicular lymphoma with the introduction of new treatment options. In the current study, the authors report the results of 2 subsequent phase 2 trials of 238 previously untreated patients. METHODS: : In a trial of bleomycin, epidoxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (BACOP) plus fludarabine, mitoxantrone, and dexamethasone (FND), 144 patients received 2 BACOP treatments followed by 4 FND treatments. In a trial of BACOP plus fludarabine and rituximab (FR), 94 patients received 3 BACOP treatments followed by 4 FR treatments. RESULTS: : The complete remission (CR) rate for BACOP/FND was 62%. After a median follow-up of 60 months, the failure-free survival (FFS) and overall survival (OS) rates at 4 years were 53% and 77%, respectively. The CR rate for BACOP/FR was 79%. After a median follow-up of 36 months, the FFS and OS rates at 4 years were 56% and 97%, respectively, which were significant compared with the CR and OS rates achieved with BACOP/FND. Twenty-five of 42 bcl-2-positive patients attained a molecularly negative CR and had improved FFS. No significant differences were observed between the 2 trials in the percentage of infections or neutropenia. CONCLUSIONS: : The CR and OS rates achieved with BACOP/FR were better, and overall toxicity did not increase. Furthermore, patients who received rituximab had a better FFS compared with patients who received chemotherapy alone. Finally, although conclusions between nonrandomized groups may depend on differences in observed and unobserved prognostic features, the current results suggested that the addition of rituximab to anthracycline-fludarabine-containing regimens have a favorable effect on the prognosis of patients with advanced follicular lymphoma.
