 OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical characteristics, pathology, diagnosis and treatment of primary pulmonary lymphoma. METHODS: Eighteen cases of primary pulmonary lymphoma diagnosed from Jan 1989 to Feb 2007 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: There were 6 males and 12 females, with a median age of 47.5 years (17-71 years). Fifteen cases were diagnosed by surgical lung biopsy; 1 by percutaneous needle lung biopsy (1/6), 1 by percutaneous needle lung biopsy and bronchoscopic examination at the same time, the other 1 by bronchoscopic examination (1/10). Histological diagnosis showed that 2 cases were Hodgkin lymphoma, 9 mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, 1 follicular lymphoma, 2 diffuse large B cell lymphoma 2 anaplastic large cell lymphoma, 2 non-Hodgkin lymphoma whichcould not be classified because the slides were from other hospitals. The most common symptoms were cough (9/18) and fever (6/18). ESR elevation was common (10/12). CT features included solitary or multiple nodules (14/18), patchy opacities (11/18), consolidations (5/18), pleural effusions (5/18), atelectasis (5/18), and cavities (1/18). Misdiagnosis was found in 11 patients. Treatment modalities included surgical resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Median follow-up time was 11 months (10 d to 205 mon). Thirteen patients were still alive, 4 patients were lost, and 1 patient died. The prognosis was associated with the level of [25.1 x 10(9)/L(18.1 - 39. -1) x 10(9)/L in poor prognosis group, 6.7 x 10(9)/L (5.48 - 8.41) x 10(9)/L in good prognosis group, u = 0.000, P <0.05] leukocytosis (3/3 vs 1/10, P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical manifestations of primary pulmonary lymphoma are nonspecific. Misdiagnosis is common. Surgical lung biopsy is necessary for early diagnosis.
