Immunoglobulin kappa gene usage and somatic mutation patterns were studied in a series of 47 IGKV-J rearrangements amplified in 42 follicular lymphoma (FL) cases. The IGKV1-39/1D-39 gene predominated and was significantly over-represented compared to normal cells, autoreactive cells or other B cell lymphomas. The impact of somatic hypermutation varied significantly; nevertheless, mutation distribution patterns indicated pressure for preservation of the B cell receptor. In conclusion, the present series demonstrates biased usage of IGKV genes in FL and alludes to the important role of immunoglobulin kappa light chains in antigen selection of the clonogenic B cells in FL.
