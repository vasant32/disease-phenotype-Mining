In a recent genome-wide association study of follicular lymphoma (FL), we identified novel risk alleles on chromosome 6p21.33 that appeared to be part of an extended haplotype including HLA-DRB1*0101, DQA1*0101, and DQB1*0501. To follow up on these findings, we obtained 2-4 digit HLA-DQB1 allelotypes on a subset of 265 cases of FL and 757 controls using a novel assay that applies multiplexed ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). We confirmed a positive association between FL and the HLA-DQB1*05 allele group (OR = 1.70, 95% CI 1.28-2.27; adjusted p-value = 0.013) and also identified an allele group inversely associated with FL risk, HLA-DQB1*06 (OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.38-0.69; adjusted p-value = 4.46 × 10(-5)). Although these findings require verification, the role of HLA class II proteins in B-cell survival and proliferation makes this a biologically plausible association.
