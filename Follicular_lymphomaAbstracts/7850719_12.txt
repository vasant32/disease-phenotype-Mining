BACKGROUND: A unique case of primary testicular lymphoma in a child is reported. METHODS: Tumor tissue was studied using immunohistochemical techniques and southern blot hybridization to detect immunoglobulin and bcl-2 gene rearrangement and in situ hybridization for the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome. RESULTS: Light microscopy revealed a lymphocytic infiltrate with a follicular pattern. Immunohistochemical staining revealed lambda light chain restriction and gene rearrangement studies revealed a clonal rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain, confirming a clonal neoplastic process. Immunostaining failed to detect bcl-2 protein expression, and no evidence of bcl-2 gene rearrangement was noted on southern blot analysis. In situ hybridization for EBV nucleic acid in tumor tissue was negative. CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a case of a primary testicular lymphoma with follicular histology in a child. Despite the follicular histology, no evidence of bcl-2 expression or gene rearrangement was detected.
