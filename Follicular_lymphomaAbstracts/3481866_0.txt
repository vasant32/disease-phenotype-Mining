The authors report the case of a 42-year old woman who developed chronic myelocytic leukemia with Philadelphia chromosome followed, 21 months later, by malignant follicular lymphoma with small cleaved cells and giant cells. This case is comparable to the other associations of acute or chronic myelocytic and lymphocytic blood diseases previously published. Several pathogenic theories are reviewed. They involve chemotherapy with alkylating drugs (but the diagnosis is sometimes simultaneous), cellular oncogens or, more probably, a clonal abnormality of the stem cell sequentially or concomitantly expressed in the cells of both lineages; unfortunately, in the absence of Philadelphia chromosome this theory has not yet been demonstrated on lymphoma cells.
