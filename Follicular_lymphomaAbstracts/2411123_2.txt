Fifty cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (15 nodular and 35 diffuse) were studied to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and ease of several different immunoperoxidase methods. The methods included a rapid, simple one-step immunoperoxidase procedure on frozen sections compared with indirect immunoperoxidase technics on paraffin sections. The frozen-section immunoperoxidase technic stained 15 of 15 nodular lymphomas and 24 of 35 diffuse lymphomas for monoclonal light chain. The majority of the diffuse lymphomas that did not stain for light chains were morphologically and immunohistochemically consistent with T-cell lymphomas. The indirect method on B-5 and formalin-fixed tissues only rarely displayed monoclonal staining for nonplasmacytoid small cell lymphomas but did stain some large cell lymphomas and a majority of plasmacytoid lymphomas for monoclonal light chain. The frozen section technic presented in this report is sufficiently sensitive and reliable to detect immunoglobulins in any morphologic subtype of B-cell lymphoma, whereas paraffin-embedded tissues have only limited application.
