Numbers and distribution of HNK-1 (Leu 7) positive cells within 115 malignant Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) were evaluated in situ by immunomorphometry. Results on the infiltration were related to histological and clinical parameters. A mean of 4.099 +/- 350 HNK 1+ cells/microliter tumor tissue was found, which was comparable to normal (reactive) lymphatic tissues (4.441 +/- 1.235) and was about a quarter of the population density of T helper/inducer (TH) and T cytotoxic/suppressor (TS) lymphocytes together. The distribution of HNK 1+ cells within the tumors was diffuse except in nodular lymphomas of follicular center cell origin (centroblastic/centrocytic = cb/cc NHL). When evaluating the different histological subgroups, the highest number of HNK 1+ cells was found within the tumor areas of cb/cc, which contained about three times as many positive cells as the other NHL. High numbers were also found in the diffuse variant of cb/cc but not in centrocytic NHL. Different degrees of HNK 1+ cell densities were observed in lymphocytic lymphomas (4.426 +/- 754), with high numbers in about 30% of the patients. Splenic tissues of 6 hairy cell leukemias displayed lower numbers of HNK 1+ cells as compared with other low grade malignant NHL. In "large cell" NHL, the lymphoblastic subtype showed only sparse HNK 1+ cells (1.345 +/- 386). The number was significantly reduced in comparison to all other NHL (p less than 0.01) and markedly lower than in the other NHL of high malignancy (immunoblastic and centroblastic NHL, p less than 0.02). The diminuation was not due to a simple dilution phenomenon in a rapidly proliferating tumor, as TH and TS infiltrates were comparable to other NHL. Correlating results with the clinical course (available in 58 patients), significantly higher numbers of HNK 1+ cells were found in NHL of low malignancy (p less than 0.02), but patients with a favourable course did not differ from those with progressive disease (p less than 0.5). Patients treated by cytotoxic drugs showed higher numbers of HNK 1+ cells than those before or without treatment (p less than 0.02). Results on TH and TS cell numbers in comparison to HNK 1+ cells showed completely different patterns of infiltration.
