IgM paraproteinemia is considered to be the major defining feature of Waldenstr√∂m's macroglobulinemia (WM), but it may also occur in other B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. In this study we have reviewed the final pathological diagnosis of 106 patients with IgM paraproteinemia investigated in our laboratories between April 1993 and May 1999. In 22 of the 106 patients (20.8%), there was no clinical or laboratory evidence of an underlying lymphoproliferative disorder, and a diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) was therefore made. In 60 cases (56.6%), a diagnosis of WM was made, while in the remaining 24 patients, the final diagnosis was chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 10), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 5), extranodal marginal-zone lymphoma (n = 3), follicular lymphoma (n = 3), and mantle-cell lymphoma (n = 3). The median paraprotein concentration in patients with WM, MGUS, and "other" lymphoproliferative disorders was 13 g/L (range, 2-54), 6 g/L (range, 3-30), and 4.5 g/L (range, 3-61), respectively. It is clear that IgM paraproteins are demonstrable in all subtypes of peripheral B-cell disorders and, although paraprotein concentrations are generally higher in WM, there is considerable overlap. Immunophenotypic criteria are therefore essential for the accurate diagnosis of WM.
