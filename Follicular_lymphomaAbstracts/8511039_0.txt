Some recent aspects of the molecular biology of chromosome abnormalities that activate the BCL2 gene in B cell malignancies (follicular lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia) are discussed. We also report data showing that the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) LMP-1 protein which can induce the expression of BCL2, is found infrequently in follicular lymphomas which exhibit no apparent BCL2 gene rearrangement.
