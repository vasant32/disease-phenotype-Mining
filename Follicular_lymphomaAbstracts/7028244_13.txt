Twelve patients who developed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with a follicular pattern during the first two decades of life were studied. Eight had the poorly differentiated lymphocytic type; the remaining four had the "histiocytic" type. Eleven of the 12 patients were male. Nine were asymptomatic, and eight had lymphadenopathy in the head and neck region. Comparison of ages revealed the extent of disease tended to be localized (Stages I and II) in the pediatric (less than 16 years old) patients (83%) and generalized in the adolescent-young adult (16-19 years old) patients (83%). Of ten patients treated with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, eight achieved complete remissions that lasted 3-58 months (median, 17.5 months). Five are still in remission; three have relapsed. Seven are alive 12-120 months from diagnosis (median, 48 months); six have no clinical evidence of disease. The remaining five patients died two to 164 months after diagnosis (median, 13 months). Three of the four patients who died with lymphoma had diffuse "histiocytic" lymphoma demonstrated at autopsy examination. Poor prognostic factors included 1) failure to achieve a complete remission following initial therapy; 2) extranodal disease (with the exception of the poorly differentiated lymphocytic type involving the spleen and liver); 3) development of diffuse "histiocytic" lymphoma. Follicular lymphoma occurring in the second decade of life has a biologic behavior similar to follicular lymphoma in adults.
