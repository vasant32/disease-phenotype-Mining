The representative endoscopic features of primary intestinal follicular lymphoma are well known as small whitish polypoid nodules, but a magnified view has only been described in a few case reports. Herein, we report a case with intestinal follicular lymphoma in which magnifying endoscopy with narrow band imaging was helpful for prompt diagnosis. A 57-year-old Japanese woman underwent surveillance esophagogastroduodenoscopy. The endoscopic examination revealed confluent whitish granules in the duodenum, distinct from the nodules or polyps that are typical findings of intestinal follicular lymphoma. Magnifying endoscopy visualized whitish enlarged villi, and narrow band imaging emphasized an elongated and coiled vascular pattern. Based on these features, intestinal follicular lymphoma was highly suspected, and subsequent histological study confirmed the diagnosis. This case demonstrates that magnifying endoscopy with narrow band imaging was useful for the detection and prompt diagnosis of intestinal follicular lymphoma. The pathological features of intestinal follicular lymphoma are also discussed.
