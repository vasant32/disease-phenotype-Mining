 PURPOSE: This is a multicenter phase I/II dose-finding study in relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) evaluating veltuzumab, a humanized anti-CD20 antibody with structure-function differences from chimeric rituximab. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-two patients (median age, 64 years; 79% stage III/IV, one to nine prior treatments) received four once-weekly doses of 80 to 750 mg/m(2) of veltuzumab and were assessed for safety, efficacy, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity. RESULTS: Veltuzumab was well tolerated, with no grade 3 to 4 drug-related adverse events despite short infusion times (typically 2 hours initially, 1 hour subsequently at doses < 375 mg/m(2)). In follicular lymphoma, 24 (44%) of 55 patients had objective responses (OR), with 15 (27%) complete responses (CRs) or CRs unconfirmed (CRus) by International Working Group criteria, and with some responses occurring despite two to five prior rituximab-containing regimens, less favorable prognosis (elevated lactate dehydrogenase, tumors > 5 cm, and Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index > or = 2), and at all dose levels. The CRs/CRus were durable (median duration, 19.7 months), with five patients still ongoing (15.9 to 37.6 months duration). In marginal zone lymphoma, five (83%) of six patients had ORs, with two CRs/CRus (33%), and in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, three (43%) of seven patients achieved partial responses. At all dose levels studied, B cells were depleted after the first infusion, veltuzumab serum half-lives were similar after the fourth infusion, and mean antibody serum levels exceeded values considered important for anti-CD20 therapy (ie, 25 microg/mL). CONCLUSION: Veltuzumab appeared safe and active at all tested doses, encouraging further study, including dose levels less than those typically used with rituximab.
