A new, sensitive method combining seminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and heteroduplex analysis was used to detect follicular lymphoma (FL) cells in peripheral blood. Based on the detection of IgH rearrangement in DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes, the method demonstrated the presence of monoclonal B cells in FL patients with high frequency.
