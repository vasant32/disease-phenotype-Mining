 BACKGROUND: Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) has been used in the evaluation of lymphadenopathy for a long time and is highly reliable in the identification of metastatic malignancies. However, the role of FNA in the assessment of new lymphoproliferative disorders continues to be a subject of debate. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the role of molecular cytogenetic studies in FNA diagnoses of lymphoproliferative disorders. METHODS: A retrospective, computer-based search for lymph node FNAs from 2006 to 2007 was performed. Cases with either fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies were subjected to further analysis. RESULTS: In total, 243 lymph node FNAs were performed during the period, including 104 that were positive/suspicious for metastatic malignancies, 16 that were positive/suspicious for lymphomas, 15 that demonstrated atypical lymphoid proliferation, 73 that were reactive, 14 that were deemed granulomas, and 21 that were determined to be nondiagnostic. Molecular analysis included combined FISH/PCR in 4 cases, FISH only in 7 cases, and PCR only in 4 cases. By using multiplex PCR, 6 cases with atypical/negative flow cytometry results were diagnosed as 4 B-cell lymphomas, 1 T-cell lymphoma, and 1 reactive lymph node; and 4 cases that had atypical T cells determined by flow cytometry were diagnosed as reactive. One CD10-negative follicular lymphoma and 2 cases with suspicious flow cytometry results were positive for t(14;18)(q32;q21) by FISH. Forty-five cases had follow-up histology with 3 false-negative findings and no false-positive results. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, multiplex PCR studies for immunoglobulin heavy-chain or T-cell receptor gene rearrangements were useful for demonstrating clonality, and FISH studies were able to detect translocations or gene rearrangements that allowed for the subclassification of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas.
