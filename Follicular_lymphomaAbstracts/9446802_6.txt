Two isoforms encoding the full-length transmembrane death receptor 3 (DR3) were isolated from mRNAs of a panel of human cell lines and tumor tissues obtained from patients with follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. A new DR3 variant (DR3 beta) was characterized by 2 insertions of respectively 20- and 7-base pairs (bp) which result in a predictive translated polypeptide differing from the described DR3 molecule by a 28 amino-acid stretch in the extracellular domain. DR3 was shown to be expressed in all cell lines and lymphoma samples tested, whereas DR3 beta expression was restricted to lymphoid T-cell and immature B-cell lines and to selected cases with follicular lymphoma. These data provide new insight into the molecular heterogeneity of DR3, suggesting the presence of several receptor isoforms that can participate in lymphoid cell homeostasis.
