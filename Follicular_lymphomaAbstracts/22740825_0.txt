 BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) has been proposed as treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS) and other autoimmune diseases. AIMS: To describe the effects of allo-HCT on the course of MS in a 49-year-old woman with longstanding progressive MS who was treated with allo-HCT for follicular lymphoma. METHODS: Non-myeloablative conditioning allo-HCT, examination for IgG oligoclonal bands and measurement of CXCL13 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). RESULTS: Despite the disappearance of oligoclonal bands in CSF, disease progression and CSF inflammation was observed. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that CXCL13 and MMP-9 detected in CSF may reflect ongoing, pathogenic immune activation even after the eradication of intrathecal IgG synthesis. This suggests that progressive MS may depend more on innate than on adaptive immune activation.
