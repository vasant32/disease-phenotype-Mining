Based on Bcl-X(L) overexpression studies we identified type I and type II follicular lymphoma cell lines in response to TRAIL. We demonstrate here that either amount of caspase-8 activation or Bid cleavage could not define the dependence on mitochondria. Furthermore, an inhibitor of NF-kappaB, PDTC, enabled TRAIL to activate type I apoptotic pathway in type II cells. However, an inhibitor of IKK did not switch apoptosis to type I pathway in type II cells, indicating that NF-kappaB might not be responsible for the switch.
