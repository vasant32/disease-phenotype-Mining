Abstract CD25 expression in follicular lymphoma (FL) has not yet been investigated. Eighty-five patients with newly diagnosed FL were retrospectively evaluated. On two-color flow cytometric analysis, CD25 was detected on CD19+ and CD20+ lymphoma cells. CD25 expression in FL tended to be higher than in reactive lymphadenopathy, but was lower than in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Patients with CD25+ FL (n=12) showed clinical features of elevated soluble IL-2R levels, B symptoms, and an advanced age compared with CD25- FL (n=73). The overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) in patients with CD25+ FL were significantly inferior to those with CD25- FL (ORR, 60 vs. 93%; 2-year PFS, 32 vs. 80.3%; 6-year OS, 47.4 vs. 85.9%, respectively). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that CD25-positivity is an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS in FL. CD25+ FL may constitute a distinct subgroup associated with aggressiveness and an inferior prognosis.
