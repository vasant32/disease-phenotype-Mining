Histological preparations from 22 irradiated patients with gigantofollicular lymphoblastoma Brill-Symmers have been reviewed and graded in  accordance with the Kiel classification 1974. Corresponding to this, 19 patients had centroblastic-centrocytic lymphoma and three a centroblastic sarcoma. In the three sub-groups of centroblastic-centrocylic lymphomas, no essential differences were found in stages I-III with respect to anamnesis or clinical findings before the onset of treatment, or to the previous course of the disease. Centroblastic sarcoma, ranging among the lymphomas with a high degree of malignancy, has manifested unfavorable progressive courses in all patients.
