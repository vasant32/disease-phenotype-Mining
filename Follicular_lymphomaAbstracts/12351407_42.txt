Reduced levels of p27(Kip1) are frequent in human cancers and have been associated with poor prognosis. Skp2, a component of the Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex, has been implicated in p27(Kip1) degradation. Increased Skp2 levels are seen in some solid tumors and are associated with reduced p27(Kip1). We examined the expression of these proteins using single and double immunolabeling in a large series of lymphomas to determine if alterations in their relative levels are associated with changes in cell proliferation and lymphoma subgroups. We studied the expression of Skp2 in low-grade and aggressive B-cell lymphomas (n = 86) and compared them with p27(Kip1) and the proliferation index (PI). Fifteen hematopoietic cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes were studied by Western blot analysis. In reactive tonsils, Skp2 expression was limited to proliferating germinal center and interfollicular cells. Skp2 expression in small lymphocytic lymphomas (SLLs) and follicular lymphomas (FCLs) was low (mean percentage of positive tumor cells, less than 20%) and was inversely correlated (r = -0.67; P <.0001) with p27(Kip1) and positively correlated with the PI (r = 0.82; P <.005). By contrast, whereas most mantle cell lymphomas (MCLs) demonstrated low expression of p27(Kip1) and Skp2, a subset (n = 6) expressed high Skp2 (exceeding 20%) with a high PI (exceeding 50%). Skp2 expression was highest in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) (mean, 22%) and correlated with Ki-67 (r = 0.55; P <.005) but not with p27(Kip1). Cytoplasmic Skp2 was seen in a subset of aggressive lymphomas. Our data provide evidence for p27(Kip1) degradative function of Skp2 in low-grade lymphomas. The absence of this relationship in aggressive lymphomas suggests that other factors contribute to deregulation of p27(Kip1) expression in these tumors.
