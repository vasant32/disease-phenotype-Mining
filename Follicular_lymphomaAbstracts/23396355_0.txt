Primary mesenteric lymphoma is a disease of the mesenteric lymph nodes that may represent a localized process or a component of a more disseminated pattern of disease.The case refers to a woman of 78 years, that was studied by ultrasound examination after accidental finding of abdominal mass. The examination confirmed the presence of the lesion; it defined the place (peritoneum) and the features (neoplastic lesion). Computer tomography (CT) confirmed the ultrasound diagnosis and showed an additional smaller lesion. The cytology exam from the CT biopsy showed to be a follicular lymphoma B. This case confirms the ultrasound examination role in the study of peritoneal lesions and underlines how a proper diagnostic process is essential for therapy.
