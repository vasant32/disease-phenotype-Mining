A phase II study of Prednimustine (PMN) was conducted for follicular lymphoma (FL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). PMN at a dose of 40-60 mg/body, p.o. every day, was administered to 17 patients with FL and 4 with CLL. The dose and schedule of PMN was modified according to hematological toxicity. Among the 17 patients with FL, there were 6 (35.3%) CRs and 7 (41.2%) PRs, with a high response rate of 76.5%. Among the 4 patients with CLL, there were 2 PRs and one case which showed clinical improvement. PMN was effective for cases of FL and CLL refractory to alkylating agents, and therefore the result suggested a lack of clinical cross-resistance to these agents. As to the side effects observed in patients with FL, mild leukopenia (median of lowest count 3,150/mm3) occurred. One case experienced anorexia, while increased appetite was observed in 4 cases. We conclude that PMN is effective for FL and CLL, and that in addition, it has an advantage in that its mild side effects allow long-term administration through outpatient clinics, so that the quality of life for patients is not impaired.
