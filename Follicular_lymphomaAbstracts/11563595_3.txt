Patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) usually present with advanced disease, with lymph nodes and bone marrow involvement. Extranodal infiltration is infrequent. In FL isolated cutaneous relapse is a very rare event that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously reported. We report on a 55-year-old woman with FL who presented with an isolated skin relapse 5 years after the diagnosis. The patient, who had relapsed after three lines of chemotherapy, was treated with the chimeric anti-CD20 antibody, rituximab, achieving a complete response, which has now persisted for more than 24 months.
