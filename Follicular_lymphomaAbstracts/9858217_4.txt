Within the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) family the induction of apoptosis is restricted to some ligand-receptors pairs, including TNF-TNF receptor type I (TNFRI/p55), FasL-Fas, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and its death-receptors (DR)-4 and -5. The pair CD40L-CD40 belongs to the same family but rescues B cells from apoptosis. To investigate how these opposing actions are cross-linked, purified follicular lymphoma (FL) cells were activated upon a human CD40L-transfected murine fibroblastic layer, then RNA messengers for the above molecules were analysed using RT-PCR. The observed down-modulation of TRAIL and up-regulation of TNF and Fas transcripts might account for CD40-CD40L-mediated FL cell survival.
