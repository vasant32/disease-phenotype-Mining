This study defined the clinical features and assessed the prognosis of 47 patients (17 males, 30 females, median age 63 years) with primary nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. Forty-five per cent had stage IV disease. Hepatitis C virus serology was positive in 24%. According to the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI), 33% were classified as low-risk, 34% as intermediate-risk, and 33% as high-risk. The 5-year overall survival (OS) was 69%. In univariate analysis worse OS was associated with: FLIPI (P = 0.02), age > 60 years (P = 0.05) and raised lactate dehydrogenase (P = 0.05). In multivariate analysis, only FLIPI predicted a worse OS (P = 0.02).
