An analysis is presented of the histopathologic, clinical and prognostic features of malignant lymphomas (MLs) treated at the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital Medical Center, Manila, between 1975 and 1981. There were 434 malignant lymphomas, constituting 3.86% of all cancers studied at this institute during this period. Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas accounted for 82%. Among these, nodular lymphomas constituted 8% of the group and diffuse lymphomas 92%. In diffuse lymphomas, poorly differentiated lymphocytic lymphomas (31%) and histiocytic lymphomas (30%) were predominant. Pleomorphic lymphomas, which are frequently observed in southwestern Japan and are now known to be a peculiar type of adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia, were not found in this group. Hodgkin's disease constituted 18% of all the malignant lymphomas, among which there were 52% mixed cellular type and 21% lymphocytic depletion type. These data were correlated with those of other countries.
