Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has been used to demonstrate the t(14;18) in up to 100% of follicular lymphoma (FL) cases, however, there is little reproducible data using fixed tissue. The aim was therefore to develop a robust FISH method for the demonstration of translocations in archival tissue. The technique was evaluated by comparison with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), capable of detecting the majority of known breakpoints. Twenty-eight paired frozen and fixed cases of FL and 20 reactive controls were analyzed. The t(14;18) was detected in 23 of 28 cases using PCR on frozen material and 8 of 20 in paraffin. Using FISH, 24 of 26 frozen and 26 of 28 paraffin cases had a demonstrable translocation. All 20 reactive nodes were negative for the t(14;18) by PCR. Using FISH, one of the reactive cases had occasional cells with a translocation FISH pattern, demonstrable in frozen and paraffin samples. This is consistent with the presence of the t(14;18), which is well described in normal individuals. Both PCR and FISH are highly effective for t(14;18) analysis in unfixed tissue. When only paraffin blocks are available, FISH is the method of choice, and a result was achieved in 100% of cases. The method is applicable to the retrospective analysis of a range of translocations.
