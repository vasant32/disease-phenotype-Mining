 INTRODUCTION: To date, little is known about blood immune marker changes that may be related to the development of Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) and treatment response with few serum biomarkers that could be useful in follow- up of the patients. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the expression of suppressor of cytokine signalling-3-(SOCS-3) gene at the mRNA level in the peripheral blood of patients with NHL and correlate with clinical pathological features and response to treatment. METHODS: Thirty patients with NHL and 20 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. The SOCS-3 mRNA level in peripheral blood (PB) was detected by semi-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Quantification of cytokines such as interleukin 6 and tumour necrosis factor alpha (IL-6 & TNF-Î±) were performed using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). RESULTS: Increased expression of SOCS-3 mRNA in peripheral blood plus increased serum levels of IL-6 and TNF alpha from NHL cases with no complete remission after therapy. Higher levels of expression of SOCS-3 are associated with advanced disease, bone marrow involvement, extranodal involvement, poor performance status, B cell symptoms (fever, night sweats and weight loss) and high serum lactate dehydrogenase level which are evaluated by international prognostic index (IPI). Complete responses occur in 60% of patients with normal expression of SOCS-3 gene. Increased expression of SOCS-3 is common in diffuse large B cell lymphoma, CLL/small lymphocytic B cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: Over-expression of SOCS-3 mRNA from peripheral blood of NHL patients correlates with advanced disease and poor response to treatment. SOCS-3 mRNA expression in peripheral blood from NHL patients might be used to monitor response during treatment.
