We used a standardized electrophoresis protocol to identify differentially expressed proteins based on a sample pooling approach comparing three follicular lymphoma and three mantle cell lymphoma-derived cell lines. One hundred and seventy-five consistently differentially expressed proteins were identified out of more than 1600 protein spots per gel. Of these 175 protein spots, 38 of the 41 most highly expressed proteins were identified by MS analysis (MALDI-TOF), involving different cellular programs such as DNA repair (Rad50), cell cycle control (Mad1L1), transcription (SAFB), and apoptosis (Luca-15 protein). Expression data were confirmed by Western blot analysis of identified proteins and 2-D gel hybridization of proteins with known overexpression (G1/S-specific cyclin-D1, apoptosis regulator Bcl-2). Comparison of proteome analysis to RNA expression array data revealed only a modest correlation of RNA and protein level emphasizing the relevance of post-translational regulation in lymphomagenesis (p = 0.36). Most interestingly, additional data bank search identified 13 out of 17 referenced proteins (76%) as members of a TP53-dependent network of cell regulation.
