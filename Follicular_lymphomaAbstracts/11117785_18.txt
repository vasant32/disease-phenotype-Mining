It has been considered that gastric large B cell lymphoma mainly consists of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALToma) with large cell transformation. However, debate continues about the cell lineage. We analyzed 61 operated cases of gastric B cell lymphoma, mainly focusing on 40 cases of diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL). Immunohistologically, two cases were classified as CD10-positive follicular lymphoma, 19 cases were low-grade MALToma, 11 CD10-negative DLCL with a component of low-grade MALToma (high-grade MALToma), 12 CD10-positive DLCL, and 17 CD10-negative DLCL without MALToma (pure DLCL). Lymphoepithelial lesion (LEL) was found in all -cases of high-grade MALToma, and in eight of these its invasion was confined to the mucosa and submucosa. Expression of Bcl-6 was detected in two cases of high-grade MALToma. Only two cases of CD10-positive DLCL had large cell LEL, and seven cases showed tumor invasion beyond the submucosa. All 12 cases were positive for Bcl-6, and a delicate meshwork of CD35 (Ber-MAC-DRC)-positive follicular dendritic cells was detected in eight cases. Pure DLCL of all 17 cases reached the proper muscle layer or more, and expression of Bcl-6 was detected in 10 cases. For patients with pure DLCL, overall survival was significantly (p <0.05) worse than those of high-grade MALToma and CD10-positive DLCL by Kaplan-Meier and log-rank methods. Clinical staging and Bcl-6 expression were also good prognostic factors in patients with DLCL. Three groups of gastric DLCL each had unique histologic findings, immunohistologic characteristics, and prognosis.
