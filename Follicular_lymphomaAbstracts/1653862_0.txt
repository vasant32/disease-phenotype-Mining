The results of DNA or RNA study in EBV-associated lymphoproliferative diseases were shown. For detecting EBV DNA, Southern blot analysis with Bam HIW probe (Internal Repeat) and non-repeat (least often deleted) probe are used. Probes close to (ex. LMP) or within terminal repeat can indicate clonality in terms of junctional structure. Several such examples were shown, in which benign polyclonal EBV (+) CD3 + 8+ lymphocytes, EBV (+) CD3 + 4 - 8- granulay lymphocytosis, EBV (+) t(14, 22) B-cell lymphoma and EBV (-) follicular lymphoma with reactivation type serology were included. The detectability of EBV DNA was tested in consecutively sampled acute IM peripheral cells by Southern blot analysis with Bam HIW, PCR with Bam HIK (EBNA1) and its Southern re-estimation. The results indicated that EBV DNA was detectable rarely in the earliest samples, and that PCR can increase the sensitivity, as expected. The gene expression of IL-2R alpha (-) IL-2R beta (+) and perforin (-) by IM cells were assessed with Northern blot analysis. The abundant gamma IFN gene expression by IM cells was revealed by reversed PCR.
