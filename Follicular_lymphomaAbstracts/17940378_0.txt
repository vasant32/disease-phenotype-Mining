Standard salvage chemotherapy for refractory or relapsed malignant lymphoma has not been defined. The efficacy and feasibility of the ACES regimen, consisting of carboplatin at 100 mg/m(2) on day 1 to 4, etoposide at 80 mg/m(2) on day 1 to 4, high-dose Ara-C at 2 g/m(2) on day 5 and methylprednisolone at 500 mg/day for 5 days, for refractory or relapsed lymphoma were retrospectively reviewed in comparison with the ESHAP regimen. The subjects were 29 patients, including 7 aggressive follicular lymphomas, 16 large B cell lymphomas and 6 Hodgkin lymphomas. Characteristics of patients with ESHAP (19 cases) and the ACES (10 cases) group were as follows: male/female ratio, 10/9 and 3/7; median age, 49 (range, 31-72) and 54 (22-65); and initial clinical stage (I and II / III / IV), 5/8/6 and 1/1/8, respectively. Among the 29 patients, complete response was achieved in 68% (13/19) in ESHAP and 40% (4/10) in ACES.Progression-free survival and overall survival were 31.3% and 34.3%, respectively. Hematological toxicity was not significantly different between the two groups, and renal toxicity was significantly higher in ESHAP (52%) than ACES (0%). We concluded that the ACES regimen had a possibility of effective consolidation therapy for the elderly aiming to undergo autologous stem cell transplantation.
