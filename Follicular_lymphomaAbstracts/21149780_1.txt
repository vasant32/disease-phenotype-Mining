 OBJECTIVES: To evaluate efficacy, patient tolerance, and adverse effects of CyberKnife radiosurgery for the treatment of intraocular and periocular lymphoma. METHODS: Retrospective case series of 13 patients who underwent CyberKnife radiosurgery was conducted. RESULTS: Fourteen eyes of 13 patients were included. The tissue location of the lymphoma was orbit (7 eyes), conjunctiva (3 eyes), choroid (2 eyes), and retina (2 eyes). The lymphoma type was classified as extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma in 7 eyes (50%), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in 3 eyes (21%), follicular lymphoma in 2 eyes (14%), and benign reactive lymphoid hyperplasia in 2 eyes (14%). The mean treatment dose was 1718 centigrays (cGy) (range, 1350-2250 cGy) given over a mean of 5 days (range, 3-5 days) with a mean dose rate of 320 cGy per fraction. Complete tumor resolution without local recurrence over a mean follow-up of 23 months was documented in all cases. Radiation-associated adverse effects included mild dry eye in 2 patients and cataract in 1 patient with conjunctival lymphoma. There was no radiation retinopathy or papillopathy, and visual acuity was preserved or improved in 13 eyes and decreased in 1 eye due to the presence of cataract. CONCLUSIONS: CyberKnife radiosurgery is a well-tolerated technique for the treatment of intraocular and periocular lymphoma, allowing for local resolution of the lesions. An important benefit is that treatment was completed over 5 days.
