Lenalidomide-rituximab therapy is effective in grade 1-2 follicular and mantle cell lymphoma, but its efficacy in diffuse large cell (DLBCL), transformed (TL), and grade 3 follicular lymphoma (FLG3) is unknown. In this phase II trial, 45 patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL (n=32), TL (n=9), or FLG3 (n=4) who had received 1-4 prior lines of treatment were given 20â€‰mg oral lenalidomide on days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle and intravenous rituximab (375 mg/m(2)) weekly during cycle 1. . Grade 3/4 hematological toxicities included neutropenia (53%), lymphopenia (40%), thrombocytopenia (33%), leukopenia (27%), and anemia (18%), with a median follow-up time of 29.1 months (range, 14.7-52.0 months). OR rate was 33%; median response duration was 10.2 months. Median PFS and OS were 3.7 and 10.7 months. Nine of 15 responding patients (3 PR, 6 CR) proceeded with stem cell transplantation (SCT) and were censored at the time of transplant. When data were analyzed without censoring, median PFS remained 3.7 months and response duration increased to 30.9 months. Rituximab plus oral lenalidomide is well-tolerated and effective for patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL and TL. SCT after lenalidomide-rituximab is associated with prolonged response duration.
