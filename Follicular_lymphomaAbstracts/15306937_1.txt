Among malignant lymphoproliferative disorders, an association with lymph node infarction appeared most frequently in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), followed by that in follicular lymphoma (FL). However, little is known about antigen preservation in the infarcted lymphoid tissue. FLs eventually transformed to diffuse lymphomas, comprising a significant proportion of DLBCLs. To examine the antigen preservation of the follicular center cell markers in the infarcted lymphoma, we studied 7 DLBCLs and 4 FLs diagnosed concurrently with or following lymph node infarction. Sections of viable and infarcted tissue were immunostained in parallel by using a panel of antibodies effective in routinely processed, wax-embedded tissue. The panel included L26 (CD20), 56C6 (CD10), 124 (BCL-2), and polyclonal BCL-6 antibody. The present study indicated that CD20 (91%) and CD10 (80%) antigen appear to be well preserved even in infarcted lymphoma tissues and provide useful information regarding the infarcted material. However, BCL-2 (40%) and BCL-6 (0%) antigens were of little or no value in the infarcted lymphoid tissues.
