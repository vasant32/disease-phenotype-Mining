Primary thyroid lymphoma is a rare disease. Most of the patients have a history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Main histopathologic subtypes are either mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) or diffuse large cell lymphomas. Treatment options are surgical resection in localised, low-grade MALT lymphomas or systemic chemotherapy in aggressive, diffuse large cell lymphomas. But, sometimes other histopathologic subtypes can be seen and therapeutic approaches must be done. We report two patients who have primary thyroid lymphoma. There was no history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis in either case, and neither of them had MALT histologic subtype. First patient a sixty four year old woman, admitted to hospital because of bilateral thyroid nodules. Histological subtype was B cell follicular lymphoma. Subtotal thyroidectomy was performed and radiotherapy was administered to the entire neck region. Second patient, a 50 year old man, presented with complaints of a left thyroid mass and dyspnoea. Total thyroidectomy was carried out and chemotherapy was given. Histological diagnosis was diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Thyroid lymphomas had heterogenous histological and clinical characteristics. In localised, non-aggressive subtypes, surgical treatment must be considered. Postoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy may be necessary in some patients.
