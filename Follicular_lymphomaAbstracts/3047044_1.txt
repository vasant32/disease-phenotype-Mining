Most follicular lymphomas can be readily diagnosed on morphological grounds by finding closely packed pale-staining follicles partitioned by scanty dark-staining interfollicular tissue. We describe two cases of an unusual 'reverse' variant of follicular lymphoma in which the nodules have dark-staining centres and pale-staining cuffs due to concentration of centroblasts at the periphery of the neoplastic follicles. Recognition of this unusual pattern of follicular lymphoma is important, to avoid confusion with progressive transformation of germinal centres or nodular lymphocyte predominance Hodgkin's disease.
