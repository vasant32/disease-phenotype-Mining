We have examined in a population-based observational study the survival of young patients (less than 40 years) with follicular lymphoma (FL) treated conventionally and followed for up to 17 years (minimum 10, median 13 years). Data were derived from the Scotland and Newcastle Lymphoma Group (SNLG) database from 1986. Histology of all available cases was reviewed to ensure that patients met the modern criteria for diagnosis of FL. Of 55 patients identified from the database, 46 were confirmed to have follicular lymphoma. There were 25 males and 21 females, median age 34 years (range 16-39). Thirty-four patients presented with advanced stage disease (Stages III and IV). The majority of patients received initial treatment with chemotherapy, though 7 had surgery (biopsy or splenectomy) alone and 7 radiotherapy alone. All 12 patients with early stage disease showed a complete response (CR) with initial therapy; 6 relapsed and 2 have died (1 of transformation to high grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma). Overall survival of patients presenting with stage IIIA disease was 68% at 10 years, and 69% for patients in stages IIIB and IV. The SNLG prognostic index for low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was predictive for overall survival. The 71% overall survival in this patient cohort at 10 years provides a baseline for comparison with the results of a more aggressive approach to treatment.
