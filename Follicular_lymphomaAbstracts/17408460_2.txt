Stage I/IIA follicular lymphoma (FL) is considered a localised disease that can be adequately treated with radiotherapy alone. Bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) involvement in FL was investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a series of 24 consecutive patients with histologically revised diagnosis and treated with involved field radiotherapy. Despite the limited stage, Bcl-2/IgH+ cells were found at diagnosis in PB and/or BM of 16 patients (66.6%). After treatment, in 9/15 Bcl-2/IgH positive evaluable patients, a disappearance of Bcl-2/IgH+ cells was observed, which persisted after a median follow-up of 43.5 months (range 11-70) in all but one patient. Quantitative PCR demonstrated the feasibility of clearing PB and BM Bcl-2+ cells after local irradiation of the primary site of the disease only when the basal number of lymphoma cells was <1:100 000. Patients with Bcl-2/IgH+ cells at diagnosis or after treatment had a higher likelihood of relapse. Thus, despite a negative BM biopsy, the majority of localised FL Bcl-2/IgH+ cells were found in the PB and BM. Lymphoma cells can reversibly spread from the affected lymph node to PB and BM and, in a proportion of cases, durably disappear after irradiation. The possibility of a persistent lymphoma cell clearance is proportional to the amount of cells detected at presentation by quantitative PCR.
