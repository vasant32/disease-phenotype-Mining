Our laboratory has recently discovered a novel candidate oncogene, MCT-1, amplified in human T-cell lymphoma and mapped to chromosome Xq22-24. This region is amplified in a subset of primary B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), suggesting that increased copy number of a gene(s) located in this region confers a growth advantage to some primary human lymphomas. We examined a diverse panel of lymphoid malignancies for the expression of MCT-1. We demonstrated that there are significantly increased levels of MCT-1 protein in a panel of T-cell lymphoid cell lines and in non-Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines. Furthermore, we identified a subset of primary diffuse large B-cell lymphomas that exhibited elevated levels of MCT-1 protein. Interestingly, all transformed follicular lymphomas in our study demonstrated elevated protein levels of MCT-1. There was no detectable MCT-1 protein in leukemic cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or in any healthy lymphoid tissue examined. Lymphoid cell lines overexpressing MCT-1 exhibited increased growth rates and displayed increased protection against apoptosis induced by serum starvation when compared with matched controls. We found that MCT-1-overexpressing cells show constitutively higher levels of phosphorylated PKB/Akt protein, especially under serum starvation. Activation of survival pathways may be an additional function of the MCT-1 gene. Our data suggest that high levels of MCT-1 protein may be associated with a high-risk subset of lymphoid neoplasms and may further support the potential role of MCT-1 in promoting human lymphoid tumor development.
