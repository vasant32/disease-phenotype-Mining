The t(14;18), which juxtaposes the immunoglobulin enhancer region from chromosome 14 to the bcl-2 gene on chromosome 18, is a recurrent cytogenetic abnormality in the majority of follicular lymphomas (FL). This translocation results in overexpression of bcl-2, which increases cellular life span of the mutated cells by decreasing apoptosis. The t(14;18) also occurs in a subgroup of diffuse large cell lymphomas (DLCL), and current thought is that the majority of these represent transformation of FL. Low grade FL are characterized by low proliferation, and diploid/peridiploid DNA content. In this study, we compared proliferative activity (PF) and DNA content (DI) in FL containing the t(14;18) to DLCL with and without the t(14;18). The mean PF and DI were lower in the NHL containing t(14;18) irregardless of histologic subtype. We conclude that increased life span due to the presence of t(14;18) provides the conditions for accumulation of a different set of mutations as compared to those NHL developing from mutations in more rapidly proliferating precursors. This has implications for prognosis of patients with DLCL depending upon the presence or absence of t(14;18).
