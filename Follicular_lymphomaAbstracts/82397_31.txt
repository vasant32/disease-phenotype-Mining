Ninety diffuse large-cell lymphomas (diffuse histiocytic lymphoma) were subclassified into B-cell, T-cell, and histiocytic types according to their enzyme histochemical and immunohistochemical characteristics. The B-cell type was characterized by presence of intracellular monoclonal immunoglobulin; negative or weakly positive diffuse acid phosphatase activity; and an occasional focal nodular pattern or preceding nodular lymphoma. The T-cell type was characterized by moderate, focal acid phosphatase activity; convoluted nuclear structure; and frequent preceding cutaneous manifestations. The histiocytic type was characterized by strong nonspecific esterases and diffuse acid phosphatase activity and presence of lysozyme and phagocytic activity. Most of the lesions (74 cases) were of the B-cell type. This group was further subdivided into follicular center cell type and B-cell immunoblastic sarcoma, according to the stage of cellular transformation. Preliminary clinical correlation suggests that the histiocytic type is most resistant to treatment. B-cell immunoblastic sarcomas were much more aggressive than neoplasms of the follicular center cell type.
