Differential expression of CD20 surface antigen in B-cell neoplasms at different sites is largely unknown. The number of CD20 antibodies bound per cell (CD20 ABC) in bone marrow (BM), peripheral blood (PB), and lymph node aspirate (LNA) samples from patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) or other B-cell disease was studied using quantitative flow cytometry. CD20 ABC differed significantly with the specimen type in B-CLL, being highest in PB (mean, 9,051) and lower in BM (mean, 4,067) and LNA (mean, 3,951). No difference in CD20 ABC between BM and PB samples was found in splenic lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, or follicular lymphoma. Also, we found a significant difference of CD20 ABC by type of disease: lowest in B-CLL; higher in splenic, follicular, and mantle cell lymphoma; and highest in hairy cell leukemia. The lower CD20 surface antigen levels in BM and LNA than in PB in B-CLL may have clinical relevance with regard to the efficacy of rituximab therapy.
