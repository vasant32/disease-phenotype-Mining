One of the serious complications of Paget's disease (PD) is a significant increase in the risk of developing osteosarcoma. Approximately 1% of the patients with PD develop osteosarcoma. This contributes significantly to the mortality and morbidity of the patients with PD. We present the case of an elderly person, who developed osteosarcoma 1 year after being diagnosed to have PD. The patient had been diagnosed to have lymphoma 8 years prior to the diagnosis of PD. The association between PD and follicular lymphoma is discussed.
