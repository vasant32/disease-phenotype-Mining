A set of stable mouse-human hybrids was constructed from the neoplastic lymphocytes from a patient with nodular lymphoma and from another with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Both patients had shown a clinical response to human leucocyte interferon. The same interferon preparation inhibited the growth rate of 14 out of 17 established hybrid cell lines. This system provides evidence of a direct growth inhibitory effect of interferon on neoplastic B lymphocytes. Such a system could be used to predict the sensitivity of a patient's tumour before therapy.
