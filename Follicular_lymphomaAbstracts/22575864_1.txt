Molecular testing for mutations activating the mitogen-associated protein kinase signaling pathway is being used to help diagnose thyroid carcinomas. However, the prevalence of these mutations in thyroid lymphomas has not been reported. Therefore, we studied the prevalence of BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, and KRAS mutations in 33 thyroid lymphomas and correlated the mutational status with the clinical, pathological, cytogenetic, and immunophenotypic findings. Eleven cases were also tested for PAX8/PPARγ translocations. The lymphomas included 25 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, 6 extranodal marginal-zone lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type, and 2 follicular lymphomas. Seventeen diffuse large B-cell lymphomas were germinal center type, six non-germinal center type, and two unclassifiable (Hans algorithm). None of the cases had an associated thyroid carcinoma. Mutations of the BRAF gene were identified in six (24%) diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (D594G in three germinal center diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, K601N in two germinal center diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, and V600E in one non-germinal center diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) and of the NRAS gene in two (8%) non-germinal center diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (Q61K and Q61H). BRAF and NRAS mutations were not found in any extranodal marginal-zone lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type or follicular lymphomas. HRAS and KRAS mutations were not identified in any of the cases, nor were PAX8/PPARγ translocations found. Thus, interpretation of finding a BRAF or NRAS mutation in the thyroid, particularly in preoperative thyroid aspirates, must take into account the differential diagnosis of a lymphoma. In addition to the diagnostic importance, our data also demonstrate that alteration in the mitogen-associated protein kinase pathway may have a role in the pathogenesis of some large B-cell lymphomas of the thyroid with potential therapeutic implications.
