The stomach is a common site of extranodal malignant lymphoma. Here we examined the clinicopathological features of 317 gastric B-cell lymphomas and characterized the differences among low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas (LG), high-grade MALT lymphomas (HG), follicular lymphomas (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DL). Cases included 126 DL, 71 HG, 98 LG, 10 FL, three Burkitt's lymphoma and nine of undefined type. The age range of patients was as follows: LG, 14-96 years (mean, 61.1); HG, 20-87 years (mean, 63.9); DL, 16-88 years (mean, 62.8); and FL, 54-76 years (mean, 65.5). There were no differences in age with respect to tumor type. There were more women patients with LG (female:male, 55:43), while males predominated among DL patients (54:72). The sexes were represented almost equally in HG cases (34:37). Histological findings, especially in DL tumors, correlated significantly to the gross appearance of mass formation. Dutcher bodies were encountered mainly in HG or LG cases. Our results showed no differences in age, sex or site of disease between LG, HG and DL tumors. However, the grade of malignancy correlated strongly to gross appearance. Dutcher bodies were important for the diagnosis of gastric MALT lymphoma.
