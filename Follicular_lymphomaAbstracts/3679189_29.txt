The Ki-67 antibody, a monoclonal antibody that reacts with nuclei in actively proliferating cells, was used in an immunohistochemical study to assess the growth fractions of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and related disorders. The lowest proliferative indices were found in small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia and intermediate lymphocytic/mantle zone lymphoma. An intermediate proliferative index was seen in the follicular lymphomas and diffuse small cleaved cell and diffuse mixed cell lymphomas. A high index was seen in the diffuse large cell lymphoma and lymphoblastic lymphoma. The highest and most consistent proliferative index was seen in small noncleaved cell lymphoma. Cases of reactive follicular hyperplasia had a significantly higher proliferative index than those of follicular lymphoma. We conclude that the Ki-67 antibody has great utility in providing an estimate of the proliferative rate of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Prospective studies may show this information to have prognostic value independent of histologic classification.
