Two new monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), UCL3D3 and UCL4D12 were obtained following immunization with follicular lymphoma (UCL3D3) or low-grade primary B cell gastric lymphoma cells (UCL4D12). In normal splenic white pulp, tonsil and small intestinal Peyer's patches, UCL4D12 recognizes marginal zone B cells and a subpopulation of follicle centre cells, whereas mantle zone B cells are UCL4D12 negative. In contrast, UCL3D3 recognizes mantle zone B cells and follicular dendritic cells, but not marginal zone B cells or follicle centre B cells. Double-immunofluorescence studies showed that in the splenic white pulp, these antibodies stain reciprocally. The majority of UCL3D3+ cells are sIgM+ and sIgD+ whereas a higher proportion of UCL4D12+ cells express surface IgM (sIgM) but not surface IgD (sIgD). Less than 10% of splenic B cells express both 3D3 and 4D12 antigens. None of the cell lines tested expressed either antigen. Functional studies showed that both antigens play a role in B cell activation as the MoAbs increase the mitogenic effect of Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I on tonsil B cells. This effect was maximal at 72 h in culture. TPA activation was reduced, and no effect was observed with anti-immunoglobulin (anti mu) or CDw40 (G28.5). UCL3D3 and UCL4D12 did not show any stimulatory effect on their own. Biochemical studies show that both MoAbs recognize proteins of 80-90 kD under reducing conditions. These two MoAbs appear to recognize new B cell surface antigens which may be useful for identifying subpopulations of B cells.
