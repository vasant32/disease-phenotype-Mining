In follicular lymphoma, somatic hypermutation of the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes facilitates the identification of different lymphoma cell clones, and the construction of genealogical trees. To analyze the dissemination of lymphoma cells, and the role of the bone marrow for disease progression, we simultaneously analyzed the somatic hypermutation patterns of lymph node and bone marrow specimens of three patients at onset and relapse. Immunoglobulin heavy chain genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, cloned and sequenced. Mutational pedigrees were constructed in a hierarchical order. Where direct transition of one mutation pattern into that of successor clones was not feasible, hypothetical predecessor clones were created, and a probability measurement calculation was introduced. Eighty-five sequenced clones were generated. The average mutation rates were 13,45% for the lymph nodes, and 9,78% for the bone marrows. Forty-two hypothetical predecessor clones were introduced into inter-compartment pedigrees. The genealogical trees showed early lymphoma clones with a low mutational load quickly migrate from the lymph node into the bone marrow. Bi-directional lymphoma cell migration was detectable between the two compartments. In one follicular lymphoma, a clone identical to the initial lymph node clone was detected two years later in the bone marrow. The newly introduced algorithm allows the evaluation of both time and direction of follicular lymphoma cell migrations. We found evidence that follicular lymphoma originates in the lymph node, and infiltrates the bone marrow early in the disease course. Moreover, inter-compartment migration between lymph nodes and bone marrow occurs in both directions.
