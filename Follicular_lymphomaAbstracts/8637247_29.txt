Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is both hepatotropic and lymphotropic and a clear-cut association has been proposed between HCV infection and mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC), a benign lymphoproliferative disorder, which sometimes evolves into a frank malignant B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL). Moreover, in the presence of antibodies to HCV, as well as of HCV-specific genomes has been reported in the sera of over 37% patients with B-NHL, not associated with MC. Thus, we decided to perform both a serologic and a molecular study to give insights into a possible relationship between HCV infection and neoplastic lymphoproliferations. We used ELISA and RIBA tests to show that anti-HCV antibodies were present in the serum of 29 out of 69 unselected B-NHL patients (42%), while seropositivity in a healthy population was about 1%. The prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies was low in definite subsets of B lymphoid disorders, including multiple myeloma, Waldenstr√∂m's macroglobulinemia and monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance. Then, using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, we detected HCV sequences directly in the pathologic lymph node biopsies in 13 out of 34 B-NHL cases, and in particular in six out of eight low-grade lymphomas of MALT type and in five out of eight centroblastic-centrocytic follicular lymphomas. In contrast, the peripheral blood samples from 10 B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients resulted negative for the presence of HCV genomes. Similarly, viral sequences were absent in 10 T cell NHL, while only one out of the 14 Hodgkin's disease cases tested resulted positive. Finally, we used a PCR-based assay to characterize the genotypes (I-IV) present in the positive lymphomatous tissues. The presence of both serologic and molecular markers of HCV infection in a high percentage of certain types of B-NHL, not associated with cryoglobulinemia, and its absence from other lymphoproliferative diseases extends the spectrum of HCV-associated lymphoproliferations arguing in favor of some role of this viral infection in the pathogenesis of the malignant proliferation of definite B lymphoid populations.
