BCL-2 is a membrane protein known to be an apoptosis inhibitor. It is the product of the bcl-2 gene located on chromosome 18. Several different tumors show BCL-2 over-expression as result of a translocation or independently from it. More than 85% of follicular lymphomas and a smaller number of diffuse large cell B lymphomas contain t(14;18) (q32;q21). The aim of this study was to investigate the immunohistochemical expression of the BCL-2 protein and to ascertain, by means of traditional PCR (Polimerase Chain Reaction), its possible dependence from t(14;18) (q32;q21) in 9 primary central nervous system lymphomas. Six cases (67%) shoved immunohistochemical BCL-2 over-expression and 3 cases (33%) had t(14;18). Precisely: 2 cases (22%) had immunohistochemical BCL-2 over-expression and t(14;18) (q32;q21); 4 cases (44%) had BCL-2 over-expression without translocation; 1 case (11%) did not show diffuse BCL-2 over-expression in presence of the traslocation; the remaining 2 cases (22%) did not demonstrate BCL-2 over-expression or t(14;18) (q32;q21). In conclusion, our results indicate primary central nervous system lymphomas frequently show BCL-2 over-expression that in some case may be related to t(14;18) (q32;q21). Nevertheless, t(14;18) (q32;q21), as evaluated by traditional PCR, may not correspond to diffuse immunohistochemical BCL-2 positivity.
