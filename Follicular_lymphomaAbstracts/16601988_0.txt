Atypical presentation of Churg-Strauss syndrome includes lymph-node and parenchymatous organ involvement which mimics the clinical presentation of lymphoproliferative disorders.A 54-year old man with a history of a low-grade follicular lymphoma presented with rapidly growing abdominal lymph-nodes and hepatic, renal and pulmonary infiltrations. CT guided biopsies to verify either lymphoma or infections showed eosinophilic, necrotizing, granulomatous vasculitis leading to the diagnosis of atypical Churg-Strauss syndrome. Within a few days of cyclophosphamide and prednisone treatment the clinical presentation improved and imaging studies detected regression of all manifestations during follow-up.
