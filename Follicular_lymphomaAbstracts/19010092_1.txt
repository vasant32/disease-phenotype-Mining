Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the uniquely expressed B-cell CD20 receptor. Although recently approved for treatment of follicular lymphomas, the intracellular events that occur when rituximab binds to CD20 are largely unknown. Quantitative proteomic analysis of B-cell lymphoma-derived cells exposed to rituximab was performed. Differentially expressed proteins belonged to functional groups involved in migration, adhesion, calcium-induced signaling, ubiquitination, and components of the phosphoinositol and NF-kappaB pathways. Our studies reveal the proteomic consequences of rituximab treatment and provide novel insights into the mechanism of action of the drug in susceptible B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.
