Abstract The aim of this study was to report the clinical and pathological characteristics, treatment strategies and outcome in patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) primarily involving the hard palate. Nine consecutive patients with indolent NHL of the hard palate were identified. The palate was a site of initial disease for six patients (four stage IAE and two stage IIIAE) and of relapse for three. There were four cases of grade 1-2 follicular lymphoma (FL), two of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and three of marginal zone lymphoma (MZL). All nine patients received involved site radiation therapy (RT) alone. There was no grade â‰¥ 3 toxicity. At a median follow-up of 55 months, 5-year freedom from local progression was 100%, disease-free survival was 38% and overall survival was 80%. In conclusion, involved site RT is well tolerated and provides excellent local control in the management of indolent lymphoma of the hard palate.
