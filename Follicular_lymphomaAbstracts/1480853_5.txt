The final Workshop of the meeting focused on cases of Hodgkin's disease (HD) in combination with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), either T, B, or anaplastic large cell (ALC) type. The cases selected for this session fell into five categories: nodular lymphocyte-predominance Hodgkin's disease (NLPHD) with NHL, B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with HD-like transformation, follicular lymphoma (FL) with HD or anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) (composite or discordant), HD following mycosis fungoides (MF), and HD following ALCL. Taken together, these cases left the participants with the distinct impression that there is likely to be some biological relationship between HD and a variety of T cell and B cell NHL.
