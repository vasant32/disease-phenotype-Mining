Apolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against a polymorphic epitope on HLA DRbeta that demonstrated evidence for therapeutic activity in follicular lymphoma patients. In pre-clinical studies, we previously reported that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment significantly enhanced lymphoma cell killing by HLA class II antibodies, including apolizumab. These results suggested a combination trial of apolizumab and G-CSF (filgrastim). In this trial, we treated six patients with relapsed or refractory 1D10-positive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with filgrastim and variable doses of apolizumab ranging from 0.15 to 1.5 mg/m2. The combination was clinically well tolerated, with only two patients experiencing grade III/IV hematological toxicity (thrombocytopenia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia). Another patient developed a pruritic skin rash, which was probably a treatment-related grade II skin toxicity. Interestingly, two patients with follicular lymphoma who received intensified apolizumab treatment on a three times weekly schedule experienced prolonged stabilization of their disease for 12 and more than 36 months. In conclusion, this small pilot study suggests that a combination of HLA class II antibodies and G-CSF is clinically feasible.
