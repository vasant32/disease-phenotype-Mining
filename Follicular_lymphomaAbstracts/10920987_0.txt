OBJECTIVE: To develop a sensitive method to detect minimal residual disease and to elucidate the significance of bcl-2 gene rearrangement in diagnosis and therapy of malignant lymphoma. METHODS: Using polymerase chain reaction(PCR) to detect bcl-2 gene rearrangement and using serial dilution method to define the sensitivity of PCR. RESULTS: In 9 different malignant lymphoma cell lines, Su-DHL-4 and Su-DHL-6 were shown bcl-2(MBR)/JH rearrangement, the sensitivity of PCR was 1:10(5). In 16 patients with follicular lymphoma, the peripheral blood and bone marrow were PCR positive in 4 both at initial diagnosis and after complete remission. CONCLUSION: Detection of bcl-2 gene rearrangement by PCR provides a sensitive and specific assay of minimal residual disease. It helps improve staging of disease, stratification and evaluation of treatment.
