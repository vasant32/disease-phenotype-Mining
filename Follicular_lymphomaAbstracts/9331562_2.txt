In a case of follicular center cell lymphoma (FCCL) without evidence of histologic progression towards a high-grade lymphoma, t(9;22)(q34;q11) was found simultaneously with a t(14;18)(q32;q21) and a t(8;14)(q24;q32). Molecular studies of this case showed BCL2 and MYC rearrangements in addition to the rearrangements of immunoglobulin heavy (IGH) and lambda (IGL) loci. Investigation of the t(9;22) using Southern blot and RT-PCR analysis failed to detect M-bcr or m-bcr rearrangements of BCR. Two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with ABL and BCR probes revealed presence of a "fusion" signal, but its atypical localization [der(9)] and gene order [cen-ABL-BCR-tel] indicated that this translocation differed from the t(9;22) in chronic myeloid leukemia and did not involve either ABL or BCR. In addition, further FISH analysis using 9q34- and 22q11-specific probes localized the breakpoint on chromosome 9 distal to the NOTCH1 gene and the breakpoint on 22q11 in the IGL gene cluster. These results indicate an IGL-mediated rearrangement of an unknown gene at 9q34 that together with BCL2 and MYC might be involved in the lymphomagenesis of the present case of FCCL and perhaps in other cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in which t(9;22) is sporadically occurring.
