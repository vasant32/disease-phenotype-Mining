The authors examined the number and distribution of cells reacting with monoclonal antibodies to T-cell subsets in frozen tissue sections of B-cell lymphomas (30 follicular and 17 diffuse lymphomas). In five diffuse lymphomas (two lymphocytic, three small cleaved cell) the neoplastic B-lymphocytes reacted with the monoclonal antibody anti-T1. In all other cases, the monoclonal antibodies to T-cell subsets reacted only with small lymphocytes concentrated between the follicles of follicular lymphomas and distributed randomly in diffuse lymphomas. The distribution of T cells and the T4+/T8+ ratio in follicular small cleaved and mixed lymphomas was similar, although not identical, to that seen in hyperplastic lymphoid follicles. Fewer T cells and a decrease in the T4+/T8+ ratio were seen in follicular large cell lymphoma and in diffuse large cell lymphomas. The number and distribution of T cells in follicular lymphomas is consistent with the hypothesis that there is a functional interaction between neoplastic B cells and benign T cells. No tumors were found in which the neoplastic B cells reacted with anti-T3, anti-T4, or anti-T8.
