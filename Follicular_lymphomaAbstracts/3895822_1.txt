HNK-1, a murine monoclonal antibody, is known to react with most of the natural killer (NK) and killer (K) cells in peripheral blood. Cells reacting with this antibody (HNK-1+ cells) were studied on tissue sections of ninety two cases of malignant lymphomas (MLs) by using immunoperoxidase technique, in an attempt to elucidate the role of this type of cells in MLs. Follicular lymphomas were found to be highly infiltrated with HNK-1+ cells. The mode of infiltration in follicular lymphomas is just like in normal germinal centers. Many cases of diffuse lymphomas with cleaved nuclei, indicative of diffuse B-cell lymphomas of follicular center cell origin, as well as diffuse ML with heavy fibrosis (sclerosis) or histiocytic reaction, were also found to be infiltrated with abundant HNK-1+ cells. Meanwhile, other types of B-cell ML and all types of T-cell ML, as well as Hodgkin's disease, were shown to be very poor in HNK-1+ cell reaction. From a prognostic viewpoint, the low grade malignancy group in the NCI Working Formulation or Kiel Classification was found to be infiltrated with significantly much more HNK-1+ cells as compared to the high grade malignancy group. The significance of these findings are discussed, with the stress on the possible suppressive function of HNK-1+ cells on proliferation and differentiation of follicular center cell type B-cell MLs.
