Although follicular lymphoma (FL) is generally responsive to conventional-dose chemotherapy, improved survival in patients with this disease has been difficult to demonstrate. High-dose chemo/radiotherapy followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) can improve response rates, although its effects on survival remain controversial. Between 1990 and 2003, we transplanted 49 patients with low-grade FL at our institution. Twenty-two patients (45%) had undergone histologic transformation at the time of ASCT. In all, 44 patients (90%) had relapsed disease and five patients (10%) were resistant to chemotherapy at the time of transplantation. After ASCT, 30 patients (61%) were in complete remission (CR). The median overall survival (OS) has not been reached, while the median event-free survival (EFS) is 2.4 years. At a median follow-up of 5.5 years (longest 12.4 years), a plateau has been reached with 56% of patients remaining alive, and 35% event-free. ASCT was well tolerated except for two (4%) treatment-related deaths. In multivariable analysis, CR after ASCT and age less than 60 years are the best predictors of EFS and OS. ASCT is thus a safe therapeutic approach in FL, resulting in long-term EFS and OS for some patients, even with transformed disease.
