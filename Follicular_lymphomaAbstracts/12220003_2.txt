 PURPOSE: Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes are well-known sequelae of some malignancies. To our knowledge, a syndrome mimicking progressive external ophthalmoplegia had never been reported preceding the diagnosis of a lymphoma. CASE REPORT: A 63-year-old man developed progressive external ophthalmoplegia, without any other neurological symptoms, as the initial manifestation of a follicular lymphoma grade III. The ophthalmoplegia resolved after two cycles of combination chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The ophthalmologist, when confronted with a progressive external ophthalmoplegia, should consider a neurological paraneoplastic syndrome associated with a tumor as a possible diagnosis.
