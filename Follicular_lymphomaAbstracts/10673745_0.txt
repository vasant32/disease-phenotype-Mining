We have investigated the possible role of anti-tumor antibody detected in a case of follicular lymphoma which demonstrated the spontaneous reduction of leukemic tumor cells. The tumor cells genotypically had monoclonal rearrangements of the immunoglobulin J H and C kappa genes, but phenotypically exhibited surface IgG, A, kappa and lambda (kappa lambda dual positivity). The culture study revealed that IgGlambda, at least, was derived from the serum, and IgAkappa was expressed intrinsically. Furthermore, the positive correlation between the densities of both surface light chains on two-color flow cytometry, the rosette formation study and its inhibition test by the Fcgamma fragment suggested that the serum IgGlambda combined with some antigens on the tumor-cell surface via its Fab portion and with the Fcgamma receptor of macrophages via its Fc portion. From these findings, we regarded the present case as an anti-tumor antibody-coated lymphoma. In addition, the phagocytic study disclosed that the serum-derived IgGlambda, at least, might have induced the phagocytosis of circulating lymphoma cells by macrophages. In conclusion, the existence of the anti-tumor antibody-coated lymphoma may be helpful in clarifying the immunological mechanism of the spontaneous regression occasionally seen in lymphomas.
