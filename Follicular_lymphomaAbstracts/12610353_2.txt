We have recently shown that MUC1, mapped to the chromosomal band 1q21, is rearranged or amplified in 15% of B-cell lymphomas and that rearrangement led to over-expression of MUC-1 mucin in a case of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). To determine the incidence of MUC-1 mucin expression and its clinical significance in B-cell lymphomas, we investigated a panel of 113 cases by immunohistochemistry (IHC). MUC-1 mucin expression was detected in the majority of cases (92.9%), with moderate to high levels noted in 50.4% of all histologic subsets comprising DLBCL (82 cases), follicular lymphoma (FL) (15 cases), FL with transformation to DLBCL (4 cases), and other B-cell lymphomas (12 cases). No statistically significant correlation was found between MUC-1 mucin expression and MUC1 genomic status (amplification/rearrangement) evaluated by Southern blot analysis, and 1q21 abnormality by karyotypic analysis. For all cases, MUC-1 mucin expression correlated with a previous history of lymphoma (p=0.003).
