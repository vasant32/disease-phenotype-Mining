We describe a patient with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) associated with BCL6 gene rearrangement. MCL is a distinct subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma characterized by CD5+, CD10-, CD20+, t(11;14)(q13;q32) and PRAD1/cyclin D1 overexpression. Although rearrangement of the BCL6 gene is the most frequent genetic change among diffuse lymphomas and some follicular lymphomas this is the first report of a patient with MCL associated with BCL6 rearrangement.
