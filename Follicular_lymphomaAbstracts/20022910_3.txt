 BACKGROUND: Information on the clinical behavior of the recently proposed primary duodenal follicular lymphoma (DFL) is limited. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Demographic data, signs, symptoms, disease stage, and treatment of the patients diagnosed in National Cancer Center Hospital from 1999 to 2007 were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were studied. Nineteen patients were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Twenty patients had stage I disease. The histological grade was 1 or 2 in 26 patients. IgH/BCL2 fusion was shown in 20 of the examined 24 cases (83%). Fourteen patients received therapy upon diagnosis (local radiotherapy in 2 patients and chemotherapy in 12 including rituximab therapy), their response rate was 85%, and the estimated progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 3 years was 70%. One patient developed histological transformation. The other 13 patients were followed up; their estimated PFS rate at 3 years was 74%. Five among six cases responded to treatment even after progressive disease. All 27 patients have survived with a median follow-up time of 47.9 months. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of primary DFL patients have a localized tumor of low-grade histology and are positive for t(14;18). Watchful waiting might be an alternative approach for its indolent course; however, further studies are warranted.
