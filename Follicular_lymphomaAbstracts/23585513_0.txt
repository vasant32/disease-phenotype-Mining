BackgroundThe role of [(18)F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) in follicular lymphoma (FL) staging is not yet determined.Patients and methodsThe aim of the present study was to investigate the role of PET in the initial staging of FL patients enrolled in the FOLL05-phase-III trial that compared first-line regimens (R-CVP, R-CHOP and R-FM). Patients should have undergone conventional staging and have available PET baseline to be included.ResultsA total of 142 patients were analysed. PET identified a higher number of nodal areas in 32% (46 of 142) of patients and more extranodal (EN) sites than computed tomography (CT) scan. Also, the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) score increased in 18% (26 of 142) and decreased in 6% (9 of 142) of patients. Overall, the impact of PET on modifying the stage was highest in patients with limited stage. Actually, 62% (15 of 24) of cases with limited disease were upstaged with PET.ConclusionsThe inclusion of PET among staging procedures makes the evaluation of patients with FL more accurate and has the potential to modify therapy decision and prognosis in a moderate proportion of patients. Further prospective clinical trials on FL should incorporate PET at different moments, and the therapeutic criteria to start therapy should be re-visited in the views of this new tool.
