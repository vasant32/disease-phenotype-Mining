To clarify whether p53 mutation could be involved in the pathogenesis of various subtypes of lymphoma, we investigated 62 Japanese cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) for p53 gene mutations and their relationship with the expression of p53 protein. Mutations in exons 5-9 of the p53 gene were screened for using the non-isotopic RNase cleavage assay (NIRCA) and confirmed by direct sequencing, followed by immunohistochemical analysis for p53 protein. Missense and/or nonsense mutations of p53 were detected in 3 (10.7%) of 28 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBLs) and 2 (15.4%) of 13 T-cell NHLs (15.4%). A single missense mutation at codon 157 (Val to Phe) in exon 5 and at codon 273 (Arg to Pro) in exon 8 was found respectively in 2 DLBLs and in one peripheral T-cell lymphoma (unspecified). In these 3 cases harbouring a missense mutation, overexpression of p53 protein was observed in more than 80% of tumour cells. Double transversion mutations comprising of a missense mutation at codon 167 (Gln to His) in exon 5 and a nonsense mutation at codon 183 (Ser to stop codon) in exon 5 were detected in one DLBL that had apparently transformed from follicular lymphoma and in one advanced adult T-cell lymphoma (ATL). In these two cases harbouring p53 nonsense mutation, no cells positive for p53 protein immunostaining were detected, as well as lymphomas without p53 mutation.
