Patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma are at an increased risk of developing second malignancies. Most commonly, these second primary malignancies are squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region, but also noted are esophageal cancer or lung cancer. Hematologic malignancies are uncommon second malignancies. Diagnosis can be challenging, particularly when a patient suffers metastases of squamous cell carcinoma to the cervical lymph nodes in addition to synchronous or metachronous malignant lymphoma that originates in the cervical lymph nodes. This article describes a case of primary follicular lymphoma in the cervical region that was discovered during a postoperative follow-up after partial glossectomy and neck dissection for tongue cancer.
