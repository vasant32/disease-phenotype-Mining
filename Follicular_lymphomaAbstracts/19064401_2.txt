We present the case of a 35-year-old woman with follicular lymphoma who developed an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced B-cell lymphoproliferation with secondary viral-induced hemophagocytosis 13 months after treatment with rituximab and CHOP (cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone) chemotherapy. The EBV-induced lymphoproliferation was successfully treated with single-agent rituximab. To our knowledge, this is the first such case reported in the literature. Herein, we briefly review the spectrum of immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs), discuss the immune deficit induced by rituximab, and speculate on its possible association with EBV reactivation in this patient.
