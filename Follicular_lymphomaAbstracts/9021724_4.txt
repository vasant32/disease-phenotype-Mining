Intravascular lymphomatosis (IVL) is an extremely rare variant of aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma characterized by confinement of neoplastic lymphocytes within vascular spaces. Although IVL is potentially curable with combination chemotherapy, diagnosis is often delayed, in part owing to the negative bone marrow biopsy specimens that are typical of this disorder. We hypothesized that use of a more sensitive method of analysis might identify small clonal B-cell populations in histologically negative bone marrow biopsy specimens from patients with IVL. With use of a recently described assay for immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement based on the polymerase chain reaction, we demonstrated clonal B-cell populations in histologically negative marrow specimens from five (100%) of five patients with IVL. None of these specimens demonstrated molecular evidence of the t(14;18) associated with follicular lymphoma, providing no evidence for a common derivation of IVL and follicular lymphoma. In summary, molecular analysis of routine bone marrow biopsy sepcimens from patients in whom the diagnosis of IVL is entertained may facilitate prompt recognition of a lympho-proliferative disorder and thereby permit timely therapeutic intervention. Moreover, these findings suggest that despite histologically negative staging bone marrow biopsy specimens, IVL typically disseminates early in its course, thus arguing against the use of localized therapy in this disorder.
