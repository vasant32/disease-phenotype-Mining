Bcl10 is a cancer gene recently identified in B-cell lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues. It has been suggested as a target for mutation in multiple types of tumour including follicular lymphoma, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and Sezary syndrome. To evaluate further the role of Bcl10 in human adult haematological cancers, we screened for mutations samples from 24 patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and 18 samples from patients with T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL). No pathogenic mutations were detected in any of the samples analysed, strongly suggesting that Bcl10 is not involved in the development of CLL or T-PLL and that its involvement may be restricted to other haematological malignancies.
