INTRODUCTION: Allogeneic transplantation of bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cells is a frequently discussed therapeutic option in the treatment of malignant lymphoma. By analysing the results of our own transplant program in patients with advanced lymphoma we tried to evaluate indications for allogeneic transplantations. METHODS: Data from lymphoma patients treated at the Klinikum Grosshadern between 1985 and 2001 were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: 56 patients were included. 24 patients had low grade Non-Hogdkin's lymphoma (NHL) (follicular lymphoma: n = 8, mantle cell lymphoma: n = 6) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL: n = 10), 16 patients had high grade NHL (immunoblastic/lymphoblastic: n = 5; large cell/diffuse: n = 5) and 8 patients suffered from Hodgkins's disease. Median age was 41 years, 34 patients were transplanted from an HLA-identical sibling, 19 from an HLA-id. unrelated donor and three from an HLA-mismatched related donor. 30 patients received bone marrow and 26 peripheral blood stem cells. 22 pat. were treated with an intensive 12 Gy TBI containing conditioning regimen, whereas 34 patients were treated with a dose-intensity reduced conditioning procedere. 25 patients are alive between 2 month and 15 years after transplantation. Overall survival after 2 years is 48 % for patients with low grade NHL (incl. CLL), 9.3 % for patients with high grade lymphoma and 25 % for patients with Hodgkin's disease. 1-year-transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 33.9 % in all patients. Dose-intensity-reduced conditioning was not able to reduce TRM. CONCLUSIONS: Allogeneic bone marrow or stem cell transplantation is able to induce long lasting complete remissions in patients with heavily pretreated malignant lymphoma. Results of allogeneic transplantation are encouraging in patients with follicular and other low grade lymphoma. However transplant-related toxicity is high. At present the impact of reducing the intensity of conditioning is not yet clear.
