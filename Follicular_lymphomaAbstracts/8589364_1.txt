A 41-year-old woman with follicular lymphoma developed sporadic respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia shortly after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-matched sibling. RSV pneumonia is potentially fatal in immunosuppressed patients, but she improved along with the recovery of bone marrow function without specific treatment. Early recovery of myelosuppression supported by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor may have helped to control RSV pneumonia.
