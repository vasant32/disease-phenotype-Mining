Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) comprise a heterogeneous collection of lymphoproliferative malignancies. Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most common NHL sub-type. Over the last years, the introduction of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab has radically changed treatment of FL. After several large prospective randomized trials demonstrated prolongation of remission, current European indications for rituximab include the first-line treatment of patients with stage III-IV FL in combination with polychemotherapy such as CVP or CHOP. This paper discusses the treatment of primary nodal FL with secondary cutaneous involvement with rituximab as monotherapy without additional chemotherapy.
