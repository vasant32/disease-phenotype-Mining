Fifty-two cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were studied with enzyme histochemical methods. Forty-four cases of these were also investigated for surface markers with immunological techniques, and results of histochemical, routine histological and immunological observations were correlated. Twenty-one of 27 B-cell lymphomas showed prominent ATPase activity, while all 13 T-cell lymphomas, except one case, did not show such activity. Nodular lymphomas, though of B-cell nature, were often negative for ATPase and it remained negative after diffuse evolution in some. Four of 7 A1Pase positive lymphomas were of B-cell origin. Dot-like localized AcPase and beta-glucuronidase activity characterized T-cell lymphomas while 5 T-cell PDL, including lymphoblastic type with double markers, showed localized esterase activity. Enzyme histochemical characteristics of lymphomas were fairly honest reflection of those of various functional units in the normal lymph nodes. Enzyme histochemical methods appeared to be a useful tool for the study of lymphomas.
