A case of adenomatosis coli complicated with malignant lymphoma of the spleen is described herein. An increase in the serum lactic dehydrogenase level of a 50 year old female was noted 9 years after she underwent a total colorectal resection for adenomatosis coli complicated by cancer. A tumor was observed in the spleen on CT and ultrasonography, and a diagnosis of malignant lymphoma was subsequently made by biopsy. At the time of splenectomy, no extension of the tumor was observed in any other organs and it was found histologically to be large cell type follicular lymphoma. A review of the 903 patients with adenomatosis coli documented in Japan revealed the occurrence of mesodermal malignant tumors to be considerably high. Hence, adenomatosis coli appears likely to be a causative factor in malignant lymphoma of mesodermal origin.
