Cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies on a t(14;18)-positive follicular lymphoma presenting a remarkable pattern of secondary chromosomal changes are reported. Chromosome analysis of a lymph node biopsy performed at diagnosis revealed the presence of four related subclones characterized by the (14;18) translocation alone or together with one of the following anomalies: add(1)(p36), add(13)(q34), or der(12)(12;13)(q24;q14)add(13)(q34). The chromosome 9 origin of the extra material on the abnormal chromosomes 1 and 13 was demonstrated by FISH and points to "jumping" translocation in the present case.
