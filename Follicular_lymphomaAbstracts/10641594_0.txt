A subset of dendritic cells called germinal center dendritic cells (GCDC) has recently been described inside germinal center from reactive lymphoid organs. We investigated this newly recognized population in follicular lymphoma (FL), which is considered to be the pathologic counterpart of germinal center B cells. Immunohistochemistry analysis with a panel of antibodies demonstrated the presence of a cell population with the peculiar GCDC phenotype in FL biopsies and a similar localization of these cells inside tumoral and reactive follicles. Therefore, we analyzed the relationships between GCDC and the other cell subsets of the tumor follicles. Some of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes present inside the follicle were found to be in close association with GCDC, suggesting a potential implication of GCDC in their activation. In addition, the distribution of GCDC inside FL and reactive follicles did not appear disrupted, in contrast to follicular dendritic cells, the other follicle dendritic cell type. Finally, we demonstrated that GCDC could be detected from FL lymph node cell suspension by flow cytometry. Taken together, these results indicate that FL development is not associated with a disappearance of GCDC or with a lack of physical interactions between GCDC and T cells inside the follicles. In addition, the fact that GCDC can be observed in FL samples by flow cytometry should allow their purification to further study their putative role in FL development and maintenance.
