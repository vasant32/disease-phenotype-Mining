Changes in surface area of lymph nodes visualised on abdominal radiographs following lymphography were measured in 18 patients treated by systemic irradiation for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Eleven radiologically normal nodes in testicular tumour patients receiving higher doses of external irradiation were measured for comparison. Following lymphography spontaneous shrinkage by up to 20% of the surface area of the node was observed. Since spontaneous and continual regression of abdominal nodes can occur exceptionally in nodular lymphoma, treatment was deferred until there was evidence of an increase in the size of nodes judged as being involved by lymphoma. Two forms of systemic therapeutic irradiation were employed, total body (TBI) and hemi-body (HBI). The rate of nodal regression with both was comparable but the amount of regression, time to nadir of node size and subsequent growth delay, was greater for HBI than TBI.
