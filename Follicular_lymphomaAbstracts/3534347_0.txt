Bestrabucil, a chlorambucil-estradiol conjugate known to accumulate in malignant cells irrespective of the presence or absence of estrogen receptor, was administered to a 41-year-old man with follicular lymphoma, medium-sized cell type (LSG classification) stage IV (leukemic). A daily dose of 100 mg was given for two weeks and then 200 mg for a week. The WBC dropped from 43,100/mm3 with 82% abnormal lymphocytes to 12,800/mm3, and the drug was discontinued. It was resumed two weeks later at a daily dose of 50 mg. Four weeks thereafter, complete remission was obtained with the disappearance of all peripheral adenopathies and abnormal cells from the bone marrow. The patient remains disease-free for more than eight months on a maintenance dose of 50 mg per day. Transient erythema and gynecomastia have been the only side effects so far observed.
