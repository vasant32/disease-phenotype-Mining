The classification of lymphoreticular tissue tumours is still confused. The tumours themselves take many forms and tissue reaction may be such as to preclude a clear distinction between neoplastic and inflammatory processes. This has led to what Willis called a chaos of definitions. The grouping proposed by Gall and Mallory in 1942 is still valid and includes Hodgkin's disease, lymphosarcoma, reticulum cell sarcoma, and follicular lymphoma. Its basis is both clinical and histological, particularly the latter; vary slight differences between the respective histological pictures and the possibility of transition forms. True leukaemias, however, must be excluded.
