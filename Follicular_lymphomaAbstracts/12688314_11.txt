The Comprehensive Cancer Centre West (CCCW) population based non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) registry contains information on all newly diagnosed NHL patients living in the region covered by the CCCW. Patients were entered from June 1st 1981 to December 31st 1989. Follow-up is still ongoing, median follow-up is 113 months (1-191 months) for patients alive. In this study, patient and tumor characteristics, data on patterns of care, response and (relative) survival are described. As follicular lymphomas and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas are the most frequently occurring NHL subtypes in the database, a separate analysis is performed to characterize the clinical picture of these disease entities in the CCCW population. Our data illustrate that NHL patients in the general population are substantially older than patients included in trials and hospital based series. Due to older age, treatment is withheld or adapted for a substantial number of patients. The resulting survival and relative survival rates are a reflection of these choices.
