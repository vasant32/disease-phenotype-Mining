A young male patient progressed rapidly from localized abdominal lymph node enlargement to overt acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Despite aggressive treatment, he died of progressive CNS leukemia 5 months after initial presentation. At diagnosis, karyotypic analysis of an abdominal lymph node revealed the coexistence of t(14;18) (q32;q21), specific for follicular lymphoma, and t(8;22) (q24;q11), a variant Burkitt translocation. Such cases might be considered as a model for a general mechanism of tumor progression with cascade-like involvement of oncogenes.
