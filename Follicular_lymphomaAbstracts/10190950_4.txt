BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The use of intensive therapy supported by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is being investigated as treatment for poor-prognosis follicular lymphomas (FL). A single-center experience is herein reported. DESIGN AND METHODS: From September 1990 to October 1997, 30 consecutive patients (pts) with advanced FL received transplants, 8 of bone marrow and 22 of peripheral blood. Thirteen harvests were purged by an immunomagnetic method using anti-B antibodies. Twenty-seven patients received salvage chemotherapy (CT) before ASCT with the objective of reaching this procedure in the best possible response. The disease status at ASCT was: 1(st) CR in 7 pts, > or =2(nd) CR in 6 pts, PR in 10 pts, untreated relapse in 2 pts and chemoresistant disease in 5 pts. RESULTS: There was only one transplant-related death (one month after ASTC). With a median follow-up of 19 (1-89) months, 27 pts are alive, 8 pts have relapsed/progressed at a median time of 11 (6-22) months after ASCT. The estimated 2-year PFS and OS are 57% (95% CI, 34-81%) and 83% (95% CI, 64-100%). When comparing the progression-free interval (PFI) before salvage CT and ASCT and the PFI after ASCT, of 17 evaluable pts, 10 had a PFI after ASCT longer than the previous interval, and 5 additional pts remain in CR/PR with a follow-up that has not yet reached the duration of pre-transplant response. By contrast, 2 pts had a short post-transplant response. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: High-dose therapy followed by ASCT obtains a high rate of responses, frequently longer than any previous PFI. Additional follow-up is necessary to determine whether there is any "plateau" in response duration and to define what proportion of pts may be cured with ASCT in this setting.
