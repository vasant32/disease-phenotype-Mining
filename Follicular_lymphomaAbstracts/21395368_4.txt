Antibody (rituximab) dependent cellular cytotoxicity is a key mechanism in killing CD20+ lymphoma cells. FcγRIIIA-158 V/F gene polymorphism results in expression of 3 variants of the FcγRIIIA receptor (FcγRIIIA) on cytotoxic lymphocytes with different receptor affinity. We studied 102 patients with newly diagnosed FL to assess whether the FcγRIIIA genotype influences outcome in patients treated with risk-adapted immunochemotherapy. The median age was 52 years (31-84); 90% of the patients had advanced (III/IV) clinical stages. The Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) scores were as follows: low 18.9%, intermediate 33.7% and high 47.4%. The front-line treatment was stratified according to the commonly used risk factors (FLIPI, beta-2-microglobuline and serum-Tyrosine-Kinase levels, bulky disease) into 3 treatment groups: (1) patients with FLIPI 0-1 treated with (R)-CHOP (51%), (2) patients under 60 (65) years of age with intermediate-risk disease (FLIPI 2) indicated for an intensive protocol (ProMACE-CytaBOM or sequential chemotherapy) (21%), and (3) patients under 60 (65) years with high-risk disease (FLIPI ≥3) treated with intensive chemotherapy plus autologous stem cell transplantation (28%). Rituximab was added to front-line chemotherapy in 59% of the patients. Generally, complete remission (CR) or unconfirmed CR was achieved in 85% of the patients, 11% had partial remission and 4% stable disease. Molecular CR (CRm) was achieved in 67.4% of 86 evaluable patients. Overall survival (OS) at 5 years reached 84% (95% CI 0.74-0.93); event-free survival (EFS) at 5 years was 58% (95% CI 0.45-0.71). The frequencies of FcγRIIIA-158 gene polymorphisms V/V, V/F and F/F were 8%, 50% and 42%, respectively. The FLIPI score distribution was not different in F/F patients as compared to V/F+V/V carriers (chi-square, P=0.7). The treatment modalities (treatment arm or rituximab administration) had the same distribution in V/V+V/F vs F/F patients (chi-square, P=0.16 and P=0.62, respectively). The CRm rates were similar in both subgroups of V/V+V/F vs F/F patients (chi-square, P=0.92). Survival curves for OS and EFS were not significantly different when comparing the subgroups of V/V+V/F vs F/F patients (P=0.28 and P=0.57, respectively). We found no difference in the quality of treatment response or survival after front-line immunochemotherapy between FcγRIIIA subgroups. FcγRIIIA polymorphism have no influence on the outcome of patients treated with risk-adapted chemotherapy with or without rituximab.
