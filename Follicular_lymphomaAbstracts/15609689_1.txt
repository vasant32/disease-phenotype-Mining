Malignant lymphomas are often associated with immunological disorders. We describe here a 54-year-old woman with follicular lymphoma, simultaneously complicated with autoimmune hemolytic anemia and pure red cell aplasia. The patient had bilateral cervical, axillar and inguinal lymph node swellings. Peripheral blood analysis revealed severe anemia (Hb 3.4g/dl) and reticulocytopenia (2260/ml), and then the bone marrow showed erythroid hypoplasia. Furthermore, a direct Coombs test was positive and the serum haptoglobin level was undetectable. After treatment with CHOP followed by 1 mg/kg of prednisolone daily, the patient obtained complete remission and her anemia improved to the normal level.
