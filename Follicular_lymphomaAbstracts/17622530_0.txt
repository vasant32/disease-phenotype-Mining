A combination of chromosomal translocations associated with bcl-2 re-arrangement (t(14;18)) and c-myc re-arrangement (t(8;14), t(8;22), or t(2;8)) is a rare event. We describe the first cell line exhibiting t(14;18) and t(8;22), which will enable us to study the interactions of bcl-2 and c-myc systematically. Cell culture was started with circulating lymphoma cells from the peripheral blood of an adult male Caucasian patient with Burkitt's lymphoma after the second relapse. The cells grew spontaneously without cytokines, fulfilled all criteria of a cell line and were analysed. An Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome-negative cell line (DoGKiT) has been established. RC-banding analysis of the chromosomes showed a complex karyotype with a modal number of 48, XY, dup(1)(q31;q44), t(8;22)(q24;q11), der(10), t(14;18)(q32;q21), add(16)(pter), dup(17)(q12q24), +der(18), +20. The combination of t(8;22)(q24;q11), a variant translocation of Burkitt's lymphoma and t(14;18)(q32;q21), typical for follicular lymphoma (FL), was confirmed by FISH and SKY-analysis. Surface marker studies of the cell line showed that the cells were positive for CALLA (CD10), CD19, cyCD22, cyCD79a and HLA-DR and negative for TdT, IgM, CD5 and CD23. To our knowledge, this is the first established cell line carrying these two translocations. In contrast to already established cell lines carrying the more common combination of t(8;14)(q24;q32) and t(14;18)(q32;q21) with both IgH alleles being involved in translocations, the cell line DoGKiT carries only one translocated IgH allele. This cell line may serve as an important tool in the study of the combination of the chromosomal translocations t(14;18) and t(8;22) and in molecular genetic studies of transformed FL.
