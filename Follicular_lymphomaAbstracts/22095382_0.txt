Light chain (LC) expression by flow cytometry (FC) in B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (B-NHLs) can occasionally be detected with one anti-LC antibody but not with another. We retrospectively analyzed 564 four-color FC files from B-NHLs, assessing LC staining with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and polyclonal antibodies (pAbs). Discrepancies in LC expression between mAbs and pAbs were present in 9.2% of cases, mainly in chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL; 11.1%), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; 10.2%), follicular lymphoma (9.5%), and mantle cell lymphoma (11.1%) and most frequently in body fluids. Equal proportions of cases were LC+ only with pAbs (4.8%) or mAbs (4.4%). Negative LC expression with both antibodies was present in 7.5% of cases, most frequently in DLBCL (21.6%) and body fluids (27.6%). Evaluation with both mAbs and pAbs increases the sensitivity for LC detection, with no single reagent outperforming the other, although CLL/SLL preferentially showed LC expression with pAbs.
