Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has emerged as a viable option for the treatment of relapsed follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We report on the outpatient experience of 60 patients who underwent ASCT for this condition. The median age was 51 years (30-65). Pre-transplantation conditioning regimens consisted of either etoposide/melphalan/TBI, CBV or BEAM. Patients participated in this transplant program for a median of 20.5 days (14-78), and 58.4% of the total program days were spent in the outpatient setting. Six patients were well enough to be treated solely as outpatients. Ninety percent of patients required at least one inpatient admission (median 7 days), and 70% of first inpatient transfers occurred within the first week following transplant and always before day +12. There were no predictors for prolonged inpatient stays. Febrile neutropenia and gastrointestinal toxicity were the main reasons for inpatient transfers. No outpatient required an urgent admission to the ICU or died in the outpatient setting. The treatment-related mortality at days 30 and 100 was 0 and 1.7%, respectively. The overall and progression-free survivals at 5 years were 65.7 and 56.1%, respectively. Outpatient ASCT with total body irradiation is feasible, safe, and effective for patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma.
