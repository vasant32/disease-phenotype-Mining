The TNF family member TRAIL is emerging as a promising cytotoxic molecule for antitumor therapy. However, its mechanism of action and the possible modulation of its effect by the microenvironment in follicular lymphomas (FL) remain unknown. We show here that TRAIL is cytotoxic only against FL B cells and not against normal B cells, and that DR4 is the main receptor involved in the initiation of the apoptotic cascade. However, the engagement of CD40 by its ligand, mainly expressed on a specific germinal center CD4(+) T cell subpopulation, counteracts TRAIL-induced apoptosis in FL B cells. CD40 induces a rapid RNA and protein up-regulation of c-FLIP and Bcl-x(L). The induction of these antiapoptotic molecules as well as the inhibition of TRAIL-induced apoptosis by CD40 is partially abolished when NF-kappaB activity is inhibited by a selective inhibitor, BAY 117085. Thus, the antiapoptotic signaling of CD40, which interferes with TRAIL-induced apoptosis in FL B cells, involves NF-kappaB-mediated induction of c-FLIP and Bcl-x(L) which can respectively interfere with caspase 8 activation or mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. These findings suggest that a cotreatment with TRAIL and an inhibitor of NF-kappaB signaling or a blocking anti-CD40 Ab could be of great interest in FL therapy.
