 OBJECTIVE: To recognize the importance of analyzing the result of immunohistochemical staining correctly. METHOD: Review of the three misdiagnosed cases lymphoma and exploring the causes of misdiagnosis through reviewing their clinics, histopathology and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Case 1 of lymphocyte rich classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (LRCHL) was misdiagnosed as follicular lymphoma (FL) initially, the RS cells were overlooked morphologically and wrongly determined BCL-2 and CD20-positive cells as tumor cells immunohistochemically; also once misdiagnosed as nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma (NLPHL) because the CD20-negative RS misjudged cells as the positives. Case 2 of AML tumor cells expressed TdT, CD7 and CD43 unspecifically, which misdiagnosed as T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL). Case 3 of type B1 thymoma was misdiagnosed as T-LBL, because CK wasn't expressed satisfactorily resulting in neglecting neoplastic epithelial cells, and lymphocytes in the background were TdT and CD99-positive. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of lymphoma should be based on morphology, immunohistochemistry, clinics, and genetics. Moreover, the correct judgment of immunohistochemical staining is essential to make right diagnosis.
