We examined ten cellular or tissue sources of lymphocytes for specific binding of 1,25(OH)2D3, the hormonally active form of vitamin D3. A specific-binding protein was found in three of these sources. Scatchard analysis of cytosol from a follicular lymphoma cell line revealed binding sites with a Kd of 7.0 X 10(-11) and a receptor concentration of 6.6 fmol/mg protein. Sucrose density centrifugation of 3H-1,25(OH)2D3 labeled cytosol showed a 3.75 peak which was absent in cytosols incubated with excess nonradioactive 1,25(OH)2D3. The relative amounts of vitamin D3 metabolites required to displace 50% of the specifically bound 3H-1,25(OH)2D3 were 1,25(OH)2D3: 1,24,25(OH)3D3: 25(OH)D3: 24,25(OH)2D3 = 1: 180: 1000: 2700. Excess vitamin D3, cortisol, and estradiol failed to displace 3H-1,25(OH)2D3. Scatchard analysis of spleen cytosol from a patient with prolymphocytic transformation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia demonstrated a binding protein with a Kd of 1.2 X 10(-10) and a receptor concentration of 0.2 fmol/mg protein. DNA cellulose binding confirmed the presence of the specific-binding protein in this cytosol. Specific binding of 3H-1,25(OH)2D3 was also quantitated in a cell line from a patient with Burkitt's lymphoma with a Kd of 0.3 X 10(-10) and a receptor concentration of 29.6 fmol/mg protein. No specific binding of 3H-1,25(OH)2D3 was observed in lymphocytes from seven other malignant and nonmalignant sources. These results are the first to demonstrate a specific-binding protein for 1,25(OH)2D3 in lymphocytes from tissue and from these specific cell lines. The presence of this protein in some lymphocytes but not others may reflect the state of activation of the lymphocytes.
