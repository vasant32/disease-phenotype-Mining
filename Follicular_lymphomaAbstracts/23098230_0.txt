Abstract Recombinant interleukin-21 (IL-21) has potential utility in cancer therapy. Stimulation with IL-21 can induce apoptosis in follicular lymphoma (FL) cells, and existing studies have suggested that IL-21 signaling may function in tumor suppression. In order to elucidate the relationship between IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) expression and clinical and pathological features in FL, IL-21R was quantified in 114 pretreatment biopsy samples using either conventional immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence microscopy and automated quantitative analysis (AQUA). Reduced expression of IL-21R was associated with favorable overall survival (p = 0.048). AQUA analysis showed an association with the presence of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in the biopsy sample (p = 0.03), and expression of IL-21R was up-regulated upon transformation of FL to DLBCL in two cases. Our results based on the largest survey to date raise the possibility that IL-21 signaling in FL cells, rather than being tumor suppressive, supports tumor progression and that therapeutic benefit could be realized by blocking IL-21R instead of stimulating it.
