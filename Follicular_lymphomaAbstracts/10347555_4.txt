We report four cases of follicular lymphoma with both t(14;18)(q32;q21) and the newly characterized t(3;4)(q27;p13). Molecular investigation confirmed LAZ3 (BCL6) rearrangement for all patients. The 3q27 aberrations have been rarely described in low-grade lymphomas and may represent secondary events whose implication remains to be elucidated.
