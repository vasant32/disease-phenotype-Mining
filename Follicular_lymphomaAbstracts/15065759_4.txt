The role cell adhesion molecules play in the biological and clinical behaviour of non Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) has been reported in several studies. This study reports the findings on B-cells taken from various healthy control tissues and compared them to B-cells from 83 malignant B-lymphomas, that had been classified according to the WHO classification. Flow cytometry was used to investigate the surface expression of CD31, an adhesion molecule involved in B-cell development and vascular adhesion mechanisms. Quantification of the fluorescence signals showed specific patterns of CD31 expression on normal B-cell subpopulations and different NHL groups. Our results demonstrate that CD31 expression is modulated during the differentiation process in normal B-cells, high in pre-B-I cells, low in pre-B-II precursors, intermediate in the mature B-cell subpopulations or, depending on the functional state absent in activated follicular centre cells, present in pre- and post- germinal centre cells. When the CD31 expression is evaluated as fluorescence intensity in NHL, it reveals a heterogeneous pattern related to histogenetic derivation (high in small lymphocytic lymphoma, low in follicular lymphoma, intermediate in marginal zone and large cell lymphomas). These observations suggest that CD31 might well play a critical role in the ontogeny and physiology of B-lymphocytes. Therefore, on the basis of these observations we propose the CD31 molecule as an interesting additional useful parameter to be used for the differential diagnosis of NHL and hypothese that it has a pathophysiologic role in NHL evolution.
