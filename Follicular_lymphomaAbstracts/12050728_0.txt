The authors analyze the progress achieved in the treatment of low-grade as well as of high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. The challenging task in the treatment of low-grade or indolent lymphomas still is to decide whether watchful waiting is sufficient or whether chemotherapy is necessary and how aggressive this treatment should be. Among the new chemotherapeutic agents the role of purine analogues should be emphasized, fludarabin is especially important in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and follicular lymphoma, while pentostatin and cladribine have revolutionized the treatment of hairy cell leukemia. Treatment with monoclonal antibodies, radioimmunoconjugates as well as autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation are potential new therapeutic options in the treatment of low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. In the case of aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphomas risk-adapted strategies help the choice between standard or more intensive treatment options. In patients with relapsed high-grade lymphomas stem cell transplantation is indicated. In patients with marginal zone lymphoma the combination of hyperCVAD protocol + stem cell transplantation greatly improves prognosis.
