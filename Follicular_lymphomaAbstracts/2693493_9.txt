Argyrophilic nucleolar organiser regions (AgNORs) in 28 follicular lymphomas and 30 lymph nodes showing reactive follicular hyperplasia were studied to see if they were helpful in distinguishing follicular lymphoma from follicular hyperplasia in paraffin wax tissue sections. Mean nuclear counts were greater in follicular hyperplasia (3.71 v 3.11). This difference was significant but counts overlapped so much that they were of no practical value in distinguishing between both conditions. Higher counts may reflect greater proliferative activity in follicular hyperplasia.
