BCL10 is directly involved in t(1;14)(p22;q32) of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Wild-type BCL10 promoted apoptosis and suppressed malignant transformation in vitro, whereas truncated mutants lost the pro-apoptotic activity and exhibited gain of function enhancement of transformation. We studied 220 lymphomas for genomic BCL10 mutation by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformational polymorphism and DNA sequencing. Nineteen mutations were found in 13 lymphoma specimens, as follows: 8 of 120 (6.7%) mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas, 4 of 42 (9.5%) follicular lymphomas, and 1 of 23 (4.3%) diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. No mutations were found in 14 mantle cell lymphomas or 21 T-cell lymphomas. High-grade MALT lymphoma tended to show a slightly higher mutation frequency (2 of 25, 8%) than low-grade MALT tumor (6 of 95, 6.3%). Among low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma, mutations were found in 3 of 11 tumors that did not respond to Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy, but none were found in 22 tumors that regressed completely after H pylori eradication. All 14 potentially pathogenic mutations were distributed in the carboxyl terminal domain of BCL10. Deletion accounted for 10 of these mutations; 10 of 14 mutations caused truncated forms of BCL10. Western blot analysis of a mutant case confirmed the presence of truncated BCL10 products of anticipated size. Our results suggest that BCL10 mutation may play a pathogenic role in B-cell lymphoma development, particularly in aggressive and antibiotic unresponsive MALT lymphomas, and may further implicate the biologic importance of the carboxyl terminal of the molecule.
