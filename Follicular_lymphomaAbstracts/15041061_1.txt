A case of composite lymphoma (CL) arisen in the parotid gland in a 58-year-old male is reported. Histologically, most of the tumor region was follicular lymphoma (FL), grade 2. However complicating classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) was noted inside the lesion. There have been a few reports of composite lymphoma, complicated by multiple histologic types in the same organ. Extra-nodal cases are particularly rare. This is a very significant case with regard to differences between B cell-derived non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and its histological origin.
