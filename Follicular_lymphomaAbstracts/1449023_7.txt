This study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of follicular lymphoma (FL). Fourteen aspirates of lymph nodes in which follow-up surgical biopsy revealed FL were studied. Two aspirates were deemed unsatisfactory because of a paucity of cells. The remaining 12 cases received the following diagnoses: 4 positive for malignant lymphoma, 4 highly suspicious for malignant lymphoma and 4 false negatives. FNAB of FL can show a monomorphic or polymorphic cell population. The aspirates with a positive or suspicious diagnosis showed monomorphic cell populations. False-negative diagnoses were attributable to misleading sampling or preparation methods in most cases. We conclude that FNAB of FL is less accurate than FNAB of non-Hodgkin's malignant lymphoma (NHL) in general, but the accuracy rate is similar to that of FNAB of all low-grade NHL. The value of current approaches to the diagnosis of suspected lymphoma by FNAB is emphasized.
