The results of cytogenetic studies are reported in 76 patients with B-chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (B-CLPD): 60 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), six with follicular lymphoma in leukemic phase (FLLP), five with splenic B-cell lymphoma with villous lymphocytes (SLVL), two with chronic prolymphocytic leukemia (CPL), two with hairy cell leukemia (HCL), and one with plasma cell leukemia (PCL). PHA (phytohemagglutinin), PWM (pokeweed mitogen), LPS (lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia Coli), TPA (phorbol 12-myristate acetate), IL6 (interleukin 6), and DxS (dextran sulfate) were used as mitogens. Mitoses were obtained in 75 cases. Clonal aberrations could be demonstrated in 34 cases (44%). In CLL, classical type, chromosomes 6, 11, and 13 were more frequently involved, whereas trisomy 12 was frequently found in CLL mixed-cell type, in FLLP, and CPL. In SLVL the deletion del(7)(q32) is noteworthy and miscellaneous chromosome abnormalities in the remaining patients were observed. Regarding the efficiency of mitogens, PHA turned to be the most effective in obtaining metaphases and in detecting clonal chromosomal aberrations.
