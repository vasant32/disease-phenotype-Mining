Follicular lymphoma (FL) is characterized by the presence of a t(14;18) chromosomal translocation that results in overexpression of bcl-2 protein. Bcl-2/IgH gene rearrangement is detected in 80-90% of follicular lymphomas in Western countries. The aim of this study was to analyze the bcl-2/IgH rearrangement in FL lymphoma patients in Serbia, by PCR technique, correlate molecular findings with clinical characteristics and outcome and assess the prognostic significance of these rearrangements. One hundred-seven patients (median age, 54 years; male/female ratio:60/47) diagnosed with FL were included in the study. DNA samples were obtained from paraffin embedded lymphoid tissue of patients. Bcl-2/IgH rearrangement was assessed for the major breakpoint region (MBR), 5' MBR and the minor cluster region (mcr) breakpoints by PCR technique. We detected a t(14;18) in 81.3% (87/107) of patients. The distribution of bcl-2-IgH rearrangement was as follows: 88,5% (77/87) in MBR breakpoint, 10,35% (9/87) in 5' MBR, whereas mcr bcl-2-IgH rearrangement was observed in one patient (1.15%). No rearrangements were detected in remaining 20 patients (18.7%). This is the first analyses of the frequency of the bcl-2/IgH gene rearrangement in Serbian FL patients, as well as in Eastern European countries. There was no correlation between presence of bcl-2/IgH gene rearrangement and clinical outcome of disease. Incidence of bcl-2/IgH gene rearrangement in Serbian FL patients is relatively high, and similar to frequency in Western countries. Presence of this rearrangement in tumor tissue is not of prognostic significance.
