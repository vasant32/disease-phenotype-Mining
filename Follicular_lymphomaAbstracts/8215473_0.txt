High-dose ACNU followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation was administered alone or together with other agents such as cyclophosphamide, dacarbazine, carboquone or/and VP-16. The starting dose of ACNU was 200 mg/m2, with gradual escalation up to 400 mg/m2. Median duration of granulocytes of less than 100/mm3 and platelets of less than 30,000/mm3 was 4.5 days (range; 0-9) and 10.5 days (range; 0-43), respectively. Bacteremia occurred in 4 cases, but no case of pneumonia was encountered. Heart failure possibly due to the cyclophosphamide was noted in one case with arrhythmia. Out of 13 cases with measurable diseases, three patients with Hodgkin's disease, two patients with diffuse lymphoma, and one patient with follicular lymphoma attained a complete response. Partial response was obtained in two patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Two patients with melanoma and one with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia without measurable disease still remain disease-free.
