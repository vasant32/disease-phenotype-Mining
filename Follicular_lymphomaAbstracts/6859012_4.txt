This paper describes a unique case of combined malignant lymphoma of the jejunum and multiple synchronous carcinomas of colon and rectum. The jejunal tumor developed obstructive growth without regional lymph node involvement. Histologically, it was a malignant lymphoma corresponding to medium-sized cell type of follicular lymphoma, suggesting B cell origin in the bowel wall. In the colon and rectum, except for the transverse segment, there were three encircling, annular infiltrative tumors, and six polyps with malignant change. They developed independently, separated by an intact mucosa suggesting multiple synchronous cancers. Histologically they showed adenocarcinoma with or without mucus production, adenosquamous cell carcinoma, and villotubular adenocarcinoma. A case report is presented with a brief review of the incidence and pathogenesis of both jejunal and colonic tumors.
