A 85-year old patient with an history of low grade follicular lymphoma was admitted in the hospital with a superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. The computed tomography scan of the thorax and the trans-esophageal echocardiography revealed a voluminous mass in the right atrium, extending to the origin of the SVC. A transvenous biopsy was done under echocardiographic control. The immunohistology showed a diffuse large B cell lymphoma. He received chemotherapy associating rituximab, doxorubicine, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone. The clinical response after the second cycle was remarkable with a near complete regression of the SVC syndrome. The tumor was no longer visible in imaging after four cycles of treatment.
