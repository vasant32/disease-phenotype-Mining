Twenty six adult patients with low grade nodular non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) were treated with autologous bone marrow transplantation. Conditioning regimen was BEAM-BEAC in 15 patients and TBI + Cyclophosphamide in 11 patients. Twenty one patients were grafted with haematopoietic stem cells, 12 after bone marrow purging and five with peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). Two patients were treated in CR1 of leukemic phase, six in PR1 and eighteen in sensitive relapse. With a median follow-up of 30 months, the actuarial survival is 91% and actuarial event free survival 67%. These data confirm some interest of ABMT in the treatment of low grade follicular NHL.
