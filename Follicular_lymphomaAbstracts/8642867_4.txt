Stimulation of the CD40 antigen on normal B cells by crosslinking of anti-CD40 mAbs via their Fc receptor using a Fc gamma RII(CD32)-transfected mouse fibroblast cell line ('CD40 system') results in activation and proliferation. Not only normal B cells, but also malignant B cells fitting in the low-grade malignancy category such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), hairy cell leukemia and follicular lymphoma could be induced to proliferation upon CD40 stimulation. Here, the 'CD40 system' has also been used to culture intermediate and high grade malignancies. Proliferation was measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation and cell counting after culture. Time curves showed that at day 7 most cultures were optimal. By flow cytometry, morphology and assessment of light chain restriction the monoclonal nature of the cultured B cells was proven. We confirmed that B cell malignancies with a more slowly evolving course, such as CLL (n=11), PLL (n=5), and low-grade NHL (immunocytoma and follicular cb/cc n=9), could successfully be cultured in the 'CD40 system'. In contrast, four out of seven cases of mantle cell lymphoma did not proliferate. Cases of precursor B lineage ALL (n=7), high grade NHL (n=3) and multiple myeloma (n=10) showed a heterogenous growth pattern. We conclude that the 'CD40 system', although not always successful, is a useful tool to culture a whole variety of B cell malignancies.
