 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic role of nuclear expression of bcl-10 protein in extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type. METHODS: One hundred and forty cases of MALT lymphoma were collected from Cancer Hospital of Fudan University (including 38 cases from stomach, 35 cases from ocular adnexa, 16 cases from intestine, 15 cases from skin, 15 cases from salivary gland, 14 cases from lung, 3 cases from thyroid and 4 cases from other sites). Ten cases of reactive follicular hyperplasia of tonsil, 5 cases of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia of orbit and 143 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma other than MALT lymphoma (including 20 cases of NK/T cell lymphoma, 20 cases of follicular lymphomas, 20 cases of anaplastic large cell lymphomas, 20 cases of nodal diffuse large cell B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 10 cases of gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 13 cases of nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, 12 cases of mantle cell lymphoma, 11 cases of splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, 6 cases of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, 6 cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, 3 cases of small lymphocytic lymphoma, 1 case of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and 1 case of plasmacytoma were used as controls. Immunohistochemical study for bcl-10, as well as dual staining with CD20, was performed by EnVision method in paraffin sections. RESULTS: In reactive follicular hyperplasia of tonsil, bcl-10 was moderately or strongly expressed in the cytoplasm of germinal center B cells, while the mantle cells were negative and the marginal zone cells and paracortical T cells showed weak staining. In the 5 cases of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia of orbit, 2 were bcl-10-negative and the remaining 3 expressed bcl-10 in the cytoplasm of germinal center B cells. As for non-MALT lymphomas, 3 gastric DLBCL showed nuclear expression. The remaining cases showed variable cytoplasmic staining. In some cases of lymphoma, bcl-10 was expressed in tumor cells but not in reactive lymphoid cells. On the other hand, 92.1% (129/140) of MALT lymphoma were bcl-10 positive. Among those cases, 54.3% (76/140) showed cytoplasmic positivity and 37.9% (53/140) showed nuclear positivity. The nuclear positivity rate of bcl-10 in different anatomic sites was different. The staining was most intense in MALT lymphoma of ocular adnexa. Dual staining with CD20 showed that the bcl-10-positive cells were also CD20-positive, though the number of bcl-10-positive cells were less than that of CD20-positive cells. CONCLUSIONS: Bcl-10 expression in lymphoid hyperplasia is a universal phenomenon. Cytoplasmic expression of bcl-10 is seen in many different kinds of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and reactive lymphoid conditions. In some cases of lymphoma, bcl-10 is expressed in tumor cells but not in reactive lymphoid cells, suggesting a possible role of abnormal bcl-10 expression in tumorgenesis. Nuclear expression of bcl-10 is seen mainly in MALT lymphoma, especially when occurring in ocular adnexa and lung. This is in contrast to loss of bcl-10 expression in residual germinal center cells.
