Percutaneous minimally invasive radiofrequency (RF) ablation has not been described for lymphoma. This image-guided modality is presented in 3 different settings for the treatment of refractory lymphoma. The first patient received RF ablation for the curative treatment of a solitary residual hepatic mass following rituximab-based chemotherapy for a posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) and is disease-free 4 years later. The second patient received RF ablation for successful palliation of progressive follicular lymphoma adjacent to the bladder wall following chemotherapy and maximum radiation. The third patient received RF ablation for prevention of airway obstruction from progressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the right neck following chemotherapy and maximum radiation. RF ablation may be clinically beneficial and should be considered for the treatment of local lymphoma that is refractory or not amenable to standard approaches.
