Twelve cases of follicular centroblastic/centrocytic malignant lymphoma were studied for acid non-specific esterase. The majority of the lymphocytes in interfollicular areas showed a pattern of enzymatic activity consistent with a T-cell nature. Variable numbers of lymphocytes with a similar enzymatic pattern were also seen among the negative centroblasts and centrocytes in neoplastic follicles.
