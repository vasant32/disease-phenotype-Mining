 PURPOSE: We determined the potential value of protein profiling of tissue samples by assessing how precise this approach enables discrimination of B-cell lymphoma from reactive lymph nodes, and how well the profiles can be used for lymphoma classification. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Protein lysates from lymph nodes (n=239) from patients with the diagnosis of reactive hyperplasia (n=44), follicular lymphoma (n=63), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n=43), mantle cell lymphoma (n=47), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic B-cell lymphoma (n=42) were analysed by SELDI-TOF MS. Data analysis was performed by (i) classification and regression tree-based analysis and (ii) binary and polytomous logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: After internal validation by the leave-one-out principle, both the classification and regression tree and logistic regression classification correctly identified the majority of the malignant (87 and 96%, respectively) and benign cases (73 and 75%, respectively). Classification was less successful since approximately one-third of the cases of each group were misclassified according to the histological classification. However, an additional mantle cell lymphoma case that was misclassified as chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic B-cell lymphoma initially was identified based on the protein profile. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: SELDI-TOF MS protein profiling allows for reliable identification of the majority of malignant lymphoma cases; however, further validation and testing robustness in a diagnostic setting is needed.
