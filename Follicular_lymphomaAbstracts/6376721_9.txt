Sixty-two patients with follicular large cell lymphoma were treated between 1973 and 1981. The overall median survival was 78 months with a five-year survival of 62%. The complete remission rate was 76%, with a median relapse-free interval of 72 months for responders. Complete remission produced a significantly longer survival than partial response and failure. Patients who tolerated therapy with an intensive doxorubicin-containing regimen had a significantly longer relapse-free interval and survival. Patients with stage I-II disease treated with radiation therapy alone had a higher relapse rate than those treated with radiation and combination chemotherapy. The addition of radiation therapy to combination chemotherapy in stage III-IV disease decreased the incidence of relapse at irradiated sites, but did not translate into improved survival. Pretreatment prognostic factors associated with poor response were thrombocytosis and stage III-IV disease; those associated with shortened survival were thrombocytosis, elevated lactic dehydrogenase level, stage III-IV disease, and bulky abdominal disease. Follicular large cell lymphoma is an aggressive lymphoma. Treatment should be curative in intent, and should include intensive combination chemotherapy even in stage I-II disease. Knowledge of important prognostic factors can be useful for analysis of future trials and planning therapeutic strategies.
