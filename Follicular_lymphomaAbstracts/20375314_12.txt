Follicular lymphoma has considerable clinical heterogeneity, and there is a need for easily quantifiable prognostic biomarkers. Microvessel density has been shown to be a useful prognostic factor based on numerical assessment of vessel numbers within histologic sections in some studies, but assessment of tumor neovascularization through angiogenic sprouting may be more relevant. We therefore examined the smallest vessels, single-staining structures measuring less than 30 microm(2) in area, seen within histologic sections, and confirmed that they were neovascular angiogenic sprouts using extended focal imaging. Tissue microarrays composing diagnostic biopsies from patients at the extremes of survival of follicular lymphoma were analyzed with respect to numbers of these sprouts. This analysis revealed higher angiogenic activity in the poor prognostic group and demonstrated an association between increased sprouting and elevated numbers of infiltrating CD163(+) macrophages within the immediate microenvironment surrounding the neovascular sprout.
