Trisomy 12, t(14;18)(q32;q21), and t(8;14)(q24.1;q11.2) were found in a 59-year-old man with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). While trisomy 12 is one of the most common cytogenetic abnormalities in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the t(14;18) rearrangement has a strong association with follicular lymphoma and the t(8;14) is associated with T-cell neoplasia. Occurrence of these three abnormalities in CLL are rare, and the significance of this finding is unclear. Further studies of similar cases may shed additional insight into this finding.
