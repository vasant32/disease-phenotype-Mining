The antiviral, antiproliferative and immunomodulating effect of interferon alpha (INF alpha) has led to its widespread use in malignant diseases. In hematology, the clinical effect of INF alpha has been proven empirically for several lymphoid malignancies--hairy cell leukemia, chronic lymphoid leukemia, multiple myeloma, follicular lymphoma--and also for chronic myeloproliferative diseases, particularly chronic myeloid leukemia. However, after 10 years of use, the impact of INF alpha on patient management compared with conventional treatments remains a matter of debate. Interest in cost-containment and the frequency of adverse effects after long-term treatment also raises many questions. A critical analysis of the role of INF alpha in each specific indication is thus required.
