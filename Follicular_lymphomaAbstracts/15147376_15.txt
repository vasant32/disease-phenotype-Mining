Previously, we have shown that patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) transplanted with contaminated bone marrow (BM) generally have a poor outcome. Whether this is also the case when peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) grafts are used is not known. Forty-three patients with chemosensitive DLBCL or follicular lymphoma grade 3 (FLgr3) were treated with high-dose therapy (HDT) and autologous stem cell support. Nine patients received purged grafts. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) for either the BCL2/IgH translocation or allele specific oligonucleotide (ASO) QRT-PCR for the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) complementarity-determining region 3 were used. Nine of 25 (36%) PBPC grafts contained tumour cells as tested by QRT-PCR, including two grafts purged by CD34(+) cell enrichment combined with B-cell depletion. The level of contamination of the PBPC/CD34(+) cells ranged from 0 to 8.28%. No relationship could be shown between the total number of tumour cells infused and relapse. Patients receiving PCR-positive or PCR-negative PBPC grafts had similar progression-free survival (PFS) (P = 0.49). However, a significant difference was seen in PFS and overall survival (OS) for the patients given >/=6.1 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg compared with those given <6.1 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg (P = 0.01 and P < 0.05 respectively).
