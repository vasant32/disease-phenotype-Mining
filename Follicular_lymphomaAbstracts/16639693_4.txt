Very few prognostic factors are known in follicular lymphoma (FL), a common malignancy of germinal centre (GC) B-cells. The Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) thus far appears to be the most important predictor of clinical outcome. This study explores the predictive power of the degree of GC differentiation for outcome in FL. Samples from 73 patients with FL were evaluated by immunohistochemistry for expression of GC markers. Strong PU.1, CD20, and CD75 expression were significantly associated with longer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results for PFS were independent of the International Prognostic Index or the Italian Lymphoma Intergroup prognostic index for CD75 and PU.1, but only PU.1 expression was independent of FLIPI for PFS and OS. Oct-2 was weakly expressed overall, but more strongly in higher grades of FL; it had a trend for negative linear association with PU.1 and strong positive linear association with CD27, which possibly reflects its role in terminal B-cell differentiation. We show that the level of GC differentiation, as determined by the levels of PU.1, CD75, CD20, Bcl-6, and CD10 expression, has an association with outcome in patients with FL. While this is determined qualitatively in most studies of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, in FL there is a quantitative positive association between a high level of expression of GC antigens and longer OS and PFS even when data are stratified by the FLIPI score.
