The authors describe the results of histological, cytomorphological, cytochemical and immunological studies carried out in two cases of follicular lymphoma characterized at onset by an exceptional degree of splenomegaly. Although several different histological types seem to be capable of giving rise to prominent splenic involvement, the authors, on the basis of the reported findings, suggest the possibility that some cases of follicular lymphoma presenting with conspicuous splenomegaly and which at present are classified in the group of the so-called intermediate lymphocytic lymphoma, might be an expression of proliferation of a cell type normally recognizable in the marginal zone of the splenic follicles.
