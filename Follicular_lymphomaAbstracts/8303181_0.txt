Follicular lymphomas are a subgroup of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas with a low-grade malignancy. They are characterized by a frequent chromosome abnormality, a translocation between chromosome 14 and chromosome 18. This translocation plays a role in the development of this disease. The course of follicular lymphomas is slow, usually lasting several years but is ultimately fatal, Their treatment is controversial. Recently, an association of chemotherapy and alpha interferon appeared promising. Other drugs such as fludarabine or 2' chlorodeoxyadenosine are currently tested.
