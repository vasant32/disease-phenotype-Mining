 OBJECTIVE: To determine whether follicular lymphoma (FL) can be graded on fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies by determining the percentage of centroblasts in the neoplastic follicles on the smears. STUDY DESIGN: Eighty-nine cases of histologically confirmed cases of FL, including 31 grade 1, 46 grade 2 and 12 grade 3, were evaluated. Proliferative index (PI) by DNA image analysis (DIA) and Ki-67 labeling index (LI) were obtained on all cases. A minimum of 200 cells were counted per case (range, 200-800 cells) at 40x magnification, and the number of large cells (centroblasts) was expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells counted within the follicles. RESULTS: The percentage of centroblasts in the follicular aggregates was 9.7 +/- 2.9% in grade 1 FLs, 24.7 +/- 5.6% in grade 2 and 48.4 +/- 7.5% in grade 3. These differences were significant (P < .05). DNA image analysis of PI and Ki-67 LI differed significantly between grade 1 FLs and grade 2 and 3 FLs (P < .05), but there were no significant differences between grade 2 and 3 FLs. CONCLUSION: Determining the percentage of centroblasts in the follicular aggregates on FNA specimens is a good method of grading FLs. Using the percentage of centroblasts per follicular structure, FL grades 1, 2 and 3 were adequately distinguished. PI by DIA and Ki-67 LI clearly distinguished FL grade 1 from FL grades 2 and 3; however, it did not clearly distinguish between grades 2 and 3.
