Bisphosphonates (BPs) are potent inhibitors of osteoclast function, widely used to treat excessive bone resorption associated with bone metastases, that also have anti-tumor activity. Zoledronic acid (ZOL) represents a potential chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of cancer. ZOL is the most potent nitrogen-containing BPs, and it inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells. Recently we demonstrated that accumulation of isopentenyl pyrophosphate and the consequent formation of a new type of ATP analog (ApppI) after mevalonate pathway inhibition by nitrogen-containing BPs strongly correlates with ZOL-induced cell death in cancer cells in vitro. In this study we show that ZOL-induced apoptosis in HF28RA human follicular lymphoma cells occurs exclusively via the mitochondrial pathway, involves lysosomes, and is dependent on mevalonate pathway inhibition. To define the exact signaling pathway connecting them, we used modified HF28RA cell lines overexpressing either BclXL or dominant-negative caspase-9. In both mutant cells, mitochondrial and lysosomal membrane permeabilization (MMP and LMP) were totally prevented, indicating signaling between lysosomes and mitochondria and, additionally, an amplification loop for MMP and/or LMP regulated by caspase-9 in association with farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase inhibition. Additionally, the lysosomal pathway in ZOL-induced apoptosis plays an additional/amplification role of the intrinsic pathway independently of caspase-3 activation. Moreover, we show a potential regulation by Bcl-XL and caspase-9 on cell cycle regulators of S-phase. Our findings provide a molecular basis for new strategies concomitantly targeting cell death pathways from multiple sites.
