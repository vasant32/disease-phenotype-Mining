We studied 34 low- and 30 high-grade CD10+ B-cell lymphomas. Forward light scatter (FSC) and CD71 fluorescence intensity (CD71i) of tumor cells were measured and normalized by corresponding values for resting T cells. Significant differences in CD71i values between low- and high-grade lymphomas were observed by the Mann-Whitney U test (P < .001) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (P < .001). FSC was not significantly different between low- and high-grade lymphomas; the area under the ROC curve was less than that for CD71i. Neither FSC nor CD71i significantly differentiated follicular lymphoma (FL) grades. A comparison of all FLs (grades 1-3) and non-FL high-grade lymphomas (Burkitt lymphoma [BL] and large B-cell lymphoma [LBCL]) showed significant differences in CD71i (P < .001) and FSC (P = .021). Differences were significant in CD71i and FSC between FL and LBCL (P < .001) but not between FL and BL. CD71i is more potent than FSC for distinguishing CD10+ low- from high-grade lymphomas and FL from non-FL high-grade lymphomas. Sensitivity and specificity are limited owing to inability to identify FL3. In ROC analysis, a high value for CD71i can identify BL and LBCL with a high degree of certainty.
