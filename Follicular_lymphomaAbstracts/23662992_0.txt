ABSTRACT A common treatment for follicular lymphoma is rituximab monotherapy. To identify patients for whom this regimen is adequate as first-line therapy, we applied the World Health Organization (WHO) classification for grading follicular lymphoma in a prospective central pathology review of the biopsies of previously untreated patients in two randomized trials of rituximab without chemotherapy. In the first trial (N1=53), higher WHO grades correlated with longer time to next treatment, independently of clinical prognostic factors (p=0.030); the finding was replicated in the second trial (N2=221; p=0.019). Higher grades were associated with better treatment responses (p=0.018). Furthermore, also grades externally confirmed by independent local pathologists correlated with time to next treatment (p=0.048). Flow cytometry in a separate patient series showed that the intensity of CD20 increased with the malignant cells' size (p<0.00005). In conclusion, WHO grade 1 follicular lymphoma correlates with inferior outcome after rituximab monotherapy. WHO grading might provide a clinically useful tool for personalized therapy.
