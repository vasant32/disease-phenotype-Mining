Lymphocyte subpopulations were profiled in lymph nodes and tonsils showing follicular hyperplasia and in follicular lymphomas with monoclonal antibodies on frozen tissue sections. Immunoregulatory lymphocyte subsets identified with T8 and Leu-7 monoclonal antibodies were quantified within the follicular centers (FC) of the nonneoplastic tissue and neoplastic follicles of the lymphomas with an optical grid defining a unit surface area (USA) of 0.04 mm2. T8+ cells were essentially confined to the interfollicular areas, with a few cells occupying the FC of the nonneoplastic specimens (mean, two and five cells/USA for tonsils and benign lymph nodes, respectively). Although lymphomas exhibited a similar pattern of distribution of T8+ cells, 17 T8+ cells/USA were observed in the follicular small cleaved cell (FSCL) group and eight T8+ cells/USA within the follicular mixed small cleaved and large cell (FML) group. Leu-7+ cells were almost entirely confined to the FC of the nonneoplastic tissues and increased (mean, 17 and 19 cells/USA for tonsils and benign lymph nodes, respectively) compared with the T8+ population. Variable distributions of Leu-7+ cells were found in the FSCL group, with a mean of 16 cells/USA. Very few Leu-7+ cells were present in the FML group. Natural killer cells and/or cytotoxic/suppressor T lymphocytes may play an immunoregulatory role in modulating the growth of follicular lymphomas.
