Chemotaxis in leukocytes is mediated through binding of soluble chemokines to transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors. The chemokine receptor CXCR3 has been previously shown to be widely expressed on activated T cells and to mediate T-cell chemotaxis on binding to various ligands, including Mig, IP-10, and ITAC. By using immunohistochemical and flow cytometric analysis, we report that CXCR3 is also expressed on a subset of peripheral blood B cells and in distinct subtypes of B-cell lymphoma. CXCR3 immunohistochemical or flow cytometric expression was seen in 37 of 39 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (diffusely positive in 33 cases), whereas mantle cell lymphoma (30 cases), follicular lymphoma (27 cases), and small noncleaved cell lymphoma (8 cases) were negative in all but 2 cases. Strong CXCR3 expression was also seen in splenic marginal zone lymphoma (14 of 14 cases) and in the monocytoid and plasmacytic cells in extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (15 of 16 cases). This differential expression of CXCR3 in B-cell tumors contrasts with that of another B-cell-associated chemokine receptor, BLR1/CXCR5, which we show here is expressed on all types of B-cell lymphoma tested. We also report that the CXCR3 ligand, Mig, is coexpressed on tumor cells in many cases of CLL/SLL (10 of 13 cases examined) with Mig expression less frequently seen in other B-cell lymphoma subtypes. Coexpression of CXCR3 and its ligand, Mig, may be an important functional interaction in B-CLL, as well as a useful diagnostic marker for the differential diagnosis of small cell lymphomas.
