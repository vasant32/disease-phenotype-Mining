Lymphomas are classified according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) classification which defines subtypes on the basis of clinical, morphological, immunophenotypic, molecular and cytogenetic criteria. Differential diagnosis of the subtypes is sometimes difficult, especially for small B-cell lymphoma (SBCL). Standardisation of molecular genetic assays using multiple gene expression analysis by microarrays could be a useful complement to the current diagnosis. The aim of the present study was to develop a low density DNA microarray for the analysis of 107 genes associated with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and to evaluate its performance in the diagnosis of SBCL. A predictive tool based on Fisher discriminant analysis using a training set of 40 patients including four different subtypes (follicular lymphoma n = 15, mantle cell lymphoma n = 7, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia n = 6 and splenic marginal zone lymphoma n = 12) was designed. A short additional preliminary analysis to gauge the accuracy of this signature was then performed on an external set of nine patients. Using this model, eight of nine of those samples were classified successfully. This pilot study demonstrates that such a microarray tool may be a promising diagnostic approach for small B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
