We have examined three cases of human lymphoma bearing a t(2;18)(p11;q21) chromosome translocation. The bcl-2 gene appeared to be rearranged in all three cases and breakpoints were clustered in the 5' flanking region of the gene. In all three cases, bcl-2 was juxtaposed to J segments of the Ig kappa gene. This juxtaposition of the bcl-2 and Ig kappa genes is very similar to the variant chromosome translocations of Burkitt lymphoma that juxtapose the c-myc locus to IgL genes.
