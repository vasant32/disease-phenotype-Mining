We reported in this study a treatment results about 36 Africans patients with follicular lymphoma. The average age of patients was 18 to 73 years old with a median age at 50.83 years old and a sex ratio of 1. Clinical characteristics of patients are mainly represented by advance stage with 70% of stage III and IV of Ann Arbor classification. Histological, we mainly notified follicular lymphoma constituted of small cells 50%, followed by mixed follicular and large cells lymphomas with respectively 27.78 and 22.22%. Using varieties of therapeutics regiments, we obtained 41.67% of complete remission. There were significant correlations between complete remission and histology subtypes. Indeed, the follicular lymphomas constituted by large cells and mixed cells had higher rate of complete remission with respectively 46.67% and 40% in relation with those of small cells with a higher failure rate. Median follow-up was 24 months, the estimated 5-years overall survival and event-free survival were 22%. After a long period, 25 cases of death have been reported, 5 cases of losing sight and 6 patients are still alive and following treatment. Our results are lowers than the reported case in developing country. This none satisfying was in relation with the lower socio-economical level of the main part of the patients. The short survival delay time of our patients didn't permit time to observe transformation case in diffuse large cell lymphomas.
