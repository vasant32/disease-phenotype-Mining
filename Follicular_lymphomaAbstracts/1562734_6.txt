There have been conflicting reports about the occurrence of the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation in Hodgkin's disease. A polymerase chain reaction analysis of biopsy specimens from 21 patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD) has shown the presence of the t(14;18) translocation in four cases (20%). All four patients had nodular sclerosing HD. Direct sequencing of the amplified 14q+ junctions established that the BCL-2 (major breakpoint region) sequence was fused to an Ig joining region (JH) (J6 in all four cases). Different breakpoints were observed in each case but were similar in nature to the breakpoints described in follicular lymphoma. The exact nature and cell of origin in HD remains obscure, although the presence of the t(14;18) translocation may reflect either a B-cell origin in these cases or associated lymphoid hyperplasia.
