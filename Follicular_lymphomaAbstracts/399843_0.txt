Membrane markers of lymphomatous cells were studied in 33 patients with non Hodgkin's lymphoma and correlated with morphological diagnosis according to Rappaport's classification. Nodular lymphomas and the majority of lymphocytic lymphomas showed B cell characteristics, whereas only 6 out of 23 with diffuse pattern were B. None of the histiocytic lymphomas were B, 3 were T, and 4 non T-non B. Mixed lymphocytic/histiocytic lymphomas showed different immunological patterns (B, T, non T-non B, B and T). These results confirm the importance of functional classification, which can clarify the pathogenesis of lymphoma.
