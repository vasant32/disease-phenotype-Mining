Inherited risk determinants for follicular lymphoma (FL) have recently been described in the immune gene-rich human leukocyte antigen region on chromosome 6p. The known importance of host immune response to FL survival led us to evaluate these germline factors in FL outcome. We confirm the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms rs10484561 (P = 3.5 × 10⁻⁹) and rs6457327 (P = .008) with risk of FL and demonstrate that rs6457327 predicts both time to (P = .02) and risk of (P < .01) FL transformation independently of clinical variables, including the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index.
