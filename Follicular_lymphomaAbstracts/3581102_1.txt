A total of 50 evaluable adult patients with relapsing lymphoma and two with Hodgkin's disease received bisantrene by central iv catheter every 3 weeks, at doses of 350 mg/m2 for patients with adequate marrow reserve and 300 mg/m2 for those with compromised marrow reserve. The overall response rate was 30% for 50 patients with malignant lymphoma, including seven complete remissions (14%) and eight partial remissions (16%). Neither patient with Hodgkin's disease responded. The 16 patients with follicular lymphomas did particularly well, with 31% attaining complete remission and 25% attaining partial remission. Five of seven complete responders remain in remission at 16-24+ months; two have relapsed, at 13 and 20 months. Leukopenia, of brief duration, was the most common toxic effect. Fever during neutropenia occurred in 23% of courses. There was minimal cardiotoxicity with cumulative doses of up to 7080 mg/m2 of bisantrene. Bisantrene is an effective and well-tolerated agent for the treatment of malignant lymphoma.
