Testicular involvement with indolent lymphoma is extremely rare, particularly in the absence of transformation to an aggressive histology. We report a case of a 64-year-old man who presented with cervical lymphadenopathy. Staging CT scans revealed extensive lymphadenopathy as well as bilateral testicular and epididymal masses. Histologic examination of lymph node, bone marrow, and testicular/epididymal biopsies revealed involvement with grade I follicular lymphoma. The patient was started on chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, and rituximab in addition to intrathecal methotrexate and testicular radiation. He is now 6 months into therapy and responding well. A review of the literature demonstrated this to be the first confirmed case of testicular and epididymal involvement with grade I follicular lymphoma.
