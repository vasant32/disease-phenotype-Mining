Clinical data of the 50 patients with nodal follicular lymphoma were collected from 4 institutions in Japan and were analysed retrospectively. A frequency of follicular lymphoma was 9.3% in the 364 patients with nodal lymphoma registered between 1981-1986. Twenty-one patients (42%) were classified as follicular medium-sized cell type (F-medium; identical with follicular small cleaved cell type by Working Formulation criteria), 12 (24%) as follicular mixed (F-mixed), and 17 (34%) as follicular large (F-large). There were 31 (62%) patients with Stage III-IV disease involving bone marrow in 6 patients, liver in 2, bone marrow and liver in 2, stomach in 1. Overall five- and ten-year survival rates were 65% and 32%, respectively, in the 49 patients whose median follow-up period was 3 years, ranging from 2 to 11 years. Adriamycin-based combination chemotherapy [ADM(+) therapy] produced 10 (100%) complete response (CR) of 10 patients with F-large lymphoma and 8 (80%) of them were free from relapse. But, in the patients with F-medium lymphoma, ADM(+) therapy produced one (17%) CR of 6 patients and their survivals were not superior to those treated with ADM(-) therapy, single agents or radiotherapy alone. There was no difference in the natural history or therapeutic results between the patients in Japan and United States, although the frequency of follicular lymphoma was extremely lower in Japan. ADM(+) therapy can be accepted as the first-line chemotherapy for the patients with F-large lymphoma, but the best modality of treatment should be investigated for the patients with F-medium lymphoma.
