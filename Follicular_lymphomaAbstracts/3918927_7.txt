Three cases of follicular lymphoma in which the follicular center cells exhibited pronounced nuclear irregularities, i.e., convoluted and cerebriform shapes, are described. The cytoplasm in B5-fixed sections was scanty to abundant and showed pale to clear staining, with interlocking cell borders. Although the architectural pattern in these cases suggested B-cell lymphoma, the cytologic features suggested a T-cell phenotype. Immunologic studies of frozen sections by immunohistochemical techniques in all three cases, as well as cell suspension studies in two cases, showed that the follicular center cells, including those with convoluted and cerebriform nuclei, were clearly monoclonal B cells, as evidenced by the presence of only one immunoglobulin light chain on the surfaces. The results of this study suggest that the follicular architectural pattern is a more reliable predictor of the immunologic phenotype than are the cytologic features.
