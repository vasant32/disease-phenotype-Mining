 AIM: To define prognostic significance of B-cell differentiation genes encoding proteins and BCL2 and BCL6 gene abnormalities in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma grade 3 with >75% follicular growth pattern. METHODS: In 53 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and 20 patients with follicular lymphoma grade 3 with >75% follicular growth pattern the following was performed: 1) determination of protein expression of BCL6, CD10, MUM1/IRF4, CD138, and BCL2 by immunohistochemistry; 2) subclassification into germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) and activated B-cell-like (ABC) groups according to the results of protein expression; 3) detection of t(14;18)(q32;q21)/IgH-BCL2 and BCL6 abnormalities by fluorescent in situ hybridization in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma grade 3 with >75% follicular growth pattern as well as in GCB and ABC groups; and 4) assessment of the influence of the analyzed characteristics and clinical prognostic factors on overall survival. RESULTS: Only BCL6 expression was more frequently found in follicular lymphoma grade 3 with >75% follicular growth pattern than in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (P=0.030). There were no differences in BCL2 and BCL6 gene abnormalities between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma grade 3 with >75% follicular growth pattern. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma grade 3 with >75% follicular growth pattern patients were equally distributed in GCB and ABC groups. t(14;18)(q32;q21) was more frequently recorded in GCB group, and t(14;18)(q32;q21) with BCL2 additional signals or only BCL2 and IgH additional signals in ABC group (P=0.004). The GCB and ABC groups showed no difference in BCL6 gene abnormalities. There was no overall survival difference between the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma grade 3 with >75% follicular growth pattern patients, however, GCB group had longer overall survival than ABC group (P=0.047). Multivariate analysis showed that BCL6, CD10, and BCL2 expression, BCL2 and BCL6 abnormalities, and International Prognostic Index were not significantly related to overall survival. CONCLUSION: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma grade 3 with >75% follicular growth pattern patients have very similar characteristics and their prognosis is more influenced by protein expression of B-cell differentiation stage genes than by tumor cells growth pattern, BCL2 and BCL6 abnormalities, and International Prognostic Index.
