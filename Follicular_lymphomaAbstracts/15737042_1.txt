Cytomorphologic testing and multiparameter flow cytometry are the mainstays in diagnosing B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, whereas fluorescence in situ hybridization that targets the translocation t(14;18)(q32;q21) often is used to identify follicular lymphoma. Therapy is highly diverse between both diseases. We describe a case with cytomorphologically and immunologically proven B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia in which t(14;18)(q32;q21) was found.
