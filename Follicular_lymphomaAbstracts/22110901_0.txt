A middle aged man presented with abdominal pain and fever, with progressive dyspnea for the past one week. He had generalized lymphadenopathy with hepatosplenomegaly and a left sided pleural effusion on admission. Further evaluation revealed that he had lymphocytosis on peripheral blood. He then developed increasing abdominal pain and fall in hemoglobin which was confirmed on imaging to be due to a splenic rupture and he underwent a splenectomy. The diagnosis on lymph node biopsy and peripheral blood immunophenotyping was grade 1 follicular lymphoma. He has completed his 6 cycles of chemotherapy (R-CVP) and is on maintenance rituximab and doing well. The case highlights the fact that splenic rupture can even be caused by indolent lymphomas.
