FcgammaRIIB, a low affinity receptor for the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G (IgG), is thought to drive negative selection of B cells in germinal centers (GC) by inducing apoptosis upon interaction with immune complexes. Its expression was investigated by immunohistochemistry in 22 reactive lymphoid tissues and 112 B-cell lymphomas. Pre-GC mantle cells, marginal zone cells and their neoplastic counterparts expressed FcgammaRIIB. The B chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphomas were also positive. Not detected in GC, FcgammaRIIB was expressed in 52% of follicular lymphomas and in 20% of diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL). In DLBCL, FcgammaRIIB expression was linked to transformation (P < 0.001). Re-analysis of a gene profile data set from the Lymphochip microarrays showed that FcgammaRIIB expression in the activated B-like DLBCL subgroup was higher than in the GC-like one (P < 0.04), and was associated with an adverse prognostic both in univariate (P < 0.003) and in multivariate analysis including the International Prognostic Indicator (IPI) (P < 0.01). Thus these results challenge the potential role of FcgammaRIIB during B-cell selection in GC, and suggest a prognostic value of FcgammaRIIB expression in DLBCL.
