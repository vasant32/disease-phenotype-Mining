The p16 (CDKN2a/INK4a) gene is an important tumor-suppressor gene, involved in the p16/cyclin-dependent kinase/retinoblastoma gene pathway of cell cycle control. The p16 protein is considered to be a negative regulator of the pathway. Promoter hypermethylation resulting in inactivation of the p16 gene has been found in various hematopoietic malignancies, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and may play a role in transformation/clinical aggressiveness of those tumors. However, the p16 protein expression in primary gastric lymphoma has not been studied. In this study, we characterize protein expression and promoter hypermethylation of the p16 gene in B-cell primary gastric lymphomas from China. In all, 43 cases of B-cell primary gastric lymphoma were investigated. They consisted of 24 (56%) cases of diffuse large-cell lymphoma, 12 (28%) cases of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma, six (14%) cases of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma with large-cell transformation and one (2%) case of follicular lymphoma. Loss of p16 protein expression was found in 34 (79%) out of 43 cases, while the remaining nine (21%) cases showed positivities for the p16 protein. All 43 cases were further characterized by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to analyze p16 promoter hypermethylation status. In total, 11 (26%) of 43 cases were positive for p16 promoter hypermethylation. Among those, 10 (30%) out of the 33 cases negative for the p16 immunostaining showed promoter hypermethylation, whereas only one (10%) out of the 10 cases that were positive for the p16 immunostaining displayed promoter hypermethylation. Of the 43 cases, 30 had limited pathologic data at the time of resection. Primary gastric lymphoma involved extragastric sites (lymph node or liver) in 17 (57%) of 30 cases, while the remaining 13 (43%) cases were only limited to the stomach. Loss of p16 protein expression was found in 14 (82%) of 17 cases with extragastric involvement and in 11 (85%) of 13 cases without such involvement. In conclusion, loss of p16 protein expression is frequent in those B-cell primary gastric lymphomas and approximately one-third of such loss correlated with promoter hypermethylation. Despite limited pathologic data, loss of p16 protein expression appears not to be correlated with extragastric involvements.
