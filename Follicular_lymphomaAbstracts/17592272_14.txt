Primary testicular lymphomas typically occur in patients over 60 years of age. Most are diffuse large B-cell lymphomas with frequent dissemination and a poor prognosis. Primary follicular lymphoma of the adult testis has not been well characterized. However, a small number of primary testicular follicular lymphomas have recently been described in children. These showed stage 1E disease, a lack of BCL2 gene rearrangement and Bcl-2 protein expression, and a good clinical outcome. Here, we describe 5 cases of primary follicular lymphoma of the testis and epididymis in adults. These presented as unilateral testicular masses 12 to 40 mm in diameter and were characterized histologically by small neoplastic follicles in a sclerotic background. The neoplastic cells expressed CD10 and Bcl-6, but not Bcl-2 and lacked t(14;18)(q32;q21)/IGH-BCL2 and BCL6 gene rearrangements. Four of the five patients were 35 years old or younger, and 4 presented with stage 1EA disease. Although follow-up is 12 months or less in 2 of the 5 patients, to date each has followed an indolent clinical course. These features are different from those of most adult nodal follicular lymphomas but are very similar to those of the pediatric primary testicular follicular lymphomas. Together, the pediatric and adult cases represent a discrete clinicopathologic entity of t(14;18)(q32;q21)/IGH-BCL2-negative primary follicular lymphoma of the testis and epididymis, which typically present as clinically indolent localized disease in young males and should be distinguished from the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma more frequently seen in the testes of older adults.
