A study of histopathological and clinical features of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 495 consecutive cases, diagnosed at AFIP during 1984-1989 is presented. Children below the age of 15 years were not included in this study. The relative frequency of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was 4.29% in our material. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was more frequent than Hodgkin's disease, ratio being 2.44:1. Lymphadenopathy (78.78%), fever (33.08%), weight loss (31.62%) and anemia (30.14%) were the main presenting features. New working formulation was used for morphological characterisation. Follicular lymphoma constituted 8.08% of all cases. Follicular lymphoma was seen only in older age whereas diffuse lymphoma occurred in all age groups. Intermediate and high grade lymphoma represented 73.54% of all NHL. Small lymphocytic lymphoma was common in low grade tumours (13.13%). Extra nodal lymphoma was encountered in a significant proportion (21.22%), gastrointestinal tract being the most frequent site. This study outlines certain interesting features of NHL in Pakistan.
