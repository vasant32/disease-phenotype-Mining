Eight patients with various hematological malignancies were treated with chlorambucil, an analogue of nitrogen mustard. Five patients with CLL, 2 patients with malignant lymphoma, and one each with pseudolymphoma of the lung and primary macroglobulinemia were given 4-6 mg of chlorambucil per day for 1-2 weeks at 2-4 week intervals or a daily dose of 6 mg continuously. Two cases of CLL and one each of follicular lymphoma and pseudolymphoma achieved partial remission. Side effects included myelosuppression, especially leukopenia. Chlorambucil can be used orally without severe toxicity for longer periods and the major indication for this drug seems to be CLL and favorable type of malignant lymphoma.
