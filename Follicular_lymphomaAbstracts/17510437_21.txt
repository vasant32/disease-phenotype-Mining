Two common single nucleotide polymorphisms in immunoregulatory genes (TNF G308A, rs1800629 and IL10 T3575A, rs1800890) have been recently reported as risk factors for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in a large pooled analysis. We systematically investigated the effects of other established NHL risk factors in relation to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) G308A or interleukin 10 (IL10) T3575A genotypes. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) from 1,172 cases and 982 population-based controls in a U.S. multicenter study. We investigated NHL overall and two common subtypes [diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma]. NHL risks were increased among those with both an autoimmune condition and the TNF G308A GA/AA (OR(NHL), 2.1; 95% CI, 1.0-4.2) or the IL10 T3575A TA/AA genotype (OR(NHL), 1.6; 95% CI, 0.9-2.6) compared with individuals without an autoimmune condition and with the common TNF G308A GG or IL10 T3575A TT genotype, respectively; results were similar for DLBCL and follicular lymphoma. We found that elevated DLBCL risk associated with last-born status was more pronounced among those with TNF G308A GA/AA (OR(DLBCL), 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1-6.4) or IL10 T3575A TA/AA (OR(DLBCL), 2.9; 95% CI, 1.6-5.2). Similarly, elevated DLBCL risk associated with obesity (body mass index, > or = 35 versus <25 kg/m(2)) was observed only among those with TNF G308A GA/AA (OR(DLBCL), 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1-5.7) or IL10 T3575A TA/AA genotypes (OR(DLBCL), 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.5). These exploratory results require replication but provide evidence that autoimmune conditions, late birth order, and obesity act partly through a common inflammatory pathway, posing a greater risk to individuals with variant TNF and IL10 genotypes than those with wild-type alleles.
