In follicular lymphoma, nonmalignant immune cells are important. Follicular lymphoma depends on CD4+ cells, but CD8+ cells counteract it. We hypothesized that the presence of follicular lymphoma is associated with higher CD4+ than CD8+ cell numbers in the tumor microenvironment but not in the immune system. Using flow cytometry, pre-treatment and follow-up CD4/CD8 ratios were estimated in the bone marrow, blood and lymph nodes of untreated follicular lymphoma patients in two independent data sets (N(1)=121; N(2)=166). The ratios were analyzed for their relation with bone marrow lymphoma involvement. Bone marrows were also investigated with immunohistochemistry. In either data set, the bone marrow CD4/CD8 ratios were higher in bone marrows involved with lymphoma (P=0.043 and 0.0002, respectively). The mean CD4/CD8 ratio was 1.0 in uninvolved and 1.4 in involved bone marrows. Also higher in involved bone marrows were CD4/CD56 and CD3CD25/CD3 ratios. No blood or lymph node ratios differed between bone marrow-negative and -positive patients. Sequential samples showed increased bone marrow CD4/CD8 ratios in all cases of progression to bone marrow involvement. Immunohistochemistry showed CD4+, CD57+, programmed death-1+, forkhead box protein 3+ and CD21+ cells accumulated inside the lymphoma infiltrates, whereas CD8+, CD56+ and CD68+ cells were outside the infiltrates. This study provides evidence in vivo that the microenvironment changes upon follicular lymphoma involvement.
