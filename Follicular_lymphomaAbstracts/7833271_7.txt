Cytogenetics, Southern blotting and PCR were used to detect t(14;18) in 72 British patients with follicular lymphoma. The overall incidence of the translocation was 76%. Cytogenetics was the most successful technique, but 10-30% of translocations detected karyotypically were missed by molecular methods, presumably due to break-points falling outside the range of probes and primers used here. Reliance on molecular detection alone may considerably underestimate the incidence of t(14;18) and it is therefore essential to use the most comprehensive range of probes and primers available.
