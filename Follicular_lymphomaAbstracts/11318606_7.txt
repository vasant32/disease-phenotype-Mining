Translocation of the BCL2 gene from chromosome 18 to chromosome 14 results in constitutive expression of the gene. We have recently demonstrated that the major breakpoint region (mbr) of BCL2, which is implicated in 70% of t(14;18) translocations present in human follicular lymphoma, is a matrix attachment region. Since these regions are implicated in control of both transcription and replication, we wished to determine whether BCL2 translocation was also accompanied by changes in replication timing of the translocated allele. Using both fluorescence in situ hybridization and allele-specific PCR, we have demonstrated that the translocated allele replicates at the G1/S boundary, while the wildtype allele continues to replicate as usual in mid-S phase. These differences are accompanied by allele-specific changes in BCL2 expression. Since the net structural effect of t(14;18) translocations within the mbr is to disrupt the BCL2 MAR and replace it with the IGH MARs located just downstream of each breakpoint, we conclude that MAR exchange is a significant, selectable outcome of these translocations. We propose that subsequent changes of replication and transcriptional patterns for the translocated BCL2 allele result from this exchange and represent important early steps in lymphomagenesis.
