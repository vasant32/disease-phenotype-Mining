Intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies were found in a case of follicular large cell lymphoma. They did not react with anti-immunoglobulin antisera and showed no enzyme reactivity. On electron microscopy the inclusions consisted of loosely packed fibrillar material not surrounded by a membrane or by rough endoplasmic reticulum. They were found only in the large lymphomatous cells. Immunocytochemistry showed a reactivity of these cells with anti-HLA-Dr and the OKT10 monoclonal antibodies. The nature of the inclusions remains unknown. They differ significantly from those described in the literature in cases of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.
