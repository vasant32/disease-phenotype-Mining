 PURPOSE: In a phase II trial we investigated fludarabine phosphate (FAMP) as therapy for patients with relapsed lymphoma to determine its effectiveness and toxicity in this disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The 67 assessable patients had a median age of 56 years and had received a median of three chemotherapy regimens before treatment with FAMP. The starting dose was 25 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 30 minutes daily for 5 days every 3 to 4 weeks. RESULTS: High response rates were observed for follicular small cleaved-cell lymphoma (FSCCL) (62%), follicular mixed small- and large-cell lymphoma (80%), and follicular large-cell lymphoma (FLCL) (100%). Responses also occurred in small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) (33%), transformed lymphoma (33%), mycosis fungoides (40%), and Hodgkin's disease (25%). No responses were observed in other intermediate- or high-grade lymphomas (N = 20). Overall, there were five patients with a complete response, 23 patients with a partial response, and an overall response rate of 37%. Toxicity was primarily hematologic and infectious. No significant gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, or neurologic toxicity occurred. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that FAMP has major activity in follicular lymphoma. Fundamental research is needed to understand this differential efficacy in low-grade lymphoma yet lack of efficacy in intermediate- and high-grade lymphoma. Clinical investigations should be done using FAMP in varying dose schedules and in combination regimens.
