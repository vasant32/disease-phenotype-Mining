The past decade has seen improvements in overall survival (OS) for patients with the two most common lymphoma histologies: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL). In FL, at least four independent datasets have confirmed these survival improvements. The monoclonal antibody rituximab has significantly contributed to these improved therapeutic outcomes. This issue will explore the impact of monoclonal antibody therapy on outcome in indolent lymphoma, and detail how this improved outcome has changed clinical practice. Furthermore, the role of monoclonal antibodies in maintenance regimens and the main indications for radiolabeled antibodies will be discussed in detail. Finally, possible future developments in the field will be proposed, including the use of monoclonal antibodies in ablative transplantation and in the treatment of leukemias.
