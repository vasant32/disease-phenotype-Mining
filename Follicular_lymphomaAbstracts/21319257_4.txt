In B-cell malignancies, genes implicated in B-cell differentiation, germinal center formation, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation are juxtaposed to immunoglobulin loci through chromosomal translocations. In this study, we identified the BTB and CNC homology 2 (BACH2) gene as a novel translocation partner of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) locus in a patient with IGH-MYC-positive, highly aggressive B-cell lymphoma/leukemia carrying der(14)t(8;14) and del(6)(q15). Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis using an IGH/MYC probe detected an IGH-MYC fusion signal on der(14) and IGH signal on del(6). Genome copy number analysis showed a deletion in the 6q15-25 region and a centromeric breakpoint within the BACH2 gene. cDNA bubble polymerase chain reaction using BACH2 primers revealed that the first exon of Cδ was fused to the 5'-untranslated region of BACH2 exon 2. The Cδ-BACH2 fusion transcript consisted of exon 1 of Cδ and exons 2 to 9 of BACH2, encompassing the entire BACH2 coding region, and the BACH2 was highly expressed in this patient. These results indicate that Cδ-BACH2 fusion may cause constitutive activation of BACH2. Although additional screening of 47 samples of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) patients and 29 cell lines derived from B-cell malignancies by double-color fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis detected a split signal with deletion of centromeric region of BACH2 only in a patient with follicular lymphoma, BACH2 was highly expressed in lymphoma cells of the patient and B-NHL cell lines with IGH-MYC translocation. These findings suggest that BACH2 plays a critical role in B-cell lymphomagenesis, especially related to IGH-MYC translocation in some way.
