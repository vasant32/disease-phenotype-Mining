 BACKGROUND AND AIM: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been postulated to be an etiological agent for lymphoid malignancies. Whereas a high prevalence of HCV infection in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients has been shown to exist in many geographical areas of high HCV prevalence, studies from other parts have not established any form of association. In India, there is a scarcity of data to show either a positive or a negative association between NHL and HCV infection. Therefore, we determined the prevalence of HCV infection in patients with NHL. METHODS: A total of 228 subjects were included, out of which, the number of newly diagnosed consecutive patients with lymphoproliferative disorders (NHL and CLL) were 57 [mean age, 48.7 years (range: 18-80)] and the control group consisted of 171 subjects [mean age, 48.6 years (range: 18-80)]. We used third generation enzyme immunoassay to detect HCV antibodies. HCV RNA was detected by nested RT-PCR. RESULTS: Among the 57 patients of NHL, 44 (77.2%) had high-grade disease (diffuse large B cell), 6 (10.5%) intermediate-grade (follicular lymphoma), and 7 (12.3%) low-grade (small lymphocytic); 26 patients had B symptoms at diagnosis. None of the patient tested positive for antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) while 1 patient (1.75%) tested positive for HCV RNA. Among the age- and sex- matched controls, 2 (1.17%) subjects tested positive for anti-HCV; both were also positive for HCV RNA. CONCLUSIONS: HCV infection is unlikely to be associated with lymphoproliferative disorders in northern India and does not play a major role in the pathogenesis of lymphoproliferative disorders.
