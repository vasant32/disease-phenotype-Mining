Due to advances in double-balloon endoscopy, various types of malignant lymphoma of the small intestine have been observed at very early stages. We report here that after remission of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma recurred in the mucosa of the small intestine. Furthermore, these lesions were diagnosed by biopsy from normal mucosa as diminutive erosions and reddish looking. If a small intestinal lesion is suspected of being a malignant lymphoma, a double-balloon endoscopy should be carried out, and a biopsy should be taken and inspected.
