 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To share the recent progress in research and new therapies against follicular lymphoma and highlight the exciting opportunities to improve the treatment of follicular lymphoma. RECENT FINDINGS: Follicular lymphoma has been somewhat neglected by the research community, but recent genomic studies have identified key genetic lesions in follicular lymphoma. In addition, a new murine model is available to explore the function of these lesions in the development, progression, and treatment of follicular lymphoma. Moreover, new small-molecule inhibitors are now available that target key pathways in follicular lymphoma including B-cell receptor signaling and histone modifiers. SUMMARY: Follicular lymphoma is a very common and still incurable form of lymphoma. However, recent genomic and in-vivo biological studies are beginning to unveil the molecular drivers of follicular lymphoma. This coincides with the development of effective small-molecule inhibitors against key targets. Together these developments suggest that we are at a long overdue watershed moment in the treatment of follicular lymphoma.
