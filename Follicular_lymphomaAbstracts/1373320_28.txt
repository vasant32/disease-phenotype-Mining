A distinct subtype of extranodal malignant lymphoma derived from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT) has recently been defined. We have detected an acquired t(11;18)(q21;q21.1) in a patient with a MALT lymphoma of the stomach. This translocation has previously been described in two other patients with extranodal lymphoma. The BCL2 oncogene, which is located at band 18q21.3 and is activated by the t(14;18)(q32;q21) in follicular lymphoma, was not rearranged in this case. This newly identified t(11;18) may be a recurring translocation specifically associated with MALT lymphomas. Genes located at the breakpoint sites of chromosome 11 and/or chromosome 18 may be crucial to the pathogenesis of this type of malignant lymphoma.
