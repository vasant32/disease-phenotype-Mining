Patients with advanced follicular lymphoma (FL) have numerous treatment options, including observation, radiotherapy, single-agent or combination chemotherapy, mAbs, and radioimmunoconjugates. These therapies can extend progression-free survival but none can provide a cure. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remains the only curable therapy for FL, with the field shifting more toward the use of reduced-intensity conditioning regimens because of the lower associated nonrelapse mortality compared with myeloablative regimens. However, GVHD and infection are still problematic in the allo-HSCT population. Autologous HSCT (auto-HSCT) confers high response rates and prolongs progression-free survival in relapsed patients who are chemosensitive, and an increasing amount of data suggest that auto-HSCT may be curative if offered to relapsed patients who are not heavily pretreated. Auto-HSCT has no role as consolidation therapy for patients in first remission based on the results from 3 large randomized trials. Novel conditioning regimens with radioimmunoconjugates have been used in both auto-HSCT and allo-HSCT regimens and results have shown efficacy even in chemorefractory patients. Therefore, with the exception of patients in first remission, the optimal timing for HSCT remains controversial. However, the outcomes seen after auto-HSCT and allo-HSCT continue to improve, and HSCT represents a treatment modality that should be considered in all FL patients, especially while their disease remains chemoresponsive.
