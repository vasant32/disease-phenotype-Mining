 PURPOSE: Approximately one third of non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) arise in tissues other than the lymph nodes. The purposes of this study are to evaluate the clinical outcome of NHLs of the oral cavity and maxillofacial region in a group of 58 patients who were diagnosed in our clinic and to discuss the clinical, histologic, and immunohistochemical features of these malignant neoplasms, as well as the prognosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 58 patients with extranodal NHLs of the oral cavity and maxillofacial region. There were 32 male and 26 female patients. The patients' ages ranged from 7 to 81 years. The most frequent sites of occurrence were the salivary glands (24 patients) and intraoral mucosa (21 patients). Other sites were the paranasal sinus (3 patients), Waldeyer ring (4 patients), bone of the jaws (3 patients), and orbit (3 patients). The histologic subtype was extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) in 21 patients, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in 19, chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 10, mantle cell lymphoma in 4, follicular lymphoma in 2, Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia in 1, and B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) in 1. Of the DLBCL cases, 13 were stage IIE and 6 were stage IE. All the MALT lymphomas were stage IE. RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 5 years after the initial diagnosis. A better prognosis was found in patients with MALT lymphomas (19 of 21 patients are alive) compared with those with DLBCLs (10 of 19 patients are alive). CONCLUSIONS: MALT lymphomas have a more favorable outcome (about 90%) in comparison with DLBCLs. Careful examination of the oral cavity and neck by the maxillofacial surgeon is essential for the diagnosis and staging of lymphomas.
