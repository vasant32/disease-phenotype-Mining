CD40 and its ligand, CD154, are major costimulatory molecules whose interactions are important in humoral and cellular immunity. We hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TNFRSF5 and TNFSF5 encoding the CD40 and CD154 proteins, respectively, influence lymphoma risk, particularly a functional TNFRSF5 SNP (-1C>T, rs1883832) associated with reduced B-cell CD40 expression. TNFRSF5 and TNFSF5 SNPs were examined in a population-based case-control study of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (376 cases/801 controls with DNA), and compelling findings were followed up in 2 independent populations. Pooled analyses of all 3 case-control studies (total N = 1776 non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases, N = 2482 controls) revealed an increased risk of follicular lymphoma (FL) associated with the TNFRSF5 -1TT genotype (odds ratio = 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.4). In addition, among women, an inverse association was found between the variant A allele for a TNFSF5 6809G>A SNP and FL risk (OR = .61; 95% CI, 0.36-0.98). In genotype-phenotype studies, significantly reduced circulating soluble CD40 was observed in TNFRSF5 -1TT compared with -1CC carriers. Further, dendritic cells from those with -1TT versus -1CC genotypes exhibited lower CD40 cell surface expression. These results suggest that the TNFRSF5 -1C>T polymorphism may increase FL susceptibility through mechanisms that hinder cellular immune responses. Further studies are needed to explore these findings.
