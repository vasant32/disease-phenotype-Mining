A previously healthy 47-year-old woman was treated for follicular lymphoma, grade III, with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, prednisone with rituximab (CHOP-R) followed by ibritumomab tiuxetan and rituximab. She developed a serum sickness-like illness during immunotherapy with fever, myalgias, arthralgias, and pleural and pericardial effusions. Despite anti-inflammatory therapies her symptoms persisted for 10 months before ultimate resolution. Her clinical course and literature are reviewed.
