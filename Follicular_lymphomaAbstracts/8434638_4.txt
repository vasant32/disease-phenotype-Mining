We examined 81 cases of Hodgkin's disease for evidence of the t(14;18) translocation, using the polymerase chain reaction assay on lysates of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. Seven of 74 amplifiable cases (9%) were positive for the translocation, which involves the bcl-2 oncogene and the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene. Two of these cases were sequenced and the breakpoints had the same pattern found in follicular lymphoma. The nuclei from one of the cases were sorted into large and small subpopulations. The t(14;18) signal was more intense in the large nucleus subpopulation, which contained a greater proportion of Reed-Sternberg-like nuclei. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that Reed-Sternberg cells carry the translocation, but they do not exclude the possibility that the translocation is found in cells representing the reactive component of Hodgkin's disease. The results also demonstrate that routinely processed material is suitable for polymerase chain reaction-based analysis of translocations, although the sensitivity is reduced 10- to 100-fold, compared with fresh tissue.
