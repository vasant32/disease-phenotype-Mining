PURPOSE: Unlike nodal follicular lymphoma (NFL), Primary cutaneous follicular lymphomas (PCFLs) rarely express Bcl-2 protein or t(14;18)(q32;q21) (Bcl-2/IgH). The aim of this study was to further characterize PCFL in a large series from North America. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical data and archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue were obtained from 32 patients. PCFL was defined as follicular lymphoma limited to the skin at the time of diagnosis and within the first 6 months after diagnosis. Specimens were analyzed for the expression of CD3, CD10, CD20, Bcl-2, and Bcl-6 proteins by immunohistochemistry as well as for the presence of t(14;18)(q32;q21) by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The male-to-female ratio was 1.5:1, with a median age of 60 years. Twenty-four patients had lesions on the head and neck, five had lesions on the trunk, and three had lesions on both head and trunk. Follow-up data were available in all cases, with a mean length of 35.8 months. The majority of the patients were treated with radiation therapy. All patients were alive at last follow-up except one. Recurrence was noted in seven patients (22%), after a mean disease-free survival time of 17.7 months. CD10 and Bcl-6 expression were seen in 29 (91%) of 32 and 31 (97%) of 32 cases, respectively. Bcl-2 expression was noted in 13 (41%) of 32 cases. PCR results for t(14;18)(q32;q21) were positive in 11 (34%) of 32 patients and showed correlation with Bcl-2 protein expression. The sequencing of the t(14;18)(q32;q21) amplicons confirmed unique breakpoints in each of the seven tested cases. Comparison between the Bcl-2 and/or t(14;18)(q32;q21)-positive and t(14;18)(q32;q21)-negative cases revealed no significant difference in age, site, clinical course, or outcome. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated Bcl-2 protein expression and t(14;18)(q32;q21) in a significant minority of cases, suggesting a relationship with NFL. It remains to be seen whether, on longer follow-up, there is any clinical difference in cases with and without t(14;18)(q32;q21).
