The immunoglobulin receptor of B-cell lymphomas constitutes a specific tumor antigen (idiotype) and a target for active immunotherapy. Encouraging results have been reported in phase II trials after s.c. vaccination of follicular lymphoma patients during clinical remission with idiotype produced from eukaryotic cell lines and coupled to an immunogenic carrier macromolecule. We have developed a good manufacturing protocol for rapid expression of idiotype vaccines as recombinant Fab fragments in Escherichia coli. The objectives of this trial were to show safety and feasibility of intradermal immunization with this vaccine and to investigate whether immune responses were induced by this immunization route. Patients (n = 18) with advanced B-cell malignancies received repetitive intradermal vaccinations with 0.5 to 1.65 mg recombinant idiotype Fab fragment mixed with lipid-based adjuvant in combination with 150 mug granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor s.c. at the same location. The patients' immune status was assessed by flow cytometry of peripheral blood lymphocytes and concomitant hepatitis B vaccination. Cellular and humoral immune responses to the vaccine were assessed by enzyme-linked immunospot and ELISA. Side effects of a total of 65 vaccinations were mild and did not affect the immunization schedule. No patient developed hepatitis B surface antibodies (anti-HBs) after two hepatitis B immunizations. Of 17 evaluable patients, five developed specific anti-vaccine antibodies, and eight developed anti-Fab T-cell responses. T-cell reactivity was independent of the cellular immune status and was idiotype specific as shown by statistical regression analysis (P = 0.0024) and epitope mapping studies. Intradermal administration of uncoupled recombinant idiotype with appropriate adjuvants may overcome profound clinical immunosuppression and induce specific immune responses.
