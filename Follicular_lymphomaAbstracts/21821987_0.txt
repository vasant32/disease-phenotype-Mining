We report here rare cases of discordant lymphoma consisting of MALT lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. Case 1: A 53-year-old woman was diagnosed with MALT lymphoma of the left parotid gland and follicular lymphoma of the duodenum and small intestine. Case 2: A 38-year-old woman was diagnosed with MALT lymphoma of the intestine and follicular lymphoma of the duodenum and bone marrow. Recently, it has been suggested that duodenal follicular lymphoma has intermediate characteristics of nodal follicular lymphoma and MALT lymphoma. It is interesting that both of these cases demonstrated duodenal follicular lymphoma. These cases suggest that MALT lymphoma and duodenal follicular lymphoma share some common pathological condition.
