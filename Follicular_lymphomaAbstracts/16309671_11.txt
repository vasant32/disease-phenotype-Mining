Glucocorticoids are commonly used in the treatment of various lymphoid malignancies. In the present study, we show that dexamethasone (Dex) induced depolarization of mitochondrial membrane, release of cytochrome c and DNA fragmentation in a human follicular lymphoma cell line, HF28RA. New protein synthesis was required before Dex-induced mitochondrial changes, and the kinetics of the apoptotic events correlated with the upregulation of the Bim protein. Furthermore, we studied whether specific inhibitors of known survival pathways would potentiate Dex-induced apoptosis. Our results show that inhibition of PKC and ERK pathways had no effect on apoptosis. In contrast, inhibition of PI3-kinase or Akt markedly enhanced Dex-induced apoptosis. The enhancement was seen at the mitochondrial level, and the kinetics of apoptosis was notably accelerated. In addition, inhibition of PI3-kinase did not alter levels of Bax, Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L) or Bim proteins in mitochondria but caused translocation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bad to mitochondria. However, inhibition of PI3-kinase-Akt pathway and subsequent translocation of Bad to mitochondria did not induce apoptosis itself. Based on these results and our current understanding of Bim and Bad action, it seems that both proteins play a synergistic role in this process. Thus, these results indicate that inhibitors of PI3-kinase-Akt pathway might be combined in future with glucocorticoids to improve the treatment of lymphoid malignancies.
