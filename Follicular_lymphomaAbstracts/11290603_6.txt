BCL-6 is essential for germinal center formation and thus for affinity maturation of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes by somatic mutations. The 5'-noncoding region of the BCL-6 gene is even a target for the mutation machinery. Translocations of the BCL-6 gene to heterologous promoters and mutations of its 5'-noncoding regulatory region were reported to be potential mechanisms for deregulating BCL-6 expression and for playing a role in the genesis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In line with this hypothesis is the observation that B-cell lymphoma with somatic mutations, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma, also carry BCL-6 mutations, some of which are recurrently detectable. Classic Hodgkin disease (cHD) is also derived from B cells with high loads of somatic mutations and thus a further candidate for BCL-6 mutations. To determine the presence and potential role of BCL-6 mutations in cHD, the 5'-noncoding BCL-6 proportion of single Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells from 6 cases of cHD and 6 cases of HD-derived cell lines was analyzed. All B-cell-derived HD cases and cell lines harbored BCL-6 mutations. In contrast, both T-cell-derived HD cases and cell lines were devoid of BCL-6 mutations. With only one exception, there were no lymphoma-specific recurrent BCL-6 mutations detected, and BCL-6 protein was absent from the HRS cells of most cases. In conclusion, (1) somatic BCL-6 mutations are restricted to cHD cases of B-cell origin, and (2) the BCL-6 mutations represent mostly irrelevant somatic base substitutions without consequences for BCL-6 protein expression and the pathogenesis of cHD.
