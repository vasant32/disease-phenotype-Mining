The prognostic value of grading follicular lymphoma has been debated since the 1980s. There is consensus that World Health Organization (WHO) grades 1 and 2 are indolent, but not whether grades 3A or 3B are aggressive. We retrospectively reviewed the follicular lymphoma diagnoses according to the 2008 WHO classification in all diagnostic specimens from a population-based cohort of 505 patients with a median follow-up time of 10·0years (range, 4·6-16·0). After excluding 43 patients with concomitant diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 345 remained with grade 1-2, 94 with grade 3A, and 23 with grade 3B follicular lymphoma. Grades 1-2 and 3A seemed equally indolent, with indistinguishable clinical courses, even in patients receiving anthracyclines. Compared with grades 1-3A and independently of clinical factors, grade 3B correlated with higher mortality (P=0·008), but outcome was improved after upfront anthracycline-containing therapy (P=0·015). In contrast to grade 1-3A patients, grade 3B patients experienced no relapses or deaths beyond 5years of follow-up. Furthermore, patients with grade 3B were predominantly male and seldom presented with bone-marrow involvement. We conclude that follicular lymphoma grade 1-3A is indolent and incurable with conventional therapy. Grade 3B appears to be an aggressive but curable disease.
