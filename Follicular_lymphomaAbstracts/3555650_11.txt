One hundred eight consecutive patients with indolent lymphoproliferative diseases were stratified into chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), stage III and IV well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma (WDLL), and stage III and IV follicular lymphoma (FL). Within each stratum, patients were prospectively and randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy with chlorambucil and prednisone (CP) or fractionated total body irradiation (TBI). Morbidity from both regimens was negligible. Complete response (CR) was defined as the resolution of organ enlargement and the return of blood count to normal. The CR rate for the entire CP group (n = 54) was 59% and that for the TBI group (n = 54), 52%; median survivals were 53 and 57 months respectively. In the 41 patients with CLL the CR rate for CP (n = 17) was 47% and that for TBI (n = 24), 50%; the median survival for CP was 48 months, and for TBI it was 51 months. In the 21 patients with WDLL the CR rate for CP (n = 15) was 53% and that for TBI (n = 6), 67%; the median survival for CP was 42 months and has not yet been reached for TBI. For the 46 patients with FL the CR rate for CP (n = 22) was 72% and that for TBI (n = 24), 50%; the median survival was 55 months, and for TBI it was 56 months. None of the differences in CR or survival are statistically significant (P greater than .05). In these indolent lymphoproliferative diseases, CP and TBI are equally effective forms of initial treatment irrespective of the end point being defined as CR or survival.
