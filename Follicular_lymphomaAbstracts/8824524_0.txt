We report 30 hematologic malignancies arising in 25 of 236 Syrian golden hamsters (SGH) that received combinations of N-nitrobis(2-oxopropyl)amine (BOP) and Streptozotocin (STZ). Lesions developed with morphological similarity to human small lymphocytic (n = 7), diffuse mixed (n = 2), diffuse large cell lymphoma (n = 13), follicular lymphoma (n = 2), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (n = 3), hairy cell leukemia (n = 2), malignant histiocytosis (n = 1) and discordant lymphomas (n = 5). The types and distribution of these lesions are different from epizootic lymphomas in SGH. We also report a higher percentage (12 versus 4.6%) and the earlier appearance (< or = 40 versus 80-112 weeks) compared with aging-associated spontaneous SGH lymphoma. The features of these hematologic malignancies have not been previously reported in epizootic or aging-associated spontaneous lymphomas and therefore suggest a new class of hematologic lesions in SGH. Benign and atypical hyperplasia correlated with STZ administration (r = 0.97, P = 0.03). The malignant lesions correlated with areas of lymphoid hyperplasia (r = 0.78, P= 0.004). Only one of the 21 untreated SGH spontaneously developed a low grade lymphoma. The unusual types, distribution and occurrence of these lesions may suggest a role for these carcinogens in their induction.
