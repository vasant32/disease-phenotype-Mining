Clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical features in 39 cases of primary intestinal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in Japanese patients were studied. Only resection materials in state IE and IIE-1 were included in this study because of the certainty that the intestine was the primary site of the lymphoma. The updated Kiel classification was used to classify NHL. Histologically, only two cases (5.1%) were follicular lymphomas, and the others were diffuse lymphomas. Twenty-eight patients (71.8%) had high-grade NHL and 11 (28.2%) had low-grade NHL. Twenty (71.4%) of the 28 high-grade NHL were centroblastic lymphomas, and 14 (70.0%) of these 20 cases of centroblastic lymphoma were the polymorphic variant. Ten (90.9%) of the 11 low-grade NHL were low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. Macroscopically, 18 patients had polypoid masses, 17 ulcerative tumors and four had diffusely infiltrating NHL. Seven of the 10 low-grade MALT lymphomas were polypoid masses. Immunohistochemically, 35 lesions (89.7%) were of the B cell phenotype and three (7.7%) were of the T cell phenotype. In the remaining case, the cell lineage could not be determined. No lesions were considered to be of histiocytic origin. The 5 year survival rate for high-grade B cell lymphomas was poorer than for low-grade B cell lymphomas, and the present study indicated that the histological grade of the intestinal B cell lymphomas was a prognostically significant factor.
