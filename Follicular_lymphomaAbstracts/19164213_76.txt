 PURPOSE: The antiepidermal growth factor receptor antibody cetuximab shows activity in irinotecan-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), mainly in wild-type KRAS tumors. Cetuximab may also exert antitumor effects through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in which antibody Fc portion interacts with Fc receptors (FcgammaRs) expressed by immune cells. ADCC is influenced by FcgammaRIIa-H131R and FcgammaRIIIa-V158F polymorphisms that are clinically relevant in follicular lymphoma and metastatic breast cancer treated with rituximab and trastuzumab, respectively. We investigated the association of FcgammaR polymorphisms and KRAS mutation with the outcome of irinotecan-refractory mCRC patients treated with cetuximab plus irinotecan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tumor and normal tissues from 69 patients were screened for KRAS mutations using a sensitive multiplex assay and genotyped for FcgammaRIIa and FcgammaRIIIa polymorphisms by direct sequencing and multiplex allele-specific polymerase chain reaction, respectively. The results were correlated with response and progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: KRAS mutations were associated with lower response rate (4% v 27% in nonmutated patients; P = .021) and shorter PFS (3.0 v 5.3 months; P = .021). Patients with FcgammaRIIa-131H/H and/or FcgammaIIIa-158V/V genotypes had longer PFS than 131R and 158F carriers (5.5 v 3.0 months; P = .005). The difference remained significant for mutated-KRAS patients. By multivariate analysis, KRAS mutation and FcgammaR combined status were independent risk factors for PFS. CONCLUSION: Combined FcgammaRIIa/FcgammaRIIIa polymorphisms are prognostic factors for disease progression in mCRC patients treated with cetuximab plus irinotecan. As these polymorphisms are also clinically relevant in mutated-KRAS mCRC, an important role of ADCC in cetuximab efficacy is presumed.
