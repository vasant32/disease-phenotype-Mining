 BACKGROUND: Multiple neoplasms in a patient occur rarely. There has only been one case report about synchronous endometrial carcinoma and follicular lymphoma of the paraaortic and pelvic lymph node (LN) until now. CASE REPORT: The patient was 64 years old and had vaginal spotting for four months. She was diagnosed with endometrioid endometrial carcinoma by endometrial biopsy. In intraoperative inspection, the whole paraaortic and pelvic LN had formed into a massive tumor bundle following the aorta and iliac vessels. The diagnosis was endometrial carcinoma FIGO Stage IB with synchronous follicular lymphoma Stage III. We performed adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Currently, the patient has no evidence of recurrence for either carcinoma. CONCLUSION: Lymph node dissection was included in the staging and debulking operation of the endometrial carcinoma. An inaccurate result of the frozen section can not rule out metastasis of endometrial carcinoma and surgeons can fall into a dilemma regarding treatment.
