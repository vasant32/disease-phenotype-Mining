 UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND; Many investigators account that a stomach is the most often localization of gastrointestinal lymphomas. But endoscopic semiotics and diagnostic of those lesions is elaborated insufficiently. PURPOSE: The purpose of our investigation was working out of non-Hodgkin's gastric lymphoma endoscopic criteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examinated 250 patients with gastric lymphoma, from those primary and secondary lesions were in 160 (64%) cases and 90 (36%) cases, respectively. All patients was performed standard videoendoscopy, which included magnified endoscopy with NBI (Narrow Band Imaging), followed by chromoendoscopy with indigocarmine (0.4% solution) and EUS. Diagnosis of lymphoma was confirmed by morphology and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: According to our observations gastroenterological pathology duration to diagnosis of tumor was very variable: diagnosis was established during first 3 months in 30.6% cases (49 patients), during 6 month in 18.1% cases (29 patients), from 6 to 12 months in 15.6% cases (25 patients). Separately should was noted, that almost in one third cases primary gastric lymphoma was diagnosed after one year. Macroscopic form of gastric tumor was represented by follow variants: exophytic--22 cases (8.8%), infiltrative--54 cases (21.6%), ulcerous--37 cases (14.8%), infiltrative-ulcerous--71 cases (28.4%), similar to gastritis--36 cases (14.4%), mixed--30 cases (12%). The second endpoint of our work was detection of macroscopic features depending on morphological variant of lymphoma. Analysis of represented data demonstrated prevalence similar to gastritis form (33.4%) for MALT-lymphoma, infiltrative-ulcerous form as for diffuse large-cell B-cell lymphoma of MALT-type, as for diffuse large-cell B-cell lymphoma--45.0% and 41.1%, respectively. Infiltrative form was more often in group of patients with follicular lymphoma--31.8%, and ulcerous form predominated for Burkett's lymphoma--60.0%. CONCLUSION; Were established the most informative endoscopic criteria for diagnosis non-Hodgkin's gastric lymphoma.
