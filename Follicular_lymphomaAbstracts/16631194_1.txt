Active immunization of follicular lymphoma patients with idiotypic vaccines elicits antigen-specific antibody responses, T-cell responses, and antitumor effects. We hypothesized that these vaccinated patients could generate tumor-specific immune responses, not only against idiotype, but also against other tumor-associated antigens (TAA) by a mechanism of epitope spreading. To identify potential antigens, a phage surface expressed cDNA library derived from primary tumor cells was screened with sera from idiotype-vaccinated patients. Consistent with our hypothesis, we identified two immunogenic peptides (FL-aa-7 and 18), unrelated to idiotype, which were recognized by postvaccine sera but not by prevaccine or normal human sera. These peptide sequences derived from the 5'-untranslated regions of the human GTPase, IMAP family member 7 gene (FL-aa-7) and an alternative reading frame of U1-snRNP 70 (FL-aa-18), respectively, suggesting that epitope spreading had occurred.
