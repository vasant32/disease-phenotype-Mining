 PURPOSE: The role of molecular monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) in low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is controversial. We have performed a prospective study of the molecular behavior of 35 patients with follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who received cyclophosphamide-vincristine-prednisone chemotherapy in conjunction with IFN-alpha 2b. Experimental Design: Bcl-2 and clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangements were assayed at diagnosis by PCR in lymph node and bone marrow (BM) and sequentially after treatment. RESULTS: Molecular markers were detected in BM of 29 (83%) patients at diagnosis: Bcl-2 rearrangement in 20 patients (90% major breakpoint and 10% minor cluster) and clonal IgH rearrangement in 9 of 15 patients negative for Bcl-2. Molecular and clinical response was noted in 25 (86%) patients after induction treatment. Progression-free survival at 5 years was 78.1 +/- 8%. A correlation between clinical and molecular response was found in 24 patients with molecular markers in BM at diagnosis and >2 years of follow-up: 94% of patients with undetectable MRD showed continuous clinical remission, whereas 50% of patients who reverted back to positive molecular markers relapsed (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of molecular response is high in patients treated with cyclophosphamide-vincristine-prednisone and IFN and MRD sequential analysis is useful for disease surveillance.
