The chromosome band 9p21-22 is frequently rearranged or deleted in a variety of tumors including hematological malignancies. This supports the notion of a tumor suppressor gene in this chromosome region. Indeed, the p16/MTS1 gene encoding a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor has been shown to be frequently deleted and/or inactivated by nonsense mutations in a number of tumors. We have examined 98 DNA samples from blood, bone marrow cells and lymph node biopsies of patients with leukemia (ALL and AML) or lymphoma (follicular lymphoma and T-cell lymphoma), using Southern blot hybridization and a p16/MTS1-specific probe. Molecular abnormalities, mainly homozygous deletions, were found principally in ALL (8 out of 22 patients), much less frequently in AML (2/32) and lymphoma (2/32). While these data argue in favor of a large involvement of p16/MTS1 in ALL, AML and lymphomas appear to be less frequently implicated.
