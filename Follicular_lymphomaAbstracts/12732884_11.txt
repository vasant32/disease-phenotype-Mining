Patients with no prior chemotherapy and with advanced and progressive follicular lymphoma (FCL) or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) were enrolled into a treatment protocol combining CHOP/rituximab-CHOP therapy with subsequent consolidation high-dose therapy (HDT) to evaluate the safety and feasibility of this treatment. Overall, 15 patients were enrolled and 13 patients completed the entire treatment protocol without major toxicities or increased infectious complications. One patient withdrew consent after achieving complete remission (CR) prior to HDT. One patient was taken off study with signs of disease progression after induction treatment. All patients showed stable engraftment after HDT. Response rates appear to be favorable, indicating an additional effect of rituximab and HDT. Overall, 12 of 13 patients achieved CR/CRu and one patient partial remission. Follow-up of immune reconstitution displayed transient severe combined immunodeficiency with slow normalization of the cellular and humoral compartments without a significant increase of infectious complications. Taken together, high-dose chemotherapy can be safely given following treatment with CHOP+rituximab. Efficacy in this small cohort of patients was encouraging with sustained remissions in both FCL and MCL patients. Upfront HDT should be considered as a therapeutic option especially in young and/or high-risk patients.
