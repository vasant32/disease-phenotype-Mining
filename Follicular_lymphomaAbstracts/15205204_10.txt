BACKGROUND: The distribution of the histopathological subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is different among various geographical areas. However, there are few reports concerning cytogenetic findings of NHL, especially T-cell lymphoma, in Asian people. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the chromosomal abnormalities of 200 adult patients with NHL in Taiwan and correlated the non-random aberrations with the histological subtypes. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-eight patients (69%) had B-cell lymphoma. The incidence of the t(14;18) in total lymphoma was lower in Taiwan (12%) than in the West (20-30%), but its incidence in follicular lymphoma was comparable between the two areas (17 of 28 patients, 61% versus approximately 50-60%). Sixty-two patients (31%) had T-cell lymphoma, including 11 angiocentric T/natural killer (NK)-cell lymphoma and only two angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AILD). The recurrent chromosomal abnormalities in T-cell lymphoma comprised 6q deletion (30%), 11q deletion (20%), 17p deletion (16%), -17 (16%), -Y (14%) and + 8 (11%). Angiocentric T/NK-cell lymphoma had a significantly higher frequency of 1q duplication (P=0.001), 6p duplication (P <0.001) and 11q deletion (P=0.011) than other T-cell lymphoma. The incidences of +3 and +5, two common abnormalities in AILD, were quite low in T-cell lymphoma in Taiwan (4% and 2%, respectively), compared with those in the West (16-32% and approximately 15%, respectively). The 11q deletion, not a common aberration in T-cell lymphoma in western countries, occurred quite frequently in Taiwan. CONCLUSIONS: The chromosomal aberrations of NHL are quite different among various geographical areas, which may reflect the differences in the distribution of the histological subtypes of lymphoma among various areas.
