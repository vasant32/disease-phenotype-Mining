The clinicopathological characteristics of malignant lymphomas vary according to geography. The purpose of this study is to determine the distribution and clinicopathological characteristics of malignant lymphomas in Taiwan. Archival tissue from 598 malignant lymphomas during the period of 1995-2002 was retrieved. They were reclassified according to the World Health Organization classification system. Clinical data, including age, gender, clinical staging, and follow-up, were scrutinized. There were 330 males and 268 females. The median age at onset of disease was 56 years for B-cell lymphoma (BCL), 50 years for T/NK-cell lymphoma (TCL), and 26 years for Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). BCL accounted for 80.6%, TCL for 12.4%, and HL for 7%. The major subtypes of non-HL were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, plasma cell myeloma, marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type, mantle cell lymphoma, unspecified peripheral TCL, and nasal type T/NK-cell lymphoma. Nodular sclerosing subtype was the most common in HL. The frequencies of TCL and HL were relatively low. For histological subtype, enteropathy-type TCL and primary bone marrow HL had higher frequency and poorer prognosis. The 5-year overall survival of BCL, TCL, and HL was 58.9, 34.7, and 83.5%, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest series study of malignant lymphoma in Taiwan. Immunophenotype, histological subtype, and clinical stage play significant roles in prognosis (P < 0.05).
