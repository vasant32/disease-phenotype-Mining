We studied an unusual type of lymphoma of the ileocecal region using an established protocol that combines morphologic, flow cytometric, and immunohistochemical analyses. This lymphoma grew as multiple submucosal nodules, some of which had coalesced into a mass in the terminal ileum. Histologically, the lesion resembled a lymphoma of follicular center-cell origin except for germinal centers that appeared reactive and greatly expanded follicular mantles. Flow cytometric studies showed that the lymphoma contained a monoclonal, kappa+ population of B-lymphocytes. Evaluation of sections of frozen tissue by an immunoperoxidase technique revealed that the germinal centers were polyclonal (nonneoplastic) and that the neoplastic cells were confined to the mantle zone. The additional information led to classification of the neoplasm as the mantle zone variant of intermediate lymphocytic lymphoma. This type of lymphoma may pursue a more aggressive course than a follicular lymphoma derived from the germinal center. We review our general approach to the analysis of hematolymphoid neoplasms and discuss how certain techniques may be useful adjuncts in the evaluation of these types of tumors.
