We describe a 51-year-old woman with recurrent follicular lymphoma from the age of 47 despite chemo-radio therapy, who subsequently underwent nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation with conditioning consisting of fludarabine and low-dose total body irradiation (2 Gy). Myelosuppression was very mild, so the patient required no transfusions. Chimerism analysis from peripheral blood showed that T-cell mixed chimerism continued over 12 months after stem cell transplantation (the percentage of recipient T-cells was approximately 20%). Despite this, the lymphadenopathy disappeared, and the patient developed grade II acute GVHD (graft versus host disease). It has been considered that the establishment of full donor chimerism is required to induce GVHD and GVM (graft versus malignancy) effects. In this case, however, an allo-response was observed despite the persistence of T-cell mixed chimerism.
