Composite lymphoma is a rarely reported entity, defined as two or more morphologically distinct types of lymphoma at the same anatomic site, occurring either synchronously or metachronously. Since 1978, about 100 case reports of composite lymphoma have been cited, many involving combinations of low-grade B-cell lymphomas. To our knowledge, no cases of large-cell transformation of composite lymphoma have yet been described. We report the case of a patient who presented with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) fifteen years after successful treatment for a mature B-cell lymphoma. Reassessment of the patient's lymph node from 1995, using techniques not previously available, resulted in a revised diagnosis of composite lymphoma, comprising both follicular lymphoma (FL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Analysis of B-cell gene rearrangement studies using BIOMED-2-based PCR, and of t(14;18) rearrangements by both FISH and PCR, provided evidence that the DLBCL evolved from transformation of the composite lymphoma, specifically from its FL component. B-cell gene rearrangement studies also supported a clonal relationship between the FL and SLL components of the composite lymphoma.
