Thirty-one patients, 13 adults and 18 children, were included in a phase II study of combined treatment with CDDP 40 mg/m2 and VP16 100 or 200 mg/m2 for 5 days. Fourteen patients were primary refractory to front-line treatment and 17 were treated at relapse (9 on therapy, 8 off therapy). Four were low-grade follicular lymphomas, 7 intermediate grade lymphomas, and 20 high grade lymphomas. One of the 14 primary refractory cases responded (CR) whereas 3 PR and 10 CR were observed among the 17 relapses. Toxicity was acceptable. 9 patients are still alive after bone marrow transplantation (median survival, 16 months). This combination is an effective salvage regime before autologous bone marrow transplantation for relapsed NHL, but cannot be recommended for progression on front-line therapy.
