Chromosome aberrations affecting 3q27 are among the most frequent non-random abnormalities in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), especially the diffuse, large cell type. Recently, an association between BCL6 rearrangement and frequent extranodal lesions, rare bone marrow infiltration and a favorable clinical outcome was reported. We performed molecular studies of the BCL6 gene in 54 patients with NHL. Twelve patients (22%) with rearranged BCL6 genes were selected for histological, clinical, molecular, and cytogenetic studies. Ten of these cases were diffuse, large cell type lymphoma, one a follicular lymphoma, and one a mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). All cases were of the B-cell type and this is the first time a rearranged BCL6 gene has been found in an MCL. Cytogenetic data for 10 cases were available and the partner sites of the 3q27 translocation were determined in 7 of 10 patients. These locations were variable, including 6p21.3, 9p22, and 14q11 in addition to the immunoglobulin loci 14q32 (IGH), 2p12 (IGK), and 22q11 (IGL). The heterogeneity in partner sites is distinct from other lymphoma subgroups and may suggest that the genetic events are not uniform among patients with BCL6 rearrangements.
