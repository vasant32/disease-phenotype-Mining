To complement the existing treatment guidelines for all tumour types, ESMO organizes consensus conferences to focus on specific issues in each type of tumour. In this setting, a consensus conference on the management of lymphoma was held on 18 June 2011 in Lugano, next to the 11th International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma. The conference convened âˆ¼30 experts from all around Europe, and selected six lymphoma entities to be addressed; for each of them, three to five open questions were to be addressed by the experts. For each question, a recommendation should be given by the panel, referring to the strength of the recommendation based on the level of evidence. This consensus report focuses on the three less common lymphoproliferative malignancies: marginal zone lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and peripheral T-cell lymphomas. A first report had focused on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.
