Two hundred and six patients with biopsy-proven lymphoma, 74 with Hodgkin's disease and 132 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma had abdominal computed tomography for assessment of remission status (108 patients) or for investigation of relapse (98 patients). In 43 patients with diffuse large cell lymphomas scanned at a time of apparent complete remission CT was abnormal in 21. Sixteen of these patients have relapsed and died. Only one patient has relapsed in the group who have normal CT scans. This difference was significant (p=0.00001). This difference was not seen in nodular lymphomas. There were very few patients with Hodgkin's disease in whom the CT scan was abnormal and there is a suggestion that many abnormalities following treatment may represent inactive Hodgkin's disease or fibrosis only. CT played a major role in diagnosing the full extent of relapse in both non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease. Over 50% of the abnormal sites detected by CT would not have been shown by any other non-invasive investigation. Five patients with treated Hodgkin's disease who had "B" symptoms only suggesting relapse were all shown by CT to have extensive intra-abdominal disease.
