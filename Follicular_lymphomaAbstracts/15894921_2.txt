T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma (THRLBCL), a proliferating peripheral B-cell neoplasm, is a morphologic variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which may be confused with Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and reactive lymphadenopathies. Though more recent studies suggested that it might be a distinct clinicopathologic entity and/or a heterogeneous entity with derivation from germinal center B cells, its histogenetic derivation remains controversial. The authors analyzed 30 cases of THRLBCL to further characterize the origin of the neoplastic cells using immunohistochemical and molecular studies for expression of Bcl-6, CD10, and CD138, as well as rearrangements of IgH/bcl-2 genes on paraffin-embedded tissue. Half of the cases (15/30) showed Bcl-6 expression and five cases (19%) showed CD10 expression, but none had CD138 expression (0/20). Only three cases showed coexpression of both Bcl-6 and CD10. Molecular studies performed in 21 cases detected rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy gene in 18 cases, with none having detectable Bcl-2 gene rearrangement. These data indicate that similar to DLBCL, the cell origin of neoplastic cells in THRLBCL is composed of a heterogeneous group of proliferating peripheral B cells, with only some cases originating from germinal center B cells and others derived from heterogeneous origins. Lack of Bcl-2 gene rearrangements seems to argue against a possible progression from preexisting follicular lymphoma. Thus, the normal counterpart of the neoplastic cells cannot at this time be the sole basis for the subclassification of THRLBCL.
