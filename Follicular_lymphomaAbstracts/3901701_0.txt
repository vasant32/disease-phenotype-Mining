A 65-year-old man was admitted for dysuria. He had been irradiated 60Co for malignant lymphoma of tonsils 2 years earlier. The findings of palpation of prostate, retrograde urethrogram and urethroscopy strongly suggested benign prostatic hypertrophy. Retropubic prostatectomy was performed and 18 g of "adenoma" was resected. By histological observation, the "adenoma" proved to be malignant lymphoma. This tumor belonged to follicular lymphoma, medium-sized cell type of LSG non-Hodgkin's lymphoma classification. After the operation, he left our hospital for a personal reason and received systemic chemotherapy at another hospital.
