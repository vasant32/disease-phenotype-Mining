AIMS: The pathogenesis and clinical significance of marginal zone differentiation in follicular lymphoma remains to be determined, although genetic alterations are likely to be important determinants of both. We therefore report the cytogenetic findings in three cases of follicular lymphoma with marginal zone differentiation studied by routine karyotyping and in-situ hybridization. METHODS AND RESULTS: The morphology and immunophenotype of each case was typical of follicular lymphoma displaying marginal zone differentiation. Karyotyping, performed on GTL-banded preparations of cell cultures derived from fresh lymph node tissue, revealed a complex karyotype in all three cases, including t(14;18)(q32;q21) and abnormalities associated with progression and/or transformation of follicular lymphoma. In addition, trisomy 3 was found in one case and translocations between the q27-29 region of chromosome 3 and chromosome 2 in the other two cases; the latter was identified only in subclones derived from less complex stem lines possessing t(14;18). In-situ hybridization, performed on sections cut from routinely processed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks, localized cells possessing these abnormalities of chromosome 3 to both the follicular and marginal zone components of two lymphomas studied in this way. CONCLUSIONS: Trisomy 3 and alterations involving the q27-29 region of chromosome 3 are implicated in the pathogenesis of de novo marginal zone lymphoma. Their presence in the current cases indicates that they may also be responsible for marginal zone differentiation in follicular lymphoma when cells harbouring these genetic alterations are exposed to the appropriate microenvironment. Our findings are consistent with follicular lymphoma with marginal zone differentiation as a high-risk variant of follicular lymphoma.
