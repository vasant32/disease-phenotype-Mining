The aim of the present study was to examine the clinicopathological presentations of follicular lymphomas (FL) of the salivary glands, as compared to mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. A total of 27 primary salivary gland lymphomas were examined: 6 FL (five, grade 1; one, grade 2); 19 MALT lymphomas; and two diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. The FL patients ranged in age from 24 to 73 years, with a mean of 49 years, which was younger than that of MALT patients (mean: 64 years; P < 0.05). Four of the six FL arose from the submandibular gland, which was the origin of only five out of a total of 19 MALT lymphomas. One FL patient was in clinical stage (CS) IE, two in CS IIE, and two in CS III and IV. As regards the MALT lymphoma patients, 13 (68%) were in CS IE and five (26%) in CS IIE. None of the FL patients had clinical diagnosis of autoimmune disease but eight MALT lymphoma patients had autoimmune disease. The present study found a relatively high incidence of FL in the salivary glands. The observed differences in age of onset, background of autoimmune disease, and lesion site suggests that the pathogenesis of FL may differ from that of MALT lymphoma.
