Bcl-2, the gene over-expressed in follicular lymphomas (FL), is able to block chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Consequently, we wondered whether bcl-2/IgH expression variations during treatment of FL could predict the outcome of patients with t(14;18)-bearing FL. For this purpose, we used a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay to analyse 180 serial peripheral blood samples (PBS) during 34 treatment phases in 25 patients with t(14;18)-bearing FL. In all patients but two, bcl-2/IgH gene expression was demonstrated in pre-treatment samples. During 16 out of the 34 treatment phases (47%), bcl-2/IgH expression became negative: all but one were responders to chemotherapy. This conversion was transient in six cases. In 18 treatment phases, bcl2/IgH expression remained detectable: eight were clinically considered as treatment failures, while eight others achieved PR and two achieved CR. We observed a significant correlation between treatment response and RNA PCR results (P = 0.002). Three-year overall survival of patients with stable bcl2/IgH-negative conversion was 100% compared to 54% for the remaining patients (P = 0.069); 3-year freedom from progression was respectively 87.5% and 13% (P = 0.005). These results indicate a correlation between bcl-2/IgH expression variations and both clinical response and outcome. Whether this might predict disease outcome early remains to be confirmed.
