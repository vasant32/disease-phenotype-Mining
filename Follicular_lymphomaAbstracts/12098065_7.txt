Between 1993 and 2000, 24 patients with follicular lymphoma underwent high-dose chemo/radiotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Median age was 44 years, median interval from diagnosis to HSCT was 24 months and the median number of prior lines of treatment was three. Donor source was HLA matched sibling (23) or matched unrelated donor (one). Conditioning therapy was busulfan based in 22 patients and included total body irradiation in two. All patients received i.v. cyclosporine A and short-course methotrexate for GVHD prophylaxis. Nineteen patients are alive, a median of 2.3 years post HSCT. Death occurred due to transplant complications in four patients and one patient died of a stroke 10 months post HSCT. No patients have relapsed. The overall and progression-free survival was 78% (95% CI 63-97). Allogeneic HSCT for patients with progressive follicular lymphoma is feasible and may result in prolonged disease-free survival.
