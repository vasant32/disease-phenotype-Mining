Nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (NMZL) is a relatively uncommon type of lymphoma. Because of the rarity, the natural history and the optimal treatment modality have not been well defined. Therefore, we performed a retrospective analysis of the clinical features and treatment outcomes of NMZL. Thirty-six patients who were histologically diagnosed as NMZL were included in the analysis. Fifty-three percent of the patients had localized disease (stages I and II), and 21.2% (7/33) had bone marrow involvement at presentation. B symptom was present in only three patients (8.3%). Most patients were categorized as low or low-intermediate risk group by international prognostic index (IPI) (77.1%). Majority (94.4%) of the patients with localized disease achieved complete remission (CR) after the initial treatment. Of the seven patients with disseminated disease, who were treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy, four patients achieved CR. Of the seven patients who received nonanthracycline-based chemotherapy, no patient achieved CR. After the median follow-up duration of 36 months, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.9 (95% CI; 2.9-5.6) years, and the estimated 5-year PFS and overall survival rates were 47.2 and 82.7%, respectively. The significant predictive factors for PFS were performance status, advanced stage, and follicular lymphoma IPI (FLIPI) in this study. This clinical feature is similar to FL rather than to MZL-MALT type.
