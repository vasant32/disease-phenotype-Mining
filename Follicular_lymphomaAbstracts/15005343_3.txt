Chromosomal translocation t(14:18)(q32;q21) is one of the most common karyotypic abnormalities in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. It occurs in more than 85% of follicular lymphoma (FL) cases. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-Rt-PCR) analysis using double-labeled fluorogenic probes is a new tool in the detection and quantification of t(14;18)-carrying cells. We analyzed 239 specimens with Q-Rt-PCR to detect and quantify t(14;18)-carrying cells. To investigate the clinical usefulness of the quantitative assessment, we analyzed the clinical correlation with 92 FL patients of varying clinical status. Of 59 previously untreated patients, patients with stage IV disease had significantly higher quantities of t(14;18)-carrying cells measurable in the bone marrow or the peripheral blood than patients in clinical stages I to III (P = .003 and .043, respectively). Moreover, of the 33 posttherapy patients. the patients in complete remission appeared to have lower detectable levels of t(14;18)-carrying cells than patients in partial remission or with recurrent disease. Q-Rt-PCR permits a sensitive and quantitative assessment of the extent of disease involvement in patients with t(14;18)-carrying FL. The technique has the potential to be a useful tool in the diagnosis of FL, disease assessment, and prognosticating patients' clinical outcomes.
