T-cell antigen expression can be observed in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). Although CD5 is expressed in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma, the presence of other T-cell antigens is less common. This article reports a retrospective multicenter analysis in which flow cytometry was used to evaluate aberrant CD8 expression on the pathologic B cells of 951 bone marrow samples from patients with various types of B-NHL. In a total of 18 patients, CD8 was coexpressed: 10 had B-CLL; 1, small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL); 1, marginal zone lymphoma; 1, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma; 2, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; and 3, follicular lymphoma. There was a 1.89% overall frequency of CD8 coexpression in which B-CLL/SLL had a higher frequency (3.03%) than did the other B-cell neoplasms (1.18%). Most cases were characterized by a favorable outcome.
