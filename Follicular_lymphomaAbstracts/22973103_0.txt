The aim of this study was to develop a temperature-induced polyethylene glycol (PEG) water phase/polysaccharide water-phase emulsion approach for preparing interferon alpha-2b (IFNα-2b)-loaded polysaccharide nanoparticles. IFNα-2b was first added to a mixture of an aqueous solution of PEG and polysaccharide. The mixture solution was stirred in a magnetic stirrer at a rate of 2000 rpm for 45 seconds at 0°C ± 0.5°C. The solution was then prefrozen at different temperatures. The polysaccharide and IFNα-2b partitioned in the polysaccharide phase were preferentially separated out as the dispersed phase from the mixture solution during the prefreezing process. Then the prefrozen sample was freeze-dried to powder form. In order to remove the PEG, the powder was washed with dichloromethane. Once IFNα-2b was loaded into the polysaccharide nanoparticles, these nanoparticles could gain resistance to vapor-water and water-oil interfaces to protect IFNα-2b. The antiviral activity of the polysaccharide nanoparticles in vitro was highly preserved (above 97%), while the antiviral activity of IFNα-2b-loaded polysaccharide nanoparticles using the control water-in-oil-in-water method was only 71%. The antiviral activity of the IFNα-2b from blood samples was also determined on the basis of the activity to inhibit the cytopathic effects of the Sindbis virus on Follicular Lymphoma cells (FL). The antiviral activity in vivo was also highly preserved (above 97%). These polysaccharide nanoparticles could be processed to different formulations according to clinical requirements.
