Epidural localization is a rare presenting sign of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. These tumours are classified in the majority of cases as large B cell lymphomas. Low grade lymphomas are rarely reported. We report a 43-year-old woman admitted for a total functional disability of the two lower limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a spinal epidural mass extending from D7 to D9. A laminectomy was performed. The histopathological study revealed a follicular lymphoma. The patient underwent a spinal irradiation and chemotherapy. Follow up evaluation at 16 months demonstrated no evidence of relapse. Our purpose is to describe the clinical features, the pathologic findings, the treatment and the prognosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma revealed by an epidural involvement.
