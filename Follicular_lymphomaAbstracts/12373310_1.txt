Whether a common and a single clone present, or not, among follicles of follicular lymphoma (FL) was examined in 12 cases with FL. Histologic grade was I in 6 cases, II in 3, and III in 3. DNA was selectively extracted from the neoplastic follicles of paraffin-embedded samples with use of laser capture microdissection method, and used for PCR-based analysis of rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene. Three different follicles in each case of FL were microdissected. Semi-nested PCR was performed using two sets of primers (Fr2A and Fr3A). In PCR with Fr2A primers, nine of 12 cases showed a common band among neoplastic follicles. The remaining three cases showed no PCR products. With Fr3A primers, eight of 12 cases showed a common band among follicles of the same case. The other four cases showed oligoclonal bands, among them presence of a common band was difficult to assess. Oligoclonal bands were more frequently observed in PCR with Fr3A than that with Fr2A and in grade I or II than in grade III cases. In total, 11 of 12 cases showed a common band in PCR with either Fr2A or Fr3A primers. In two cases, DNA extracted from whole section was amplified with both Fr2A and Fr3A or only Fr3A primers, showing smear or oligoclonal bands. These results showed the presence of a single clone of cells in neoplastic follicles of FL and the usefulness of PCR-based rearrangement analysis of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene combined with microdissection methods for differential diagnosis of FL from follicular hyperplasia.
