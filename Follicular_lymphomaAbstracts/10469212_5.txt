 AIMS: While it may be difficult to discriminate between chronic gastritis, MALT lymphoma and a gastric location of a nodal lymphoma using histology of small endoscopic biopsies alone, additional markers like CD10, CD75 and CD43 and proliferative activity may be of value. We assessed the expression of these antigens in MALT lymphoma and their usefulness in discriminating MALT lymphoma from follicular lymphoma and from gastritis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Tissue samples of 38 patients with gastric MALT lymphoma were immunohistochemically stained for expression of CD10, CD75 and/or CD43. Proliferation index was scored using MIB-1 staining. Ten cases of nodal follicle centre B-cell lymphomas (n = 11) and 18 cases of high-grade MALT lymphoma (n = 22) showed moderate to high CD75 expression (25-100% positive cells). All tested low-grade MALT lymphomas (n = 9) and chronic gastritis (n = 6) were negative (0-25%) for CD75. All MALT lymphomas (n = 25) were negative for CD10. High-grade lymphomas show significantly higher proliferation indices (67% vs. 16%) than low-grade lymphomas. Only four of 26 MALT lymphomas were slightly positive for CD43. All gastritis biopsies (n = 4) were negative for CD43. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that combining both CD10 and CD75 may be useful in discriminating between low-grade MALT, high-grade MALT lymphoma and extranodal location of follicular lymphoma. However, CD43 expression cannot in the majority of cases be used to distinguish between low-grade MALT lymphoma and gastritis.
