The t(3;14)(q27;q32) is the most common translocation involving BCL6 in B-cell lymphoma. Although this translocation was predominantly associated with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), recent studies have shown that it can also be found in follicular lymphomas (FL), often associated with a large cell component. To further investigate the relationship that might exist between this translocation and the phenotype of the tumors, we studied 34 lymphomas with a t(3;14)(q27;q32). Twenty cases were DLBCL, 14 FL and most cases, regardless of histology, were negative for the expression of CD10 (26/32, 81%). We identified the IGH switch region involved in the translocation for 32 cases. Our data indicate that in DLBCL most breakpoints involve the switch mu (17/19; 89%), whereas in FL most involve a switch gamma (9/13; 70%) (P=0.0016, Fisher's exact test). This correlation between the histology and the structure of the translocated allele suggests that the lymphomas with Smu and Sgamma translocations may originate from different cells, or that the substituted regulatory regions that come to deregulate BCL6 may affect the presentation of the disease.
