Seven cases of generalised non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (lymphosarcoma, giant follicular lymphoma and reticulum cell sarcoma) were treated by whole-body irradiation as a preliminary study in this centre. Historical background, rationale, treatment technique, and results of such treatment are discussed in this paper. All patients responded, two completely, and five partially. A multicentre clinical trial is recommended to evaluate the results of whole-body irradiation in comparison with chemotherapy in generalised non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.
