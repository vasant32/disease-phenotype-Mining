One hundred thirty-four cases of Stages III and IV nodular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, subclassified according to the criteria of Rappaport, were assessed for parafollicular small lymphocytes and vascular prominence and degree of nodularity. Statistically significant correlations with survival were found for the groups in the Rappaport classification but not for groups based on the amount of parafollicular small lymphocytes or vascular prominence (PSL grading). In the subgroup of patients with nodular poorly differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma, a significant difference in survival time was found between those with pure nodular patterns and those with 25--60% diffuse areas.
