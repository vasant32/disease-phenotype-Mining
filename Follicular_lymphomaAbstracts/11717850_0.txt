Microarray technology has recently led to the identification of molecular prognostic subgroups in non Hodgkin's lymphomas. In order to determine the usefulness of ready-made macroarrays as routine diagnosis tools in haemato-pathology, we have analysed lymph node biopsies using a cDNA macroarray containing genes involved in apoptosis, including caspases. Nine biopsy specimens were analysed on total frozen tissues: 4 samples of B-cell follicular lymphoma (FL), two of B-cell diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL), and three of non-neoplastic lymph nodes from benign lymphadenitis. Eight cell populations were sorted from fresh tissues: malignant B-cells from 2 FL cases and 2 DLCL cases, reactive B-cells from 1 benign lymph nodes, reactive T-cells from 1 benign lymph node, virgin (mantle zone) B-cells and germinal center (GC) B-cells from benign tonsils. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) on paraffin sections was performed for localization of caspases 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9. In the clustered array data, sorted cells from samples sharing common histological lesions grouped together, whereas the array/histology correlation was less satisfactory for tissues. The expression profiles of both array and IHC methods were correlated for most caspases and samples. Variations in array profiles of sorted cell populations can be statistically associated with specific histological features, suggesting a possible diagnostic application of ready-made "Apoptosis macroarrays" in haematopathology.
