The frequent occurrence of BCL2-IgH rearrangements in follicular lymphoma (FL) makes detection of low numbers of tumor cells possible by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The presence of BCL2-IgH in the bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood of many FL patients at the time of autografting has led to the suggestion that selection of the CD34-enriched fraction may lead to reinfusion of lower numbers of tumor cells. To address this issue, we PCR-amplified BCL2-IgH from fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-purified BM CD34+ and CD34- fractions in seven FL patients showing a PCR-detectable translocation in the major breakpoint region of BCL2, five of which showed morphological BM involvement. The total CD34+ fraction showed diminished but residual positivity in the first two cases tested. Therefore, BM cells from the remaining five patients were sorted for the CD34+19- immature population, the CD34+19+ B-cell precursors, and the CD34-19+ mature B-cell fraction. The CD34+19- subpopulation was negative in four of five, despite evident BM infiltration in three cases. In contrast, the CD34+19+ fraction was positive in all three cases tested. These cells represented 0% to 50% (mean, 18%) of the total CD34+ population, suggesting that, if reinfusion of BCL2-IgH-positive cells plays a role in postautograft relapse in FL, therapeutic CD34 selection procedures should include additional purging of the CD34+19+ B-cell precursors or, at least, assessment of the proportion of CD19+ cells in the CD34+ fraction and its correlation with clinical outcome postreinfusion.
