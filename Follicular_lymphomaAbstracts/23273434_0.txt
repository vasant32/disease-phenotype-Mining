 PURPOSE: Bortezomib has previously demonstrated activity in indolent lymphomas including follicular lymphoma with response rate ranging from 13% to 56%. However, the optimal schedule of bortezomib remains to be investigated in follicular lymphoma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted a randomised phase II study where patients with follicular lymphoma in relapse or refractory receive either bortezomib 1.5 mg/m(2) biweekly on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 of a 21-day cycle (arm A) or 1.6 mg/m(2) weekly on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of a 35-day cycle (arm B). An interim analysis was planned after 15 fully evaluable patients randomised in each treatment arm. If only five subjects or fewer respond, the treatment arm was concluded to be ineffective and was closed to inclusion. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients were included in the trial. Arm B was closed to inclusion after interim analysis. 15/50 patients (30%) in arm A and 8/37 patients (22%) in arm B achieved a response. Median duration of response was 16 and 15 months for arms A and B, respectively. Most drug-related adverse events (AEs) (all grades, all cycles) were mild. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates tolerability and durable clinical benefit of bortezomib when given at 1.5 mg/m(2) biweekly. Despite a higher response rate in the biweekly arm, no major difference in patient's outcome was observed between the two arms in the final analysis.
