The frequency of various subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) differs in various regions worldwide. We studied distribution of various subtypes of NHL by using WHO classification of lymphoid neoplasms (2000), immunophenotyping and clinicopathologic characteristics of various histologic subtypes in 935 cases. B- and T-cell NHL constituted 79.3% and 18.8% of cases. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBL) was the most common subtype (50.2%). A lower frequency of follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) was noted compared to that observed in the developed countries, whereas a lower frequency of peripheral T-cell lymphoma - not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) and extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma was seen compared to that in the other Asian countries. A higher frequency of DLBL and precursor T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma was noted. Extranodal and bone marrow involvement in MCL and PTCL-NOS was less frequent. Anaplastic variant of DLBL was noted in 21.5% of all DLBLs. Null/T-cell anaplastic large cell lymphoma presented in the older age.
