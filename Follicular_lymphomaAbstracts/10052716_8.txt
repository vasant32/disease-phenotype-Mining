V(H) gene family specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was performed in 87 B-cell lymphoma samples from 4 different subgroups. No apparent restriction in the VH gene usage was found in follicular lymphomas, lymphoplasmacytoid lymphomas or large B-cell lymphomas, whereas a biased VH1 utilization was shown in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Eleven of 18 chronic lymphocytic leukemia cases utilized the VH1 gene family, and nucleotide sequencing of the VH1 gene rearrangements revealed that a majority utilized the DP10 (51p1) germline gene, which has been reported to be strongly associated with autoimmune disease. No VH5 or VH6 rearrangements were amplified in the chronic lymphocytic leukemia subgroup, 2 gene families which previously have been found to be over-represented in these patients. In a high proportion (40%) of large B-cell lymphomas, VH gene family-specific PCR failed to amplify any rearrangement. Using primers hybridizing to the framework regions 2 and 3 and Southern blot analysis of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus, clonal rearrangements were displayed in two-thirds of these PCR negative cases. However, the rearrangement status could not be elucidated in 5 of 35 patients with large B-cell lymphoma.
