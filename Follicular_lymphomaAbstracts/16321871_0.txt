A 48-year-old male patient with follicular lymphoma, grade II, stage IV, was treated with CHOP, ESHAP and MACOP-B, resulting in partial remission. After 9 months, the disease progressed and several chemotherapy agents, including three courses of rituximab combined with etoposide, sobuzoxane or methotrexate, only resulted in a stable disease response. However, the fourth course of rituximab combined with a small dose of melphalan produced excellent results and the complete response continued for more than 15 months. It is possible that these two drugs may act synergistically.
