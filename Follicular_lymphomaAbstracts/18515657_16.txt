Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a B-cell malignancy characterized by the t(14;18) translocation. Although sensitive to treatment, the disease remains incurable and the reason why tumor cells invariably evade treatment, leading to clinical relapse, is still unknown. Here, we tracked the clonal history of tumor cells by studying mutations introduced by activation-induced cytidine deaminase on the switch mu region of the der(14)t(14;18) during the early phase of the class-switch recombination (CSR) process. We observed frequent intraclonal variations, suggesting that CSR often remains active after the acquisition of the fully transformed phenotype. However, mutations only rarely accumulated over time, but instead showed complex evolutionary scenarios and 2 different progression pathways. The first pathway was a direct and rapid evolution from the dominant clone. The second was indirect, arising from earlier subclones usually after years of remission. A better understanding of these mechanisms might influence the future choice of treatment strategies.
