We describe the unusual presentation of a patient with simultaneous follicular lymphoma and metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. He was initially treated for his lymphoma and then, following no regression in his cervical lymphadenopathy was referred for further assessment. This revealed squamous cell carcinoma arising from the left tongue base with metastatic disease in the left neck.
