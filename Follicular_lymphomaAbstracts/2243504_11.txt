Using a probe for the newly described bcl-3 gene near the breakpoint of the t(14;19), 176 cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia were analyzed. Rearrangement of the bcl-3 gene was found in only one case; a follicular lymphoma involving the salivary gland that had progressed to a diffuse large cell lymphoma. We conclude that rearrangement of the bcl-3 gene as detected by our method occurs rarely in mature B or T cell neoplasms.
