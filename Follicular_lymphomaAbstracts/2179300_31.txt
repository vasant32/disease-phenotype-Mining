A panel of antibodies reactive in routinely fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections was compared with a panel of antibodies reactive in frozen sections for the immunophenotyping of cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders. Three T cell-associated markers (UCHL1, MT-1, MT-2, six B cell-associated markers (MB-1, MB-2, LN-1, LN-2, L-26, 4KB5), immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, anti-LCA antibody, two markers for Reed-Sternberg cells (Ber-H2, Leu-M1), one marker for macrophages (Mac-387) and anti-S-100 protein antibody were tested on normal skin, inflammatory skin diseases, and cutaneous lymphomas and pseudolymphomas. On the basis of the results in frozen sections, 12 inflammatory T cell diseases, 14 T cell lymphomas and pseudolymphomas, and 10 B cell lymphomas and pseudolymphomas were identified. In addition, two cases of specific skin infiltrates of Hodgkin's disease have been examined. Among T cell markers, the greatest sensitivity was exhibited by UCHL1, which stained all but one specimen of T cell infiltrate; it was negative in one specimen of mycosis fungoides that progressed into a T-immunoblastic lymphoma. The combined use of MB-2, LN-2, and 4KB5 identified all B cell proliferations. LN-1 marked germinal centers in all cases of follicular lymphoma and pseudolymphoma. Ber-H2 stained the Reed-Sternberg cells in both cases of Hodgkin's disease and the large cells in the histiocytic type of lymphomatoid papulosis. Mac-387 and anti-S-100 protein antibody recognized macrophages and T-zone histiocytes (Langerhans cells and interdigitating cells), respectively. A panel of antibodies reactive in routinely fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections is proposed that facilitates the identification of most B and T cell infiltrates in the skin.
