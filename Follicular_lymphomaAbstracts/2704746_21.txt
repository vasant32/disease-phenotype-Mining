The bcl-2 gene has been identified as a gene directly involved in the consistent chromosome translocation t(14;18), which is found in approximately 90% of human follicular lymphoma cases, and is a prime candidate for the oncogene playing a crucial role in follicular lymphomagenesis. In this paper, we describe a case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia showing the juxtaposition of the bcl-2 gene on chromosome 18 to immunoglobulin lambda light chain (Ig lambda) gene on chromosome 22 in a head-to-head configuration. Sequencing analysis of the joining site of the bcl-2 gene and Ig lambda gene has shown that the breakpoint is within the 5' flanking region of the bcl-2 gene and about 2.2 kilobases 5' to the joining segment of Ig lambda locus in a germ-line configuration. The extranucleotide, commonly appearing at the joining site of the t(14;18) translocation involving the IgH locus, is absent from the joining site of bcl-2 and Ig lambda. The lack of extranucleotide suggests that the juxtaposition of the bcl-2 and Ig lambda genes occurred during physiological rearrangement of the Ig lambda gene since it has been shown that the rearrangement of the Ig lambda locus is not accompanied by extranucleotides.
