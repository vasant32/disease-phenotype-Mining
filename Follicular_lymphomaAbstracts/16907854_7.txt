Core biopsy has not traditionally been recommended in the study of spleen nodules due to the supposed fragility of this organ leading to a high risk of post-core biopsy complications. A total of 13 patients who presented solid spleen nodules, diffuse splenomegaly, or both on imaging studies (CT, MR, US) were biopsied under ultrasound control with 18G BioPince needles. Cytological (imprints and cytocentrifugates) and histological material were obtained for diagnosis in every case. Malignant lymphomas were the most commonly found pathology (four diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, two follicular lymphomas, one Hodgkin's disease, one B-cell lymphoma, NOS). In addition, there was one littoral-cell angioma, one well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma, metastatic, and one haemangioma. The remaining two cases showed congestive features, and supposed spleen involvement by lymphoma in one of them was ruled out. On follow up, there were no complications related to the core biopsy. Splenectomy was performed in six cases, two diagnostic and four therapeutic. We conclude that core biopsy is a safe and efficient method in the diagnosis of spleen nodules that could be considered in the routine diagnostic algorithm of these lesions.
