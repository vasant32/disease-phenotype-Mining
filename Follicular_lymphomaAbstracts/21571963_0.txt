Hyaline vascular Castleman disease (HV-CD) is a localized benign mass characterized by follicular hyperplasia with atrophic germinal centers, mantle zone hyperplasia, hyaline deposits, and vascular proliferation. Before establishing a diagnosis of CD, several B-cell lymphomas (BCLs) must be considered, including follicular lymphoma (FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and nodal marginal zone lymphoma (NMZL). Conversely, BCLs with prominent atrophic germinal centers and hyaline vascular penetration may closely resemble HV-CD, leading to misdiagnosis. We report 6 cases of BCL with prominent HV-CD-like features, including FL (2 cases), MCL, NMZL (2 cases), and interfollicular large B-cell lymphoma. Histologically, all were initially considered to be HV-CD before additional tests revealed a neoplastic B-cell proliferation. We highlight the clinicopathologic features of these cases in comparison with cases diagnostic of HV-CD. In contrast with HV-CD, BCLs with HV-CD-like features are more likely to manifest clinically with systemic symptoms or generalized lymphadenopathy. Careful histopathologic examination, supported with immunohistochemical studies, flow cytometric immunophenotyping, and judicious use of cytogenetic and molecular analyses, allows identification of the masked neoplastic process. A multifaceted approach, integrating clinical, histologic, and ancillary tests, can help avoid this diagnostic pitfall.
