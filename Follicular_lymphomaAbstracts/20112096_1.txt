Primary pleural lymphoma is a rare entity that has been described in association with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or pyothorax. We report a 63-year-old-man with no history of HIV infection or pyothorax who presented with progressive dyspnea and nonproductive cough. Chest radiography revealed complete opacification of the left hemithorax, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed large left pleural effusion and thin, homogeneous, plaque-like thickening of the parietal pleura. Thoracoscopic pleural biopsy was consistent with grade 1 extranodal follicular lymphoma of the pleura. The authors suggest that physicians should be aware of this rare location of primary pleural lymphoma manifested by plaque-like thickening of the pleura but not accompanied by mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
