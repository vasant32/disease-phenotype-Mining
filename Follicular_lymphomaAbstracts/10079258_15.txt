Splenic marginal zone lymphomas (MZLs) have been found to occur at a high frequency in NFS.N mice congenic for high-expressing ecotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV) genes from AKR and C58 mice. Based on morphological, immunological, and molecular studies of these mice, MZL is clearly recognizable as a distinct disease with a characteristic clinical behavior. MZL was staged according to the degree of accumulation and morphological change of cells within the splenic marginal zone, as follows: 1) a moderate increase in normal-looking MZ cells, judged to be prelymphomatous, and 2) MZL in three variants: i) distinct enlargement of MZ by normal-looking cells (MZL), ii) distinct enlargement of MZ by basophilic centroblast-like cells (MZL+), and iii) extensive splenic involvement by centroblast-like cells (MZL++). The rate of mitosis and apoptosis increases with lymphoma grade. In most cases, emergence of a dominant IgH clonal pattern in paired splenic biopsy and necropsy samples was correlated with progression. MZLs were transplantable and homed to the spleen. MZL may constitute a commonly occurring lymphoma type unrecognized, in part, because of the centroblastic morphology of high-grade MZL and possible overgrowth of lower-grade MZL by more aggressive follicular lymphomas.
