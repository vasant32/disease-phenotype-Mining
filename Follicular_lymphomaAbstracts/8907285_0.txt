Occasional cases with the chromosomal translocations that juxtapose the c-myc oncogene to Ig genes have been reported in large cell, small lymphocytic, immunoblastic, and follicular lymphomas. In this report, we present a 20 year-old female with lymphoblastic lymphoma of B-cell type and a translocation t(8;22), in which cytogenetic, immunologic, and molecular studies were performed. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of this association.
