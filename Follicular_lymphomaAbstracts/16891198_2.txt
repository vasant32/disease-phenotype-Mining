Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) with a nodular pattern of growth is uncommon and may be misdiagnosed initially as a B-cell lymphoma or reactive process. We report a case of a rapidly growing PTCL with a distinctly nodular pattern in an axillary lymph node from an 89-year-old man. Immunohistochemical stains for CD21, CD23, and CD35 highlighted an extensive dendritic cell network that imparted the nodular appearance and, in addition, was associated intimately with the neoplastic cells. The neoplastic cells otherwise had an immunophenotype similar to previously reported cases of PTCL with a nodular pattern and germinal center origin (CD3+, CD4+, CD5+, bcl-6+, CD31+, subset CD10+, subset CXCL13+, and subset CD79a+). Molecular studies confirm a clonal T-cell receptor g gene rearrangement. This case emphasizes unusual morphologic features in a PTCL that may be mistaken for follicular lymphoma or a tumor of follicular dendritic cell origin.
