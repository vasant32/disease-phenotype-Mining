 PURPOSE: AME-133v is a humanized monoclonal antibody engineered to have increased affinity to CD20 and mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) better than rituximab. Safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy were assessed in a phase 1/2 trial in patients with previously treated follicular lymphoma (FL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: AME-133v was characterized in vitro by ADCC and cell binding assays. A phase 1 study was conducted in which 23 previously treated patients with FL were assigned sequentially to one of five dose-escalation cohorts of AME-133v at 2, 7.5, 30, 100, or 375 mg/m(2) weekly × 4 doses. RESULTS: AME-133v showed a 13- to 20-fold greater binding affinity for CD20 and was 5- to 7-fold more potent than rituximab in ADCC assays. Cell binding assays showed AME-133v and rituximab competed for an overlapping epitope on the CD20 antigen, and AME-133v inhibited binding of biotinylated rituximab to CD20 in a concentration-dependent manner. AME-133v was well tolerated by patients and common related adverse events included chills and fatigue. One patient experienced a dose-limiting toxicity of neutropenia. AME-133v showed nonlinear pharmocokinetics with properties similar to rituximab. Selective reduction of B cells during and after AME-133v treatment was shown by flow cytometry of peripheral blood. A partial or complete response was observed in 5 of 23 (22%) patients and the median progression-free survival was 25.4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: AME-133v was safe and well tolerated at the doses tested. AME-133v showed encouraging results as an anti-CD20 therapy in heavily pretreated FL patients with the less favorable FcγRIIIa F-carrier genotype.
