The presence of cytotoxic cells and their activation status were analyzed in tissue sections of 26 follicular lymphomas. To this end, expression of the perforin and granzyme B genes was studied by in situ hybridization experiments, and expression of the TIA-1 antigen was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Cells expressing the granzyme B gene and the perforin gene were detected in all cases. Their density was, however, highly heterogeneous from case to case, ranging from 160 to 7,040 positive cells/cm2 of tissue sections. TIA-1-positive cells were also evidenced in the 10 follicular lymphomas tested. Virtually all cytotoxic cells were located in interfollicular areas. Double labeling immunochemical experiments showed that most cytotoxic cells belonged to the CD8+ T lymphocyte population, although few CD4+ T lymphocytes and CD56+ natural killer cells also expressed the TIA-1 antigen. These findings show that development of a malignant B lymphocyte proliferation is associated with a host-derived immune response involving intratumoral cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Further studies comparing the density of such cells with the final outcome are required to determine whether the intensity of this immune response has a prognostic value.
