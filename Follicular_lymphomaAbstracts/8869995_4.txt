The early experience is reported here of the use of intra-operative frozen-section service by telepathology using the integrated Service Digital Network (ISDN), a commercially available system that is being connected between the Department of Pathology of Tottori University and Matsue City Hospital, a distance of 30 km. The transfer rate is currently 64 kbit/s. The frozen-section service was conducted for a total of 117 tissue specimens (organs) from 100 patients between August 1993 and May 1995. The average time taken for examination of each specimen of frozen section was 13 min, ranging between 2 and 42 min. The average number of transmitted images was 6.2. Six cases necessitated more than 11 transmitted images to make a diagnosis, while 13 cases could be diagnosed from two images only. Correct and permissible diagnoses were obtained in 109 (93.2%) out of 117 specimens when comparing the telepathology diagnosis with that of direct microscopy. Improper or misdiagnosis was made for eight cases (specimens), which were misinterpreted as papillary carcinoma in Basedow's disease, adenoma and hyperplasia in two pheochromocytomas, solid-tubular carcinoma in phyllodes tumor, mastopathy in invasive carcinoma, metastatic carcinoma in astrocytoma, follicular lymphoma in reactive hyperplasia, and lymphadenitis in follicular lymphoma. In retrospect, diagnosis of these cases should have been deferred. From the results, it was concluded that the intraoperative frozen-section service by telepathology may be a worthwhile substitute for hospitals with limited accessibility to local pathology service, in spite of pitfalls in some cases. Well prepared, high-quality frozen section, sufficient verbal communication with surgeons, and a rather conservative attitude on the part of a well-trained pathologist seem to be the essential ingredients for reaching an accurate decision when using telepathology.
