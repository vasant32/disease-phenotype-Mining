The FOXO transcription factors control proliferation and apoptosis in different cell types. Their activity is regulated by posttranslational modifications, mainly by the PI3K-PKB pathway, which controls nuclear export and degradation. We show that FOXO1 is highly expressed in normal germinal center B cells as well as in non-Hodgkin lymphomas, including follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue non-Hodgkin lymphoma, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and mantle cell lymphoma. In contrast, in 31 of 32 classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) cases, Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells were FOXO1 negative. Neoplastic cells of nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma were negative in 14 of 20 cases. FOXO1 was down-regulated in cHL cell lines, whereas it was expressed in non-Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines at levels comparable with normal B cells. Ectopic expression of a constitutively active FOXO1 induced apoptosis in cHL cell lines and blocked proliferation, accompanied with cell-cycle arrest in the G(0)/G(1) phase. We found that, in cHL cell lines, FOXO1 is inactivated by multiple mechanisms, including constitutive activation of AKT/PKB and MAPK/ERK kinases and up-regulation of microRNAs miR-96, miR-182, and miR-183. These results suggest that FOXO1 repression contributes to cHL lymphomagenesis.
