BACKGROUND: The purpose of the current study was to determine the distribution and relative frequency of each subtype of malignant lymphoma in southern Taiwan according to the revised European-American classification of lymphoid neoplasms (REAL). METHODS: The pathology files of a regional hospital in southern Taiwan for 1989-1998 were searched for malignant lymphoma, lymphoproliferative disorder, and Hodgkin disease (HD). The results of light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA (EBER) were correlated with clinical findings, and all cases were classified according to REAL. RESULTS: A total of 205 cases were analyzed retrospectively. There were 197 cases (96.1%) of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and 8 cases (3. 9%) of HD. Among the 197 NHL cases, 161 (81.7%) were of B-cell lineage and 36 (18.3%) were of T-/natural killer cell lineage. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, extranodal marginal zone lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma were the most common B-cell subtypes and represented 47.2%, 19.3%, and 6.1%, respectively, of all NHL cases. Among the 36 cases of T-/natural killer cell lineage, unspecified peripheral T-cell lymphoma (8.6%), T-/natural killer cell lymphoma (angiocentric lymphoma) (4.1%), and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (3.6%) were the most common subtypes. Seven of eight T-/natural killer cell lymphoma cases were positive for EBER. The eight cases of HD were classified as lymphocyte-rich classic (two cases), nodular sclerosis (two cases), and mixed cellularity (four cases) subtypes. Three of these eight cases were positive for EBER. CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge this study is the first in Taiwan using the REAL classification and it again confirms the different geographic distribution of the various subtypes of malignant lymphoma. The frequency of T-/natural killer cell lineage NHL in Taiwan is higher than that in Western countries but not as high as reported previously.
