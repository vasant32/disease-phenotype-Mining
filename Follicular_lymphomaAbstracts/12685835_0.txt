Lymph node or bone marrow biopsy from sixty-one patients affected by aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) were retrospectively evaluated to assess the histology at relapse. Eighteen cases (29.5%) were proven to have relapsed or persistent low-grade lymphoma after conventional therapy. In 5/18 patients association of low and high-grade lymphoma was detectable at diagnosis by bone marrow biopsy. In the remaining 13/18 no evidence of follicular lymphoma was detected at diagnosis. The outcome of these patients was compared to that of 43 patients relapsed without change in histology and treated by a second line therapy. Of these 43 patients, 13 were not responders (NR), 10 achieved a partial remission (PR) and 18 complete remission (CR). Two were lost during follow-up. The 18 patients with residual/relapsed indolent subtype received oral cyclophosphamide (100 mg/day for 15 days every month for six months): 3 of them had NR, 5 CR, and 10 PR. The overall survival (OS) median time was 39 months in low-grade resistant/relapsed patients and 20 months in patients with aggressive histology. OS at 24 months was 71 and 41%, respectively, (p < 0.02). Most of the patients with high-grade disease were refractory or relapsed after a median of five months, whereas cases with low-grade NHL showed a long lasting stable PR. We suggest that the higher grade patients with residual or relapsed low grade lymphoma were, in fact, transformed low-grade at diagnosis and, after removing the more aggressive component by chemotherapy, it is possible to manage these patients by conventional therapy for indolent lymphomas.
