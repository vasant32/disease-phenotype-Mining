The reasons for the positive association between skin cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are not known but may be due to common susceptibility involving suboptimal DNA repair. Therefore, we investigated selected polymorphisms and haplotypes in three DNA repair genes, previously associated with skin cancer and DNA repair capacity, in risk of follicular lymphoma, including possible gene interaction with cigarette smoking and sun exposure. We genotyped 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the ERCC2, XRCC1, and XRCC3 genes in 430 follicular lymphoma patients and 605 controls within a population-based case-control study in Denmark and Sweden. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using unconditional logistic regression and haplotype associations were assessed with a global score test. We observed no associations between variation in the ERCC2 and XRCC1 genes and follicular lymphoma risk. In XRCC3, increased risk of follicular lymphoma was suggested for rare homozygotes of three SNPs [Rs3212024: OR, 1.8 (95% CI, 1.1-2.8); Rs3212038: OR, 1.5 (95% CI, 1.0-2.4); Rs3212090: OR, 1.5 (95% CI, 1.0-2.5)]. These results were strengthened in current cigarette smokers. However, evidence of differences in XRCC3 haplotype distributions between follicular lymphoma cases and controls was weak, both overall and in current smokers. We conclude that polymorphic variation in the XRCC3 gene, but not in ERCC2 or XRCC1, may be of importance for susceptibility to follicular lymphoma, perhaps primarily in current smokers. The link between skin cancer and follicular lymphoma is unlikely to be mediated through common variation in the studied DNA repair gene polymorphisms.
