With the use of DNA-fiber fluorescent in situ hybridization, a BCL2 protein positive follicular lymphoma with a novel BCL2 breakpoint involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) switch mu (S(mu)) region instead of the J(H) or D(H) gene segments was identified. Sequence analysis showed that the genomic breakpoint is localized between the S(mu) region of the IGH complex and the first intron of BCL2. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction showed expression of a unique hybrid IGH-BCL2 transcript involving the transcription initiation site I(mu). Sequence analysis of the V(H) region of the functional nontranslocated IGH allele showed multiple shared somatic mutations but also a high intraclonal variation (53 differences in 15 clones), compatible with the lymphoma cells staying in or re-entering the germinal center. This is the first example of a t(14;18) translocation that results from an illegitimate IGH class-switch recombination during the germinal center B-cell stage.
