A 54-year-old female patient visited our hospital as an outpatient in August 2008 for her growing mass thigh, without pain, redness or fever. She had suffered discomfort from that swelling since she had been diagnosed with erysipelas by a dermatologist she had visited 6 months before and received some medication. Suspicious of a subcutaneous soft tissue tumor, we performed a biopsy, and histological examination of the lesion indicated malignant lymphoma (follicular lymphoma grade 2). PET-CT (as of September, 2008) showed abnormal migration at the right inguinocrural and right external iliac lymph nodes. In view of her age and the that rapid exacerbation, we considered chemotherapy (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine and prednisolone: R-CHOP) and involved field radiotherapy (IFRT) better to perform than 'watchful wait'. PET-CT (as of November, 2008) after 3 courses of R-CHOP therapy showed abnormal migration had been significantly improved (complete remission on PET-CT) and completely disappeared in the right external iliac lymph nodes. For long-term prognosis and prophylaxis of recurrence, we then added 2 courses of chemotherapy (rituximab alone) and IFRT (30 Gy/20 Fr) as radical therapy. She is now doing well and visits our hospital once a month for follow-up after achieving CR with RECIST guideline.
