Patients with follicular lymphoma (FL), where position 158 of FcγR-IIIa is heterozygous valine/phenylalanine or homozygous phenylalanine (F-carriers), have natural killer cells with lower binding affinity to IgG than valine homozygote patients. In addition, F-carriers show less efficacy with rituximab treatment than patients homozygous for valine. LY2469298 is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting CD20, with human germline framework regions, and specific amino acid substitutions engineered into the Fc region to increase effector function in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. This dose-escalation, phase I study was conducted to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of LY2469298 in Japanese patients with previously treated, CD20-positive FL who had not relapsed or progressed within 120 days of prior rituximab. LY2469298 was administered by intravenous infusion at 100 or 375 mg/m(2) weekly for 4 weeks. Ten patients were enrolled (median age, 60 years); all had previously been treated with rituximab. Nine patients were F-carriers while one was homozygous for valine at position 158 of FcγRIIIa. No patients developed dose-limiting toxicities, and the most frequent adverse events were lymphopenia, pyrexia, leukopenia, chills and neutropenia. Five (50%) of the ten patients responded to LY2469298 treatment (three complete responses, one unconfirmed complete response and one partial response). Serum LY2469298 was eliminated in a biphasic manner and the pharmacokinetic profiles were not different from those in a preceding study in the United States. In conclusion, LY2469298 was well tolerated and clinical activity was observed in FL patients pretreated with rituximab, mostly consisting of F-carriers. Further investigation of FL is warranted.
