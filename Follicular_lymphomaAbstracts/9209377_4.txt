We report here a large series of B-cell neoplasms with regard to rearrangement of the BCL6 gene on chromosome band 3q27. Southern blot analysis using probes from the major translocation cluster (MTC) region of the BCL6 revealed rearrangement in 32 of a total of 222 patients with various subtypes of B-cell neoplasm. In non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), rearrangements of the BCL6 gene were not closely associated with a specific histopathologic subtype but distributed in subcategories in the Working Formulation. A comparative study between NHL associated either with BCL2 or BCL6 rearrangement showed that advanced disease and bone marrow involvement were more frequent in BCL2(+) NHL. In contrast, extranodal involvement was more frequently observed in the BCL6(+) NHL. The survival curve of BCL6(+) NHL was characterized by a rapid decline followed by a plateau. Of the total of 32 BCL6(+) patients, 6 carried both BCL2 and BCL6 rearrangements, and showed clinicopathological properties of follicular lymphoma. This study suggests that BCL6 rearrangement is primarily associated with large cell lymphoma, and that BCL2(-)BCL6(+) NHL could potentially be curable with modern combination chemotherapy.
