 PURPOSE: Primary follicular lymphoma of the testis in childhood is rare with only 6 cases previously reported. We present 3 additional cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We extensively analyzed primary follicular lymphoma of the testis in 3 boys. Clinical data were obtained by reviewing patient charts. RESULTS: The patients were 4, 5 and 11 years old, respectively. Two patients presented with painless unilateral testicular enlargement and 1 presented with unilateral hydrocele. Laboratory findings were within normal limits in all patients. Radical orchiectomy was done in all cases. The excised testes were partially or completely replaced by tumor. In all cases the features were those of follicular, large cell-type malignant lymphoma. Tumor cells in all cases were CD20 and CDw75 positive, focally CD23 positive and bcl-2 negative, while in 2 they were CD10 positive and bcl-6 positive. Surface Ig was absent in the 2 cases studied. Karyotyping in 1 case showed a normal karyotype. Staging revealed no evidence of extratesticular disease. All patients underwent combination chemotherapy and were in complete remission 7 to 59 months after therapy. CONCLUSIONS: We present 3 cases of pediatric primary follicular lymphoma of the testis. Pathological findings and clinical features were similar to those in the 6 previously reported cases and suggest that primary pediatric testicular follicular lymphoma may represent unique subset of follicular lymphoma with a particularly good prognosis.
