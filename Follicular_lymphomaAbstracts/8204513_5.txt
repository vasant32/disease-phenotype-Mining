Since June 1985, 121 patients with follicular lymphoma aged 24-61 years (median 43) have received myeloablative therapy (cyclophosphamide: 60 mg/kg x 2, + total body irradiation: 200 cGy x 6) with autologous bone marrow transplantation (CY+TBI+ABMT) as consolidation of 2nd or subsequent remission. The marrow mononuclear cell fraction was treated in vitro with anti-CD20 alone and baby rabbit complement at St. Bartholomew's Hospital (SBH) and with the addition of anti-B5 and anti-CD10 at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) prior to reinfusion. There were 4 treatment related deaths, (nonengraftment 1, haemorrhage 1, systemic fungal infection 1, veno-occlusive disease 1). The median time for neutrophil recovery (> 0.5 x 10(9)/1) was 26 days (range 10 to 59 days), and for platelets (> 20 x 10(9)/1), 30 days (range 12 to 73 days). One patient did not engraft and 7 have had delayed recovery of red cells and platelets (> 3 months). Two other patients have subsequently developed acute myelogenous leukaemia and 5, evidence of myelodyplasia. Seventy-one patients continue in unmaintained remission between 3 months and 7 years, with a median follow up of 2.5 years. Forty-three have developed recurrent lymphoma; 98 remain alive. Freedom from progression was the same, irrespective of whether patients received CY + TBI + ABMT whilst in a complete or partial remission and did not depend on the specific remission in which treatment was given (2nd: 90 patients vs. > 2nd: 31 patients).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
