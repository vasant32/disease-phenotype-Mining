The distribution of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtypes differs around the world but a systematic study of Latin America has not been done. Therefore, we evaluated the relative frequencies of NHL subtypes in Central and South America (CSA). Five expert hematopathologists classified consecutive cases of NHL from 5 CSA countries using the WHO classification and compared them to 400 cases from North America (NA). Among the 1028 CSA cases, the proportions of B- and T-cell NHL and the sex distribution were similar to NA. However, the median age of B-cell NHL in CSA (59 years) was significantly lower than in NA (66 years; P < .0001). The distribution of high-grade (52.9%) and low-grade (47.1%) mature B-cell NHL in CSA was also significantly different from NA (37.5% and 62.5%; P < .0001). Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was more common in CSA (40%) than in NA (29.2%; P < .0001), whereas the frequency of follicular lymphoma was similar in Argentina (34.1%) and NA (33.8%), and higher than the rest of CSA (17%; P < .001). Extranodal NK/T-cell NHL was also more common in CSA (P < .0001). Our study provides new objective evidence that the distribution of NHL subtypes varies significantly by geographic region and should prompt epidemiologic studies to explain these differences.
