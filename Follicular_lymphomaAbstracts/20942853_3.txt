Male gender is an adverse prognostic factor in Hodgkin's lymphoma, but no such association has yet been established in non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Here, we have evaluated whether gender has prognostic impact on the survival of patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the postrituximab era of lymphoma therapies. The study populations consisted of 217 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and 110 follicular lymphoma (FL) patients treated with immunochemotherapy. Hundred and sixty chemotherapy-treated DLBCL patients served as a control group. According to Kaplan-Meier analyses, female patients had a significantly better progression-free survival than men both in DLBCL (4 yr PFS 75% vs. 60%; P= 0.013) and in FL (4 yr PFS 68% vs. 52%, P=0.036) patients treated with immunochemotherapy. In chemotherapy-treated DLBCL patients, no difference in survival between the genders was found. The results support the idea that women seem to respond better to rituximab.
