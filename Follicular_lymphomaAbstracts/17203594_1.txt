Lymphomas rarely present as a localized mass within the dura. We report a case of a 72-year-old woman, normally fit and well, who presented with a sudden episode of grand mal seizure. Imaging studies showed an extra-axial mass arising from the dura, with radiologic features characteristic of a meningioma. The mass was surgically excised, and the histologic features were of a grade 1 follicular lymphoma. Analysis using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) demonstrated t(14:18) translocation. A bone marrow aspirate showed focal infiltration of lumbar vertebra by low-grade follicular lymphoma. Intracranial meningeal involvement by non-Hodgkin lymphoma usually occurs in the form of diffuse leptomeningeal spread. It is seen in high-grade lymphomas, often in association with widespread systemic disease. The majority of cases of dural lymphomas reported in the literature have been primary mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)-type lymphomas. Most of these presented as localized dural masses mimicking meningiomas. Low-grade follicular lymphoma, either primary or secondarily involving the dura, appears to be an exceedingly rare occurrence.
