A specific immune response against the individual idiotypic determinants of clonal immunoglobulins can be elicited in patients with B-cell malignancies. We analyze the clinical outcome and the presence of tumor cells in the blood of 8 patients with follicular lymphoma, vaccinated with autologous idiotype protein from their lymphoma cells. After a median follow-up of 90 months (range: 54 to 128), all patients, except 1, remain in complete clinical remission and 5 are in complete molecular remission. Our results suggest that idiotype vaccination induces long-lasting clinical and molecular remissions and constitutes a potential curative treatment in follicular lymphoma patients.
