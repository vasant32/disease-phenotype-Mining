A murine monoclonal antibody, HNK-1, is known to react with some human leukocytes including all natural killer (NK) cells in peripheral blood. The distribution of cells reacting with this antibody (HNK-1+ cell) was studied in human peripheral lymphoid organs, consisting of five lymph nodes, two specimens of gastric mucosa with lymphoid tissue, two tonsils, one appendix, and two thymuses. Fourteen cases of malignant lymphoma (ML) were also examined. For the demonstration of HNK-1+ cells, the peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) bridge method was applied to cryostat sections of these specimens. It was found that in normal lymphoid organs most HNK-1+ cells were located in lymph follicles, especially in germinal centers, and some were found in 'mixed' regions which indicate outsides of both the follicles and T-zones. Amongst the ML, large clusters of HNK-1+ cells were observed only in two cases of follicular lymphoma, although a few scattered HNK-1+ cells were noted in other ML, including five diffuse B-cell lymphomas, six T-cell lymphomas and one null cell lymphoma. The possible significance of these findings is discussed.
