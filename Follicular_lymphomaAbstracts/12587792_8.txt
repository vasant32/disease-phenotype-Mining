We report a case of low-grade follicular lymphoma presenting as a primary lesion in the intracranial dura. Based on the preoperative MRI, our patient was presumed to have meningioma. A surgical excision was performed and the histology showed features of a grade 1 follicular lymphoma predominately small-cleaved cell type. Postoperative investigations confirmed that it was the only site of involvement. The patient then received cranial radiotherapy and she is doing well with a follow up period of 18 months. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first case of a primary dural grade 1 follicular lymphoma, small-cleaved cell type.
