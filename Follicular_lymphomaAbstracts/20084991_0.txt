BACKGROUND: There are numerous reports from different countries documenting a change in frequency and profile of lymphomas after the onset of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. In Uganda little is known concerning the distribution of lymphoma subtypes diagnosed at the Department of Pathology, Makerere University College of Health Sciences during this period. OBJECTIVE: To examine the frequency and diagnostic profile of lymphomas diagnosed in Uganda in the HIV/AIDS era. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Department of Pathology, Makerere University College of Health Sciences, Kampala, Uganda. SUBJECTS: One thousand and thirteen patients diagnosed with lymphomas in the period 1980-1989. RESULTS: The most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma was Burkitt lymphoma (36%). The frequencies of lymphocytic and histiocytic types were 34.5% and 8.2% respectively. CONCLUSION: There was a decrease in histopathologically diagnosed lymphomas in Uganda in the period 1980-1989. Burkitt lymphoma continues to be the most common subtype diagnosed, some major lymphoma subtypes like T-cell and follicular lymphomas were not reported in the country in the HIV/AIDS era.
