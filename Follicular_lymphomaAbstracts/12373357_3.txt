Fludarabine is a purine analogue which is effective in the treatment of patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia. While pulmonary toxicity due to cytotoxic drugs is increasingly diagnosed, only few cases of interstitial pneumonitis have been described following fludarabine administration. Here we report the first case in the literature of an acute eosinophilic pneumonia associated with peripheral blood eosinophilia after the administration of fludarabine monotherapy for stage IV follicular lymphoma.
