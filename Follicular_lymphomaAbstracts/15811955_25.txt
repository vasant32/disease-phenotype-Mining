Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) consists of a heterogeneous group of tumors. Population-based data on the familial risk for specific histopathologic subtypes have not been established. Such data are useful for clinical counseling and for searching tumor subtypes sharing common genetic pathways. We used the Swedish Family-Cancer Database to calculate standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for histopathology-specific subtypes of NHL in 4455 offspring with NHL whose parents or siblings were affected with different types of lymphoproliferative malignancies. A familial history of NHL significantly increased the risk for NHL (SIRparent = 1.8; SIRsibling = 1.9) and for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (SIRparent = 2.3), follicular lymphoma (SIRsibling = 2.3), and B-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (NOS) (SIRsibling = 3.4). For a parental history of histopathology-specific concordant cancer, the risks were significantly increased for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (SIR = 11.8), follicular NHL (SIR = 6.1), plasma cell myeloma (SIR = 2.5), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SIR = 5.9). Familial clusters for NHL seemed stronger in females and in siblings. Our study provides the first quantification of the familial risks for NHL by histopathology. The present findings give evidence for a strong familial association of NHL, with little differences in the magnitude of risks for various histopathologic subtypes. The patterns of risks in parents and siblings support the hypothesis of an autosomal-dominant component for diffuse large B-cell NHL and a recessive one for follicular NHL.
