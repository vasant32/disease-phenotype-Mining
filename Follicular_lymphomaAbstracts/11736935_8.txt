The localization and establishment of follicular lymphoma (FL) cells in distinct anatomic sites probably involves chemokine and adhesion receptors on the neoplastic cells and appropriate chemokines and adhesion receptor ligands in the microenvironment. Several chemokines play an important role in normal B-cell trafficking and differentiation. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a C-C chemokine that induces chemotaxis of a variety of lymphoid cells through its receptor CCR2. CCR2 is also expressed on B cells, and MCP-1 induces chemotaxis of normal B cells. In this report, we investigated expression and function of CCR2 on FL cells. We found FL cells as well as the t(14; 18)+ B-cell lymphoma line H2 expressed CCR2. MCP-1 potentiated SDF-1-induced chemotaxis of FL cells and H2 cells, but MCP-1 alone did not induce chemotaxis. The specificity of the effects of MCP-1 and SDF-1 was demonstrated by antibody blocking studies. Because FL cells are generally associated with follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), FDCs may be an important source of chemokines. We found that cultured FDCs produced MCP-1, and this production was enhanced by tumour necrosis factor. These data implicate MCP-1 in the migration and localization of FL cells.
