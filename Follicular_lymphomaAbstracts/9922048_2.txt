It is now well established that the clinical and histopathological characteristics of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas may vary significantly throughout the world. However, only a few reports have been published in Latin American countries. In this work, the clinical and pathologic findings of 264 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in Mexico City were analyzed. Diffuse large (14%) and diffuse mixed cell types (20%) predominated among nodal lymphomas. Within the group of patients with high grade malignancies, immunoblastic sarcomas were the most common (40/48). It is important to mention that follicular lymphomas were sporadic (4.5%). Among extranodal lymphomas the most commonly involved site was the gastrointestinal tract (11.3%), followed by the midline (6%). Molecular analysis of 65 cases with immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene probes showed that most lymphomas were of B-cell lineage (66%). The remaining group was composed of T-cell (25%) and bigenotypic malignancies (9%). All attempts to establish a correlation between the clinical stage and histopathological types with the genetic findings were not successful. However, pre-B and bigenotypic lymphomas were observed mainly in patients over 60 years of age. This study highlights some relevant characteristics of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in Mexico.
