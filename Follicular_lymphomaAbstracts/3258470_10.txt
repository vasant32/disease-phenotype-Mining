DRC (dendritic reticulum cell) antigen expression was studied in 38 cases of B-cell lymphomas including follicular lymphoma. The results of this study showed DRC-1 to be expressed in 1/3 of small lymphocytic; 3/3 of mantle zone lymphoma (MZL); 10/10 of follicular, small cleaved; 6/7 of follicular, mixed; 1/2 of follicular, large cell lymphomas. However, DRC-1 was not expressed in any of diffuse, small cleaved (0/6) and diffuse, large cell (0/6). Although S-100 protein was positive in the majority of these DRC-1-positive cases on the paraffin embedded specimens, positive nodules were less intense and smaller in number compared with those of DRC-1 on frozen tissue specimens. These results suggest that in case of small lymphocytic lymphoma found to be positive for DRC-1, the networks of the DRCs are expressed in the pseudofollicular proliferation centers. This study also suggests that the networks of the DRCs newly appear accompanying the neoplastic growth rather than originating from residual germinal centers, and that neoplastic small cleaved cells play a major role in inducing the DRCs in the positive cases of follicular lymphoma, MZL, and small lymphocytic lymphoma.
