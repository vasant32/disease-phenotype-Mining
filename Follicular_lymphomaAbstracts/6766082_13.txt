Fifty-three non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients staged I, IE, II, and IIE after laparotomy, received involved field radiotherapy with or without adjunctive chemotherapy. These cases have been analyzed for survival, disease-free survival, sites of relapse, and subsequent management. For nodular lymphoma patients, the five-year survival figure was 87%. While this represents only modest improvement over survival figures for patients staged I and II by lymphangiography, results for patients with upper torso disease were significantly better. Although there was a definite incidence of relapse, early failures common in the lymphangiogram series, were not seen in this study. Of the total group of 14 patients, 4 relapsed after a minimum complete remission period of 20 months. The five-year survival figure for all presentations of stages I and II diffuse histiocytic lymphoma was 85%. This represents a substantial improvement over the corresponding figure of 36% for patients staged clinically after lymphangiography. The improvement in results is credited to more precise staging of patients with peripheral presentations, the use of adjunctive multiple-agent chemotherapy for abdominal and mediastinal presentations, and more effective treatment for relapse. To date, too few patients with peripheral presentations have been treated to determine the value of adjunctive chemotherapy for nodular or diffuse histiocytic patients.
