 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the practical application of the WHO classification of lymphoid neoplasms, and to investigate the relative frequency and geographic distribution of the subtypes of lymphoma. METHODS: The pathological specimens of 304 cases with lymphoma diagnosed during the period 1994 approximately 2002 in the First Hospital of Peking University were retrospectively studied. The histopathologic, immunophenotypic and clinical data were reviewed and reappraisal was performed according to the WHO classification. RESULTS: There were 20 cases (6.6%) of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) and 284 cases (93.4%) of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). In the 284 NHL cases, B-cell neoplasms accounted for 60.2% and T/NK-cell neoplasms for 39.1%. On subtyping, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma of nasal type, unspecified peripheral T-cell lymphoma, extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT type, angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma were the most common 6 subtypes and amounted to 88.03% of NHL. The distribution of NHL subtype in this group showed important difference from those in some areas in the world. Extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma of nasal type and other peripheral T-cell lymphoma had a higher frequency, but B-small lymphocytic lymphoma and follicular lymphoma were less common in this group than in Western countries. CONCLUSION: The new WHO classification may be applicable to the diagnosis and subtyping of most lymphomas, making the pathological diagnosis easier to practise. A correct diagnosis of ML may be reached by combination of clinic, histological and immunological features.
