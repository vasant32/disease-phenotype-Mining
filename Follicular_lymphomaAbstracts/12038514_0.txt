The molecular background of follicular lymphoma is the formation of chimera(s) by the bcl2 gene and one of the immunoglobulin genes, mainly the heavy chain gene. While the diagnosis of follicular lymphoma is based on histological study, the histology cannot be recommended for the follow-up of efficiency of treatment(s). Sensitive detection of the chimera genes in blood or bone marrow samples can serve as informative data without invasive sampling. In this study, a single-tube multiplex reaction was developed for the simultaneous detection of different chimeras of the bcl2 and immunoglobulin heavy chain genes, molecular hallmarks of follicular lymphoma. The method was optimized for the highest yield of reaction and for reproducing the ratio of components in artificial mixtures of two different chimeras. The method is suitable for fast and accurate molecular characterization of follicular lymphomas and for follow-up of residual disease.
