Multiple lymphomatous polyposis (MLP) is characterized by multiple polyps involving long segments of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. MLP is thought to represent mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) of the GI tract; however, some cases of follicular lymphoma (FL) of the GI tract are found with a multiple polypoid appearance. In the present study, to clarify the cellular origin of MLP, clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement of four cases with MLP was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and analyzed for the presence of somatic mutation. The IgH variable (VH) region sequences of three cases (CD5+ CD10- cyclin D1+) showed a little somatic mutation compared with the closest published germline. The other case (CD10+ CD5- cyclin D1-) was highly mutated and showed intraclonal heterogeneity (ongoing somatic hypermutation). These data indicate that three of the cases with MLP are derived from pregerminal center B cells (mantle zone B cells) and one case with MLP from germinal center B cells. Our study suggests that MLP is a heterogenous group that includes MCL and FL.
