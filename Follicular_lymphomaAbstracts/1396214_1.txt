Immunohistologic analysis of 100 consecutive cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) from the Pathology Department of the University College Hospital, Ibadan, show that the majority (75%) of the NHLs are of B-cell origin. The high grade tumours constitute the bulk of these tumours with a paucity of follicular lymphomas. Low-grade lympho-plasmacytic/cytoid lymphomas are not uncommon. The possible role of the overstimulation of the B-cell immune system in the aetiopathogenesis of the B-cell NHL is highlighted. Further detailed studies to find out potential infective aetiological factors in the development of high grade B-cell lymphomas in the environment is suggested.
