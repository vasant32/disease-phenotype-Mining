The t(14;18)(q32;q21) chromosomal translocation is closely associated with follicular lymphoma. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis has high sensitivity and is used to assess responses to therapy. Quantification of translocation-bearing cells is a possible advantage of real-time PCR over conventional PCR. A collaborative study comparing results from 12 international laboratories is reported.
