Recent studies have shown bcl-2 to be regulated by p53. Other studies have suggested an inverse relationship between p53 and bcl-2 protein expression in breast and colonic cancers and in a variety of subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This study investigates the relationship between bcl-2 and p53 protein expression and the correlation between these findings and the grade and cell type of follicular lymphomas according to the REAL classification. Paraffin-embedded nodal follicular lymphomas (n = 37) were subjected to bcl-2 and p53 immunohistochemistry on tissue sections using a three-step ABC system. Positive immunostaining for both oncoproteins was scored using a three-tiered scale: +, < 10 per cent cells; ++, 10-50 per cent cells; and ++(+), > 50 per cent cells (< 10 per cent was used as a cut-off to define negative tumours). Ninety-seven per cent (36/37) of follicular lymphomas expressed bcl-2 protein in all three grades, manifesting in the small cell (grade 1) through to the large cell (grade 3). p53 protein expression showed a pattern of increasing immunostaining with progression towards the high-grade follicular lymphoma: grade 1 = 6 per cent (1/16); grade 2 = 48 per cent (10/21); grade 3 = 100 per cent (6/6). Five cases comprised varying combinations of grades. This latter finding suggests a role for p53 mutation in the progression/transformation of follicular lymphoma. The mechanism, however, differs from that suggested in breast and colonic cancers, since an inverse relationship between bcl-2 and p53 was not demonstrated in the present study.
