We evaluated the efficacy and safety of patient-specific immunotherapy with mitumprotimut-T idiotype keyhole limpet hemocyanin and granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) following rituximab in patients with follicular B-cell lymphoma. Patients with previously untreated or relapsed/refractory CD20+ follicular lymphoma received 4 weekly infusions of rituximab and those with a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease received mitumprotimut-T and GM-CSF injections subcutaneously. Courses were given monthly for 6 doses, every 2 months for 6 doses, and then every 3 months until disease progression. Computed tomography scans were obtained every 3 to 6 months and reviewed centrally. The primary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS). Among 103 patients treated with rituximab, 92 (54 relapsed/refractory and 38 previously untreated) received mitumprotimut-T/GM-CSF; median age was 53 years, 91% had stage III to IV disease, and 59% had failed earlier therapy. The premitumprotimut-T objective response rate was 47% (2 CRs, 41 PRs). During the mitumprotimut-T treatment phase, 16 patients converted to CR resulting in an overall objective response rate of 60% (18 CRs, 37 PRs). Median EFS was 15.2, 20.8, and 13.5 months for all, treatment-naive, and relapsed/refractory disease patients, respectively. Anti-Id cellular immune responses were detected in 13 of 18 (72%) patients and humoral immune responses in 17 of 83 (20%) patients. Adverse events were usually mild-to-moderate. The most common adverse event was injection site reactions. Mitumprotimut-T/GM-CSF-induced anti-Id cellular immune responses in most patients. The occurrence of late CRs and favorable EFS suggested a clinical benefit of active immunotherapy and led to a placebo-controlled phase 3 trial.
