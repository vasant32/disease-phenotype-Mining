We studied the incidence of numerical chromosome 18 abnormalities in 107 patients with lymphoid malignancies by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a directly conjugated centromeric probe for chromosome 18. Samples were obtained by fine needle aspiration of diseased nodes, bone marrows or peripheral blood. Monosomy 18 was more common in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (43%), small lymphocytic lymphoma (28%), and follicular lymphomas (12.5%) than in diffuse lymphomas (5.3%; p < 0.01). Monosomy 18 was detected in 9.7-17.1% of the cells in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (background, 5.4%; 99% CI, 4.2%-6.6%) and in 8%-16.7% (median, 10%) of the cells in (CLL) (background, 3.4%; 99% CI, 2.5%-4.3%). All patients with monosomy 18 were found to have bone marrow involvement. Of all untreated patients who had disease involving the bone marrow, 32% were found to have monosomy 18. Trisomy 18 was detected in 3.6%-48.2% of the cells in NHL (background, 0.9%; 99% CI, 0.2%-1.6%) and was most common in diffuse large-cell lymphoma (34%) and follicular lymphomas (31%). None of the patients with small lymphocytic lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia had trisomy 18. There was no correlation between trisomy 18 and response to treatment or clinical presentation. In this study, monosomy 18 was observed frequently in patients with lymphoid malignancies that involve the bone marrow and peripheral blood. Our data suggest that important gene(s) located on chromosome 18 may be involved in homing of the malignant lymphocytes to the bone marrow and peripheral blood.
