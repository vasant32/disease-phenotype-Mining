 BACKGROUND: The non-Hodgkin lymphomas are 12(th) most prevalent cancers in Europe. No recent update in the epidemiology of these lymphomas has been performed in our country. We diagnosed 701 new lymphomas during the period beginning January 1, 2000 and ending December 31, 2009 in our center. FINDINGS: The most frequent lymphoma was diffuse large B cell lymphoma, followed by follicular lymphoma and then classic Hodgkin's disease. The male:female ratio is 1.2:1. Diagnosis by age showed that non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is by far more frequent in the 61-80 years old patients. On the other hand, classic Hodgkin's lymphoma is more frequent in the 20-40 years old population. CONCLUSION: Our results are very similar to those published by other centers in Europe and United States.
