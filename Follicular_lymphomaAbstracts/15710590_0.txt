A new method, combining seminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with heteroduplex analysis, was utilized to detect follicular lymphoma (FL) cells in peripheral blood. The method, based on the detection of IgH rearrangements in DNA, detected the presence of monoclonal B cells in FL patients with a high frequency.
