Mantle cell lymphomas (MCLs) are associated with a characteristic t(11;14)(q13;q32) chromosomal translocation. This causes the CCND1 gene on chromosome 11 to be co-localized with the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene on chromosome 14, resulting in increased expression of cyclin D1. The cyclin D1/D3 expression ratio, as an approach to segregate MCLs from other small B-cell lymphomas, has not previously been evaluated in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. We found that mean cyclin D3 expression was lower in MCLs (P < 0.05) than in chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLLs), follicular lymphomas (FLs), marginal zone/mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas (MALTs), multiple myelomas (MMs), and reactive lymph nodes. As expected, mean cyclin D1 expression was increased in MCL (P < 0.05), but in several cases the expression of cyclin D1 did overlap with the level observed in CLLs, FLs, MALTs, MMs, and reactive lymph nodes. The cyclin D1/D3 expression ratio, however, did fully separate MCLs from FLs, CLLs, and reactive lymph nodes. The mean expression ratio was also significantly different between MCL and MALT (P < 0.05), but 3 MCL cases had values overlapping those of some MALTs. The expression ratio was not significantly different between MCL and MM. In conclusion, the cyclin D1/D3 expression ratio gave an improved segregation of MCLs from CLLs, FLs, MALTs, and reactive lymph nodes, as compared with determination of cyclin D1 alone in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue.
