The diagnosis of malignant lymphoma is not difficult. The various subtypes of Hodgkin's disease are easily recognized by the pathologist. The non-Hodgkin's lymphomas can be distinguished from Hodgkin's disease but are more difficult to classify. Staging of the lymphomas has improved. Computerized axial tomography and ultrasonography have assisted in the evaluation of the abdomen. Laparotomy and splenectomy continues to be a useful procedure for the pathologic staging of Hodgkin's disease, but its value will require yearly reassessment as improvements in staging and management are made. The treatment of Hodgkin's disease has been very successful. The majority of patients can be cured of the disease. Therapy has not had a major impact on survival of patients with nodular lymphomas, but has considerably improved the prognosis of patients with diffuse lymphomas.
