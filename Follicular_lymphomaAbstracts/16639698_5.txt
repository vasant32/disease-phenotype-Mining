Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced gene 3 (EBI3) is expressed by tumour cells in several EBV-associated malignancies. EBI3 was recently found to associate with a novel peptide, p28, to form a new heterodimeric cytokine, called interleukin-27. In this study, we investigated EBI3 and p28 expression in normal human B lymphocytes and in non-EBV-associated B-cell lymphomas. Low levels of EBI3 were detected in purified tonsillar B cells and expression was upregulated upon anti-CD40 or anti-micro stimulation via NF-kappaB activation. In non-neoplastic tissues, EBI3 expression by lymphocytes was largely restricted to a subset of germinal centre (GC) B cells located at the margin of the light zone, in close contact with CD3+ T lymphocytes. Over 50% of EBI3+ GC B cells were engaged in cell proliferation as assessed by Ki67 expression, and 10-30% expressed MUM1, an early marker of plasma cell differentiation expressed by late centrocytes. Many EBI3+ GC B cells had downregulated bcl-6 expression, which further suggests that these cells correspond to late CD40-activated centrocytes. Immunohistochemical analysis of 64 B-cell lymphomas showed that the highest EBI3 levels were detected in follicular lymphomas and in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas of both GC B-cell-like or non-GC B-cell-like types. No or rare p28 expression was detected in normal or tumour B cells. This constitutive expression of EBI3 by neoplastic B cells may be involved in lymphomagenesis, and may be a useful marker for lymphoma diagnosis.
