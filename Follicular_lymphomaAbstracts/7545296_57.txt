In the tumor-bearing host, T cells invariably fail to induce a clinically significant antitumor immune response. Although model systems support the existence of tumor peptide antigens, the molecular interactions critical for antigen presentation by the tumor cell remain unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that human follicular lymphoma cells are highly inefficient at presenting alloantigen despite their strong expression of major histocompatibility complex and low-to-intermediate expression of some adhesion and B7 costimulatory molecules. Activation of follicular lymphoma cells via CD40 induces or up-regulates both adhesion and B7 costimulatory molecules essential to repair this defect. More importantly, once primed, alloreactive T cells efficiently recognize unstimulated follicular lymphoma cells. Thus, correction of defective tumor immunity requires not only expression of major histocompatibility complex but also sufficient expression of multiple adhesion and costimulatory molecules.
