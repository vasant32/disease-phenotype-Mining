Twice-weekly bortezomib has proven activity in mantle cell (MCL) and indolent lymphomas. This study explored a weekly schedule of bortezomib in follicular lymphoma (FL) and MCL. Although weekly bortezomib was better tolerated, the overall response rate (ORR) was inferior (18% vs. 50%, P = 0.02) with no complete remissions (CR) (compared with 18% CR for the twice-weekly schedule). Progression-free survival (PFS) was not different. The weekly schedule of bortezomib was less toxic, but yielded fewer and lower quality responses than twice-weekly bortezomib. Given the similar PFS, the weekly schedule may still be appropriate for some patients.
