 PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to compare the molecular response (MR) rates of 2 regimens, central lymphatic irradiation (CLI) and alternating triple therapy (ATT), in the treatment of Stage I-III follicular lymphoma. MR was defined as disappearance of t(14;18) (q32;q21) amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-five patients with Stage I to III follicular lymphoma were randomized. CLI consisted of the mantle, abdomen, and pelvic radiation fields. ATT alternated among CHOD-Bleo, ESHAP, and NOPP for 12 courses. Bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples were obtained before treatment for PCR analysis. PCR-positive patients were followed by PCR analysis. The random-effects logistic model was fitted to the data from the posttreatment PCRs. The factors included in the model were treatment arm, type of PCR (BM vs. PB), and time to PCR sample procurement from the date of registration. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 71 months, the 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rates were 45% and 54% for CLI and ATT, respectively (p = 0.42). The probability of attaining an MR increased with time after registration (p = 0.007), was lower for BM compared with PB (p = 0.012), and was higher for ATT than for CLI (p = 0.020). CONCLUSION: ATT regimen achieved a higher MR than CLI, although both arms had similar 5-year RFS.
