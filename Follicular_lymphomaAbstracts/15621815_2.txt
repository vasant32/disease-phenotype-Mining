We describe successful treatment of a 38-year-old patient with composite lymphoma stage IV(A), who presented with multifocal enlarged lymph nodes. The lymph node histology showed classic morphologic features of Hodgkin's disease, mixed cellularity subtype and follicular B-cell lymphoma. Immunophenotypic analysis showed immunoreactivity for CD20, CD10 and Ki-67 in the malignant small cell population. The areas of Hodgkin's disease demonstrated positive immunoreactivity for CD30 and CD20 in the Hodgkin's cells. Both cell populations were bcl2-oncoprotein positive. Eight courses of dose-escalated BEACOPP were administered. Restaging after chemotherapy showed radiological partial remission, but biopsy confirmed persisting follicular B-cell lymphoma without bone marrow infiltration and no evidence of Hodgkin's disease. He was treated with monoclonal CD 20-antibody (Rituximab) 10 mg/kg weekly for eight consecutive weeks due to marked positivity of CD 20-antigen in follicular lymphoma cells. This treatment was well tolerated and final staging showed complete remission of the composite lymphoma. This patient continues to be in remission 28 months after the end of the treatment. In conclusion, in the very rare case of composite lymphoma a combination of chemotherapy and subsequent immunotherapy might be considered as a promising therapeutic option.
