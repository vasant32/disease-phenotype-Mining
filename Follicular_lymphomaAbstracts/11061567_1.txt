The majority of the t(14;18) chromosome translocations that occur in non-Hodgkin centroblastic-centrocytic follicular lymphoma can be detected by various methods. During the translocation process the bcl-2 gene located on chromosome 18 (18q21) is translocated to the JH region of the immunoglobulin gene of chromosome 14 (14q32). The most frequent type of bcl-2 translocations is the mbr type, whereas the immunoglobulin gene breaks mainly at the JH1-6 exons. About one of the 10(5) cells bearing the translocation can already be detected by using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Eight patients suffering from follicular lymphoma were included in this study, which considered the usefulness of the PCR method. The results are in good agreement with those obtained by conventional diagnostic methods. Translocation can be detected, however, in patients with non-malignant diseases such as Sjögren's syndrome (about 5% of the patients) and in a patient with Whipple disease. In addition, translocation was detected in lymphocytes of peripheral blood of a healthy donor. Since lymphomas are detected in patients with Sjögren's syndrome with a relative high frequency, an early diagnosis of the translocation could improve the treatment of the disease. Nevertheless, a diagnosis of lymphoma is valid only in cases of bone marrow translocation-positivity.
