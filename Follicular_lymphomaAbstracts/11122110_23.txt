Using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), aberrations in DNA copy number were studied before and after transformation of follicular lymphoma to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in six patients (15 lymph node biopsies in total). The most common and also the most discrete and intense amplification occurring in four out of 15 biopsies from three different patients was of 2p13-16. Using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR), REL amplification was found to be implicated at this locus. This technique also identified amplified REL in a further two biopsies, presumably below the detection level of CGH. REL amplification was quantified by comparing it, in most cases, with three endogenous reference genes, albumin, beta2-microglobulin and CD8alpha, that lie close to REL on 2p. There was no correlation apparent between 2p13-16 amplification or REL amplification and transformation. This study shows the usefulness of coupling CGH, for detecting recurring abnormalities, with the real-time PCR technique for rapid gene dosage quantification and confirms that the REL gene is a potential candidate in the pathogenesis of a particular subset of follicular lymphomas.
