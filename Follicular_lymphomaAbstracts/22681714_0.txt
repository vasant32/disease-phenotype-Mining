Juvenile xanthogranuloma is a non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis that typically affects children, but several cases have been reported in adults, some in connection with hematologic malignancies. We present the case of a 61-year-old woman with multiple xanthogranulomas who developed a follicular lymphoma after 4 years of follow-up. After 6 months of treatment with chemotherapy and rituximab, the cutaneous lesions disappeared and the patient achieved remission from lymphoma. We highlight this case because xanthogranuloma is a rare disorder that is difficult to diagnose in adults and also because this is the first report of an association between xanthogranuloma and follicular lymphoma. Excellent response was achieved with chemotherapy and rituximab. Finally, given the possible association between xanthogranulomas and hematologic diseases, these lesions may be a cutaneous manifestation of an occult malignancy.
