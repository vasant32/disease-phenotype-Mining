Forty-nine patients with biopsy-proven Waldeyer's ring lymphoma were treated with radiation therapy between 1968 and 1979; 45 to 50 Gy were given to Waldeyer's ring structures with a 5- to 10-Gy boost to the primary site. Uninvolved low cervical nodes received 40 to 50 Gy. Chemotherapy was reserved for treatment failures. Actuarial 5-year survival was 53%, disease-free survival was 48%, and local control was 98%. Patients with Stage I disease fared better than patients with Stage II disease, and unilateral adenopathy conferred a better prognosis than bilateral adenopathy. When classified by the Rappaport system, nodular lymphomas had a better prognosis than diffuse lymphomas, and of the diffuse lymphomas, histiocytic lymphoma was a more lethal disease than lymphocytic lymphoma. Patients with diffuse undifferentiated lymphomas in the Rappaport system, or high-grade lymphomas in the Working Formulation, fared poorly. Most relapses were systemic, and actuarial 5-year survival after salvage was only 20%. A logical approach to the treatment of this disease can be based on these prognostic features.
