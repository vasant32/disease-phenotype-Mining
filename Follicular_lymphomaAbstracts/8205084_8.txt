The value of high-dose chemotherapy with hematologic stem cell rescue has not been established in the treatment of low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We report the results of a retrospective 'France Autogreffe' study of 42 patients grafted in first partial remission (n = 13) or chemosensitive relapse (n = 29) for follicular lymphoma before January 1990. The median age was 38 years (range 26-61 years). Preparative therapy was chemotherapy alone in 22 patients and total body irradiation (TBI)-containing regimens in 20 patients. Thirty-seven patients received hematopoietic marrow stem cells. Bone marrow purging was performed in 15 patients. Five patients received peripheral blood stem cells. Three patients died of bone marrow transplantation toxicity and two others died in complete remission 10 months after autologous bone marrow transplantation. With a median follow-up of 43 months, relapse-free survival is 60%, event-free survival 58% and overall survival 83%. To date no prognostic factors have been shown.
