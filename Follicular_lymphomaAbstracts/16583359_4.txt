Marginal zone differentiation of follicular lymphomas (FL), sometimes referred to as monocytoid B-cell differentiation, is a relatively uncommon phenomenon. Recently, this type of differentiation was also linked to secondary cytogenetic aberrations of chromosome 3 in a small number of patients. We have analysed 131 primary nodal FL with t(14;18)(q32;q21) for secondary cytogenetic aberrations previously described as recurrent in marginal zone lymphomas (MZL) to identify their frequency and possible association with morphological evidence of marginal zone differentiation. We searched for trisomy of chromosomes 3, 12, and 18, gains of chromosome arm 3q, deletions of chromosome arm 7p, structural anomalies with break-points in 1q21 and 1p34, as well as the t(1;2)(p22;p12), t(1;14)(p22;q32), t(3;14)(q27;q32), t(6;14)(p21;q32), and t(11;18)(q21;q21) translocations. At least focal morphological evidence of marginal zone differentiation occurred in 35/131 (27%) FL with t(14;18)(q32;q21) as the primary chromosomal abnormality. None of the recurrent balanced translocations characteristic of extranodal MZL were seen secondarily in the nodal FLs with t(14;18)(q32;q21). However, 43/131 (33%) cases had at least one of the above secondary cytogenetic aberrations previously reported as recurrent aberrations in MZL and, when combined, these were significantly more frequent in FL with morphological evidence of marginal zone differentiation (p<0.0001, two-sided Fisher's exact test). Aberrations of chromosome 3 and, in particular, trisomy 3 occurred frequently in FL with marginal zone differentiation (p=0.002 and p<0.0001, respectively, two-sided Fisher's exact test), while chromosome 21, 22, and X chromosome aberrations, which have not been described previously as recurrent in MZL, were also significantly associated with marginal zone differentiation in FL (p=0.002, p=0.037, p=0.039, respectively, two-sided Fisher's exact test).
