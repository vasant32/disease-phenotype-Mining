This study reports cytomorphological, histomorphological, and immunological characterization of 608 biopsy cases of canine malignant lymphoma, with epidemiological and clinical data, collected from 7 French veterinary pathology laboratories. It compares morphological characteristics of malignant lymphoma in canines, per the updated Kiel classification system, with those reported in humans, per the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system. Of tumors described, 24.5% and 75.5% were classified as low- and high-grade malignant lymphomas, respectively. Presenting clinical signs included generalized or localized lymphadenopathy (82.4%) and extranodal diseases (17.6%) involving the skin (12.34%) and other sites (5.26%). Immunohistochemistry confirmed 63.8% B-cell (CD3-, CD79a+), 35.4% T-cell (CD3+, CD79a-), and 0.8% null-cell (CD3-, CD79a-) lymphomas. Most B-cell cases (38.49%) were of high-grade centroblastic polymorphic subtype; most T-cell cases (8.55%), high-grade pleomorphic mixed and large T-cell lymphoma subtypes. Some B-cell tumors showed morphologic characteristics consistent with follicular lymphomas and marginal zone lymphomas per the Revised European American Classification of Lymphoid Neoplasms and WHO canine classification systems and the WHO human classification system. Unusual high-grade B-cell subtypes included an atypical high-grade small B-cell lymphoma (0.66%), Burkitt-type B-cell lymphoma (1.64%), plasmacytoid lymphoma (0.99%), and mediastinal anaplastic large B-cell lymphoma (0.16%). Unusual T-cell subtypes included a previously undescribed high-grade canine immunoblastic T-cell type (1.15%), a rare low-grade prolymphocytic T-cell lymphoma (0.16%), and a recently described high-grade canine T-cell entity--aggressive granulocytic large-cell lymphoma (0.16%). Marginal zone lymphomas were common (10.86%); follicular lymphomas were rare (0.49%). Canine primary cutaneous malignant lymphoma subtypes were present (11.84%). There was no significant difference between B- and T-cell malignant lymphoma in regard to canine age and sex. A significant overrepresentation of Boxers (24.19%) was found for T-cell lymphomas.
