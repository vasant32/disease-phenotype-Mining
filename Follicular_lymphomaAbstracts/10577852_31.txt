PURPOSE: Classical Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma occasionally occur in the same patient. To clarify whether these different diseases share a common precursor cell, we analyzed the immunoglobulin rearrangements in tumor cells of the classical Hodgkin's disease and the follicular lymphoma that developed in the same patient 2 years apart. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of rearranged immunoglobulin genes was carried out on single Reed-Sternberg cells and on whole tissue DNA extracted from the follicular lymphoma. PCR products were sequenced and compared with each other and with germ line immunoglobulin variable segments. Immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain transcripts were analyzed by radioactive in-situ hybridization. RESULTS: The same monoclonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangement was found in both neoplasms. The variable region of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes of the Reed-Sternberg and of the follicular lymphoma cells were differently mutated, but six somatic mutations were shared by both lymphoma cells. Although the coding capacity of the immunoglobulin genes was preserved in both neoplastic cell populations, immunoglobulin heavy- (mu) and light- (kappa) chain expression was restricted to the follicular lymphoma cells, except for small amounts of kappa light-chain mRNA in some Reed-Sternberg cells. CONCLUSIONS: The neoplastic cells of the Hodgkin's disease and the follicular lymphoma that occurred in this patient derived from a common precursor B cell. Its differentiation stage could be identified as that of a germinal center B cell. Thus, transforming events can be more important than the cell of origin in determining a disease entity.
