Concomitant adenocarcinoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, both located in the intestinal tract, are unusual. We report a unique case of moderately differentiated of the cecum and a simultaneous follicular lymphoma, Grade 1, of the terminal ileum and regional lymph nodes in a 55-yr-old man. One lymph node was involved by both adenocarcinoma and follicular lymphoma. To our knowledge, this is the fifteenth reported case of concurrent adenocarcinoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the intestine, but this is the first case with involvement of follicular lymphoma and adenocarcinoma within the same lymph node.
