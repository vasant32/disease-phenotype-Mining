Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) with nodular growth patterns are very rare, with only 17 cases reported previously. Here, we report a case of PTCL with a nodular growth pattern. The patient was an 81-year-old Japanese woman who complained of malaise, fever and generalized lymph node swelling. Cervical lymph node biopsy was performed, and histological examination revealed proliferation of medium- to large-sized atypical lymphoid cells with indented to irregular nuclei, distinct nucleoli and clear cytoplasm. The nodular growth pattern of the lymphoma cells was obvious. On immunohistochemistry, the atypical lymphoid cells proved to be of T-helper cell origin (CD2+CD3CD4+CD5+CD7+ CD8-CD10-CD25-CD30-CD57-). Polymerase chain reaction analysis of the T-cell receptor gamma-chain revealed a monoclonal rearrangement band. This unusual growth pattern should be distinguished among PTCL, as such cases could be confused with reactive nodular hyperplasia, nodular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma with nodular colonization.
