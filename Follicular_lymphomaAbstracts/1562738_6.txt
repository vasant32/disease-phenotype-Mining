The presence of the translocation t(8;14)(q24;q32) has not been well described in follicular lymphoma (FL). In a consecutive series of 278 karyotypically abnormal non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), six patients with FL showing a t(8;14) without a t(14;18)(q32;q21) were identified. They ranged in age from 45 to 73 years. The cell type was mixed in four patients, small-cleaved in one, and large-cleaved in one; four cases also contained diffuse areas. All cases tested displayed monoclonal surface Ig. The clinical courses were consistent with the histologic subtypes, being less aggressive than other t(8;14)-bearing NHL. In five cases, frozen tissue was available for Southern blotting. The BCL2 gene showed a germline configuration when studied with the MBR, MCR, and 5' cDNA probes. The MYC gene also appeared unrearranged using an exon-1 probe with EcoRI or HindIII digestion. Analysis of the Ig heavy chain (IgH) gene with a JH region probe and BamHI or EcoRI digestion showed only one rearranged band in all cases, indicating that the 14q32 breakpoint did not lie in either the J or switch-mu (SM) regions. In four cases, the exon-1/intron-1 border of the MYC gene, a target area for point mutations in cases of t(8;14) that do not display rearrangements of the MYC gene, was enzymatically amplified and sequenced; no point mutations were identified. The indolent behavior of our six cases, and the finding that the molecular structure of the t(8;14) in these cases does not follow the pattern of breakpoint sites and point mutations defined in other histologic subtypes of NHL with this translocation, suggest that the t(8;14) in these cases is cytogenetically and molecularly distinct from the t(8;14) seen in high-grade NHLs, and is relatively ineffectual in terms of MYC deregulation, or that other genetic elements at these chromosomal sites may be involved. Further analysis of these tumors may provide insights into MYC deregulation and BCL2-independent FL.
