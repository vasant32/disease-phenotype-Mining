The results of T- and B-cell determinations are described in 105 cases of lymphoreticular and lymphoepithelial neoplasia, and are compared to similar investigations of 582 cases as published in the literature. In addition, T- and B-cell values are determined in blood of 35 healthy individuals, in 12 normal lymph nodes, as well as in hyperplastic conditions of lymph nodes from 30 patients and of tonsils from 85 patients. Cell characterizations are done by immunofluorescence and use of monospecific anti-immunoglobulin antisera (H chain specific), anti-thymus antiserum, as well as by the E-rosette test. While normal blood and normal and hyperplastic tissues show a polyclonal distribution or proliferation of lymphoreticular cells, neoplastic conditions are often characterized by an exuberant, possibly monoclonal proliferation of one cell type. According to this, lymphoreticular neoplasias are immunologically grouped into four main classes: B-cell neoplasias comprising most of the chronic lymphocytic leukemias, well differentiated lymphocytic lymphomas, BURKITT's tumor, follicular lymphoma BRILL-SYMMERS, and hairy cell leukemia. T-cell lymphomas represent a large part of poorly or undifferentiated leukemias of children, poorly differentiated lymphocytic lymphomas, prolymphocytic leukemia, and SÃ©zary's syndrome. Monocytic neoplasias are malignant histiocytoses and leukemic reticuloendothelioses. A fourth group, which probably is not homogeneous and might be further classified in the future by use of more sophisticated methods, consists of tumors with T- and B-cell lack. Such tumors are histologically classified as Hodgkin's lymphomas, a certain number of histiocytic lymphomas, and mycosis fungoides. The prognostic and pathogenetic implications of a combined morphological and immunological classification of lymphoreticular neoplasias are briefly outlined.
