Genetic markers for leukemias and lymphomas include chromosomal translocations and antigen-receptor gene rearrangements. Clonal rearrangements of immunoglobulin or T cell receptor (TCR) genes reflect clonal proliferations of lymphocytes, a characteristic feature of lymphoid neoplasia. These rearrangements can be detected as described in this unit by Southern blot hybridization or, in many instances, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Specific chromosomal translocations can also serve as markers for clonality, for malignant transformation, and for various defined subtypes of hematopoietic cancers. PCR protocols are described for detection of the two most commonly assayed translocations, t(9;22) of chronic myelogenous leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and t(14;18) of follicular lymphomas.
