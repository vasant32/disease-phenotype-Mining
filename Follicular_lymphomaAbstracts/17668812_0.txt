 INTRODUCTION: Non Hodgkin's lymphomas quite often present in the head and neck region and after squamous cell carcinoma are the second most common neoplasm of this area. The most predominant localization for extranodal NHL in the head and neck region is the tonsil. The vast majority of NHL at this site are B-cell lymphomas, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, extranodal marginal zone B-cell of MALT type. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The authors presented the case of primary extranodal non Hodgkin's lymphoma of the right tonsil in patient with the long history of chronic tonsillitis and after bilateral tonsillectomy. The affected tonsil together with enlarged lymph node was surgically removed. The histologic examination detected follicular (nodular) non Hodgkin's lymphoma, grade 3. The patient was refered to the Hematology and Oncology Department for additional treatment. RESULTS: In the Hematology and Oncology Department staging was conducted recognizing lymphoma--clinical stage I according to Ann Arbor. The patient was treated with R-COP regiment (six cycles rituximab + COP- cyclophosphamid, vincristin, prednisolon). The complete remission was achieved. The patient is in observation period both in Otolaryngology and Hematology Department. CONCLUSION: Recurrent, non-typical chronic tonsillitis with enlarged neck nodes may be follicular lymphoma's symptom, especially in older patients.
