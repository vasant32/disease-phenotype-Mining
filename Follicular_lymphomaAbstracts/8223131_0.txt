A study was conducted in four regions of China (Suzhou, Nanjing, Qingdao and Shenyang) during the period of 18 months from Dec. 1984 to June 1986, trying to find out the characteristic features of histo- and immuno-pathology of malignant lymphomas in China and relationship with HTLV-1. Fresh specimens were collected from 209 lymphoma patients who were all newly diagnosed. There were 25 cases of Hodgkin's disease (12%), and the other 184 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (88%). These 184 cases were classified according to the Working Formulation proposed by the National Cancer Institute of USA. It was found that low grade group was 5.4% and intermediate and high grade were 48.9% and 38.0%, respectively. Follicular lymphoma was 4.3% and lymphoma of small lymphocytic type was 2.7%. Fourteen cases (7.6%) were pleomorphic type mimicking adult T-cell lymphoma reported by Japanese. Immunotyping was carried out in 162 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The tumors with T-cell markers were 33.9%, B-cell markers 62.4%, and non-T, non-B markers 3.7%. The frequency of T-cell lymphoma cases varied from area to area. Suzhou was 45.8%, Nanjing 57.9%, Qingdao 44.4% and shenyang 11.3%. In the group studied there were only 3 cases showed HTLV-1 positive in serum with pleomorphic morphology and T-cell markers. Our findings indicate that composition of histopathologic types of malignant lymphoma in China is different from that in western countries, and the incidence of T-cell lymphoma is high in certain areas of the lower reaches of the Yangzi River.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
