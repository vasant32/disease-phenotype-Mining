Clinical, histological features and outcome of a cohort of patients with orbital and adnexal lymphoproliferative tumors were evaluated. Twenty-five cases in an oncologic referral center from 1995 to 2008, were included in the study. Each case had detailed immunophenotypic analysis using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (CD45, CD20, CD3, CD5, CD23, BCL2, BCL6, BCL10, Ki67, CD30, CD15, BCL1, Kappa, Lambda, CD138). Lesions were classified by using WHO (2008) lymphomas classification. Twenty-three patients were found to have primary and two secondary lymphomas. Histological subtypes were: 16 patients with marginal zone B cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, four diffuse large B cell lymphomas, two mantle cell lymphomas, two follicular lymphomas, and one Hodgkin lymphoma. Among the 25 patients studied, 22 had localized stage. Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma was the most frequent type of primary orbital and adnexal lymphoma. In this study localized disease was observed in most cases, and distant spread of the lymphomas was infrequent.
