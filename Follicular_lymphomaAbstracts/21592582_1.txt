We present a rare case of chronic Pneumocystis jiroveci infection presenting as multiple persistent granulomatous pulmonary nodules over a 12 month period in a patient with follicular lymphoma undergoing treatment with Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine, and Prednisolone chemotherapy. Remarkably during this period the patient remained asymptomatic. This is the first case to combine these atypical histological, radiological, and clinical manifestations of P. jiroveci infection highlighting unusual manifestations of the disease.
