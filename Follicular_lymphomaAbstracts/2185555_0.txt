A 47-year old man had hypersplenism from massive splenomegaly, the cause of which was undetermined for 2 years. He was initially asymptomatic though there was mild pancytopenia. However, 18 months after presentation he manifested both clinical and haematological deterioration, almost succumbing to sepsis. Splenectomy finally provided a definite diagnosis of follicular lymphoma and also restored his blood counts to within normal range.
