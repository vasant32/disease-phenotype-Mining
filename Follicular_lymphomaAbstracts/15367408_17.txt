BACKGROUND: Different prognostic scores have been proposed to predict the outcome of follicular lymphoma (FL) patients at diagnosis. A new prognostic index specifically addressing FL patients, the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI), has recently been developed, which might also be useful in patients with progression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and three patients (55 male, 48 female; median age 59 years) with FL in first relapse/progression after an initial response to therapy (50 complete responders/ 53 partial responders) were included in the study. RESULTS: Five-year survival from progression (SFP) was 55% (95% confidence interval 44%-66%). The distribution according to the FLIPI at relapse was 39% good prognosis, 24% intermediate prognosis and 37% poor prognosis. Five-year SFP for these groups were 85%, 79% and 28%, respectively (P < 0.0001). Other variables at relapse with prognostic significance for SFP were age, presence of B symptoms, performance status, bulky disease, number of involved nodal sites, lactate dehydrogenase level, hemoglobin level, histological transformation, the Italian Lymphoma Intergroup prognostic index for FL and the International Prognostic Index for aggressive lymphomas. In the multivariate analysis bulky disease (P=0.01), presence of B symptoms (P=0.03) and FLIPI at relapse (P=0.0003) were the most important variables for predicting SFP. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with FL at first relapse/progression, the FLIPI, along with the presence of bulky disease and B symptoms, are features that predict SFP and thus could be useful to select candidates for experimental treatments.
