The distribution of Bcl-2 oncoprotein was studied immunohistochemically in formaldehyde-fixed and paraffin-embedded reactive and neoplastic lymphoid tissue. The potential of Bcl-2 for the differential diagnosis of follicular lesions was emphasized, and the results on follicular lesions were correlated with those of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement. In hyperplastic lymphoid tissue, Bcl-2 reactivity was widespread, including germinal center surroundings, scattered cells within the germinal centers, and the T-cell areas in general. Distinctively negative lymphoid populations included the majority of germinal center cells, and the negative staining pattern was maintained in cases of florid hyperplasia. In contrast, follicular lymphoma cells were consistently Bcl-2 positive. The immunohistochemical Bcl-2 reactivity of lymphoma follicles correlated with the clonal PCR amplification pattern of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene; all Bcl-2-negative hyperplasias revealed a non-clonal pattern. Clusters of monocytoid B cells were Bcl-2 negative, whereas monocytoid B-cell lymphomas and closely related MALT lymphomas were positive. All other small cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of B-cell types showed nearly uniform Bcl-2 reactivity, whereas large cell B-cell lymphomas were variably positive (74%). In Hodgkin's cells, Bcl-2 reactivity was seen in the neoplastic populations of most cases of nodular sclerosis and mixed cellularity types, whereas the L&H and Reed-Sternberg cells in lymphocyte predominance Hodgkin's disease were negative in most cases. Bcl-2 immunohistochemistry thus appears very valuable in the differential diagnosis of follicular hyperplasia and neoplasia, and it may help to distinguish between reactive and neoplastic monocytoid B cells. However, Bcl-2 immunohistochemistry is not useful in the subtyping of B-cell lymphomas.
