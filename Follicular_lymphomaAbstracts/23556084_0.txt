 BACKGROUND: The impact on health related quality of life (HRQoL) of rituximab maintenance (R-M) versus observation (OBS) after induction for treatment of follicular lymphoma (FL) is unclear. METHODS: We reviewed the charts of 137 patients (53% female, 87% White, age 61.0 ± 12.4 years) who received either R-M (n = 53) or OBS (n = 84) after chemotherapy induction for newly diagnosed FL at community oncology practices within the US. Patients (65% with advanced disease; 48% with a high FLIPI score [3-5]) had completed ≥1 Patient Care Monitor HRQoL survey in the period following front-line therapy, and were excluded if they had progressed during front-line therapy. RESULTS: Linear mixed models showed that postinduction, most symptoms were stable, with patients on R-M reporting HRQoL that was equal to that reported by OBS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Among R-M patients, receipt of rituximab was associated with improved psychological symptoms.
