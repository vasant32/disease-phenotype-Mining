Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a common subtype of low grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Although this form of lymphoma often pursues an indolent course, in some cases it may behave in a more aggressive manner. Clinical and histological parameters have been shown to correlate with an adverse prognosis but a number of cytogenetic abnormalities may also be associated with aggressive disease. Although, the t(14;18) in itself does not affect outcome in cases of FL, secondary abnormalities that occur in a complex polyploid karyotype may identify cases with a poor prognosis. It is unusual to find both t(14;18) and C-MYC translocation in the same tumour; those cases in which it has been described include examples of high-grade B-cell NHL (either de novo or transformed FL) or B-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma. In this report, three cases of FL are described in which both t(14;18) and a C-MYC translocation were identified at presentation. We also summarize four further cases from the literature. This is a small series but one which raises the possibility that the presence of a C-MYC translocations at presentation may identify a particularly aggressive subtype of FL. Further studies are required to investigate the true incidence of this aberration, the impact on C-MYC regulation, clinical course and response to treatment.
