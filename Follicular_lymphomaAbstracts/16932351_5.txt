This study provides an updated report of the consecutive multicenter Gruppo Italiano Trapianto Midollo Osseo trial employing an intensified, purging-free, total body irradiation-free, high-dose sequential chemotherapy schedule with peripheral blood stem cell autograft (i-HDS) in advanced-stage follicular lymphoma (FL). Special interest has been devoted to late toxicities and outcome in terms of molecular status. Ninety-two untreated FL patients aged <or=60 were enrolled by 20 Italian centers and evaluated on an intention-to-treat basis. Main findings are as follows: (1) 5.5-years overall survival projection of 80% (median follow-up: 68 months), with no differences related to age-adjusted IPI score; (2) 46 (50%) of 92 patients presently in continuous complete remission; (3) projected long-term progression-free survival exceeding 80% for patients collecting PCR-negative stem cell harvests or achieving molecular remission within the first 2 years from the end of therapy; (4) actuarial 5-years risk of developing secondary myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia of 3.7%, with most of these events occurring in patients re-treated for recurrent lymphoma. These results demonstrate that i-HDS is feasible, effective and safe even in terms of long-term outcome. As the HDS schedule can be easily supplemented with Rituximab, it is one of the best options for random comparison with Rituximab-supplemented conventional chemotherapy.
