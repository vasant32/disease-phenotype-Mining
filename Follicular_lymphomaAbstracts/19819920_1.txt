Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) combines the use of targeted monoclonal antibodies with radionuclides for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), taking advantage of its inherent radiosensitivity. A number of trials have shown significantly higher response rates and longer progression-free survival times in patients treated with the CD20-targeted radioimmunoconjugate yttrium-90-ibritumomab tiuxetan compared with the standard of care. Furthermore, these benefits have also been shown in heavily pretreated patients who relapsed or were resistant to rituximab. Currently, a number of different treatment regimens and strategies are available for the treatment of NHL patients. Therefore, in an attempt to minimize toxicity, maximize efficacy, and improve survival, it is crucial to appropriately select patients who are good candidates for individual treatment approaches. A strategy for patient selection has been developed, including the use of existing patient assessment tools, such as the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index, to determine the optimal regimen for patients with follicular lymphoma according to their disease characteristics and physical condition. Patients who are fit make ideal candidates for potentially curative regimens, which include induction chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy followed by RIT consolidation and, potentially, maintenance therapy. Patients who are considered "compromised" would also benefit from induction treatment and RIT consolidation, with a view to reducing the lymphoma burden and decreasing the risk for disease progression. "Frail" patients would be better suited to supportive therapy to control symptoms. This paper explores factors that should be considered when assessing whether a patient is a good candidate for treatment with RIT, and aids physicians in the selection of the most appropriate therapy for each patient group.
