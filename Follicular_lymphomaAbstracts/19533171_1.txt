 PURPOSE: Although survival has been studied for various subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), there have been few comprehensive studies to quantify the prognosis, including all specific histologies. The effect of family history on survival in NHL has not been examined. METHODS: We used the Swedish Family-Cancer Database to estimate hazard ratios in NHL by histology and family history. RESULTS: Using diffuse centroblastic lymphoma as reference (HR 1.0), patients with Waldenstr√∂m's macroglobulinemia and hairy-cell leukemia had the best survival. Survival advantage was also noted among patients with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and different kinds of follicular lymphomas. For T-cell lymphoma, mycosis fungoides showed a favorable prognosis. As for survival by family history, a total of 98 familial cases were noted in our Database with a similar prognosis compared to sporadic cases in both parental and offspring generations. A non-significant familial concordance of either good or poor survival was noted among family members when probands' prognosis was stratified by survival time. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide quantitative prognosis data for patients with NHL according to specific histologies. Patients with a familial NHL had a similar prognosis compared to patients with sporadic disease. The data suggest familial concordance in either good or poor survival among family members.
