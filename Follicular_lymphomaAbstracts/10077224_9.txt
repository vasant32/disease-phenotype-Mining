New insights into the pathogenesis of lymphoid malignancies have been gained through novel techniques such as genetic, molecular and immunologic methods. Recently, based on those findings, a new classification system for lymphoid malignancies, known as the REAL classification, has been proposed. To clarify the relation between the histological classification and prognosis of B-cell lymphoid malignancies, we re-classified 708 cases. In all cases, the B-cell phenotype and/or genotype was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining and/or receptor gene analysis. The most common B-cell lymphoma types were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (58.8%), follicular lymphoma (12.1%), marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) (9.0%) and mantle cell lymphoma (5.9%). Minor types were lymphoblastic lymphoma (3.4%), Burkitt's lymphoma (2.4%), nodal marginal zone lymphoma (2.1%), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (2.0%) and plasmacytoma (1.4%). Rare types were prolymphocytic lymphoma and splenic marginal zone lymphoma. Using overall survival rates, the various B-cell lymphoma types could be divided into three broad groups for prognostic purposes: (1) the low risk group consisted of follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma of MALT, nodal marginal zone lymphoma, plasmacytoma and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma; (2) the intermediate risk group consisted of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma; and (3) the high risk group consisted of lymphoblastic lymphoma. In MALT, the low grade type had a better prognosis than the high grade type. In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the common type had a better prognosis than the variant type, which mainly consisted of the immunoblastic lymphoma. The histological classification will have a benefit for the clinical approach.
