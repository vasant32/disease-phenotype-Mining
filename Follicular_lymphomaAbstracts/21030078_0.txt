DCK catalyzes the intracellular phosphorylation of fludarabine. The promoter and coding region of the DCK gene were analyzed in 74 follicular lymphoma (FL) patients receiving a therapeutic regimen that included fludarabine. DCK mRNA expression was quantified in a cohort of healthy donors. Four previously described genotypic variants, -360C>G, -201C>T (rs2306744), C28624T (rs11544786) and c.91+37G>C (rs9997790), as well as the new variant, -12C>G, were identified. Variant C28624T showed a lower risk of lymphopenia (P=0.04), but a higher risk of neutropenia (P=0.04). Statistical significance was found in bivariate logistic regression between lymphopenia and infectious episodes in the induction period (odds ratio 3.85, P=0.04).
