We report our experience with a new real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay applicable for simultaneous quantification and characterization of MBR/JH translocation in follicular lymphomas. This technique, which combines amplification with the FRET probe with SYBR Green I melting curve analysis, allows efficient detection of tumor cells in bone marrow or peripheral blood and their comparison with the original neoplastic clone.
