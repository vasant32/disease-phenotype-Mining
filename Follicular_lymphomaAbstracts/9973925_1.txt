Cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies in a case of follicular lymphoma grade III showed a "jumping translocation" of chromosome 1q21-qter to chromosomes Xq28 and 18q23, which resulted in a partial trisomy 1q as the only chromosome aberration. This case represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first report of a jumping translocation in a malignant lymphoma occurring as the sole aberration.
