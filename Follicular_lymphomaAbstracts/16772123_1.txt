Translocations involving 3q27 that affect the BCL6 gene are common and specific chromosomal abnormalities in B-cell precursor non-Hodgkin lymphoma (mainly diffuse large-cell and follicular lymphoma), but they have not been reported in Burkitt lymphoma. Here, we describe a case in which a BCL6 rearrangement and additional complex cytogenetic abnormalities occurred in a child with Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia and ataxia-telangiectasia. Although cytogenetic analysis of the bone marrow revealed clonal abnormalities of chromosome arms 8q and 14p and other subclonal abnormalities, the t(8;14) or its variants typically associated with Burkitt lymphoma were not observed. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with locus-specific probes and multicolor spectral karyotyping demonstrated a complex pattern of chromosomal rearrangements leading to a subtle t(3;8)(q27;q24.1) that rearranged BCL6 and placed it adjacent to MYC. We speculate that this genetic lesion occurred as a result of chromosomal instability due to the underlying disease.
