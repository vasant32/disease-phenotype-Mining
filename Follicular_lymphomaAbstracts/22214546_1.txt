 Several reports have documented similar efficacies and tolerable toxicities of radioimmunotherapy (RIT) consolidation and rituximab maintenance after initial R-chemotherapy of follicular lymphoma.

We now raise the question whether both RIT consolidation and rituximab maintenance should be used together aiming to augment the results achievable with R-chemotherapy.
