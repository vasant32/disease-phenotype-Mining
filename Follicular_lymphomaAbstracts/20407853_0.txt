Lymphomatous involvement of the gallbladder is extremely rare. We report on a 69-year-old woman with a history of an indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who was found to have a new gallbladder lesion on surveillance CT scan. The mass was resected and proved to be a follicular lymphoma with the same immunohistochemical characteristics as her original tumor 12Â years prior.
