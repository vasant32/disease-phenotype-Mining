The monoclonal antibody Rituximab is useful for treatment of patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We phenotypically analyzed reconstitution of peripheral B cells in a male patient with follicular lymphoma following their depletion with Rituximab. CD19+ and CD20+ B cell counts in peripheral blood decreased rapidly following Rituximab treatment. Six months after the end of treatment, a few CD19+ B cells were detected in peripheral blood. These cells had a naive B cell phenotype (IgD+, CD27-) and they expressed high levels of CD38 and CD24, which show that the B cell pool was repopulated mainly with immature, naive B cells.
