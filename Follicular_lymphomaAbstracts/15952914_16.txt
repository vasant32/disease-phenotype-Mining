FavId (Favrille, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) is a personalized therapeutic vaccine product for B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, custom-manufactured from individual patient's tumour cells. This investigational agent consists of recombinant tumour-specific immunoglobulin (idiotype [Id]) chemically conjugated to the highly immunogenic carrier protein keyhole limpet haemocyanin (Id-KLH). The vaccine product is administered by subcutaneous co-injection with the cytokine adjuvant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) with the goal of stimulating tumour-specific T cell and humoral immunity. Therapeutic Id vaccines have shown promising results in early phase clinical trials in follicular lymphoma, and several Phase III trials are ongoing. FavId's advantages over other Id vaccine formulations include its rapid and efficient manufacturing technology utilising recombinant baculovirus, with a production time of only 8-12 weeks. In Phase II studies, FavId Id-KLH plus GM-CSF vaccines have been found to be safe, immunogenic and clinically active in follicular lymphoma. At present, FavId is being tested in a randomised, placebo-controlled Phase III trial in follicular lymphoma, aimed at improving the time to disease progression when administered following cytoreduction with rituximab. If found to be efficacious in this pivotal trial, FavId would represent a tumour-selective immunotherapy for lymphoma with little toxicity and a novel mechanism of action.
