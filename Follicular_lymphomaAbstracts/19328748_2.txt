A method was developed for the quantification of araCTP, CTP and dCTP in a human follicular lymphoma cell line. This method involves solid phase extraction (SPE) using a weak anion-exchanger (WAX) cartridge, a porous graphitic carbon high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column separation, and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) detection. By using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in negative ion multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, the method was able to achieve a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 0.1 microg mL(-1) for araCTP and of 0.01 microg mL(-1) for both CTP and dCTP. The method was validated and used to determine the amount of araCTP, CTP and dCTP formed after incubation of araC and an araCMP prodrug in the human follicular lymphoma cell line RL.
