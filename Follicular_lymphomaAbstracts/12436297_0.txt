Staging biopsies of the bone marrow in lymphoma patients are among the most important indications and therefore of substantial practical importance. Occasionally it is the only organ infiltrated, and therefore a bone marrow biopsy is the prime diagnostic choice in cases of leukemic lymphomas. A synoptical diagnostic approach relying on immunophenotypic as well as on molecular biological criteria aside from histomorphology (cytomorphology), is of utmost importance for the subtyping of malignant lymphomas. This too can be done reliably on bone marrow biopsies, as comparative studies have yielded a concordance rate of more than 90% with lymphoma typing on corresponding lymph nodes. Cytology and the pattern of infiltrates, (i.e. diffuse, interstitial, nodular peritrabecular and intrasinusoidal), in combination with immunological phenotyping are the mainstays for subtyping, giving clear-cut decisions in most cases of small B-cell lymphoma, mantle zone as well as marginal cell and follicular lymphomas and hairy cell leukemia. Among the blastic variants the most important are the lymphoblastic lymphomas of either B- or T-cell type which have to be discerned from AML and the so-called blastoid mantle cell lymphomas. T-cell lymphomas are rare compared to B-cell lymphomas. Among the rarely seen T-cell neoplasias the lymphoma of large granular lymphocytes is the dominating lymphoma, which in most cases can only be diagnosed reliably by molecular biological means, followed by T-CLL, Sezary's syndrome and hepatosplenic chi delta lymphoma.
