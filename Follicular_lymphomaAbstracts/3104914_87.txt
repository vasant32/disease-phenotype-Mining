To elucidate the mechanism of the t(14;18)(q32;q21) chromosomal translocation found in follicular lymphoma, we examined the structure of both derivative (der) chromosomal breakpoints as well as their germ-line predecessors. We noted that chromosome segment 18q21 was juxtaposed with immunoglobulin heavy (H) chain gene diversity (DH) regions on all five der(18) chromosomes we examined, and we confirmed the juncture with immunoglobulin H-chain gene joining (JH) regions on the der(14) chromosome. However, the t(14;18) was not fully reciprocal in that chromosome 14 DNA between the DH and JH regions was deleted. Furthermore, extra nucleotides, reminiscent of "N" segments, were present at the der(14) and possibly der(18) junctions. This indicates that despite the mature B-cell phenotype of follicular lymphoma, the t(14;18) occurs during attempted DH-JH joining, the earliest event in immunoglobulin rearrangement in a pre-B-cell. Our detailed analysis of the germ-line 18q21 region indicated that most breakpoints clustered within a 150-base-pair major breakpoint region. However, we found no evidence for evolutionarily conserved immunoglobulin-like recombinational signals at 18q21, arguing against a role for immunoglobulin recombinase in chromosome 18 breakage. Instead, a direct repeat duplication of chromosome 18 sequences was discovered at both chromosomal junctures, typical of the repair of a naturally occurring staggered double-stranded DNA break. These results prompt a translocation model with illegitimate pairing of a staggered double-stranded DNA break at 18q21 and an immunoglobulin endonuclease-mediated break at 14q32 and with N-segment addition, repair, and ligation to generate der(14) and der(18) chromosomes.
