Treatment of prostate cancer cell lines expressing bcl-2 with taxol induces bcl-2 phosphorylation and programmed cell death, whereas treatment of bcl-2-negative prostate cancer cells with taxol does not induce apoptosis. bcl-2 phosphorylation seems to inhibit its binding to bax since less bax was observed in immunocomplex with bcl-2 in taxol-treated cancer cells. These findings support the use of the anticancer drug taxol for the treatment of bcl-2-positive prostate cancers and other bcl-2-positive malignancies, such as follicular lymphoma.
