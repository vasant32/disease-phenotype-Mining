The expansion of follicular lymphomas (FLs) resembles, both morphologically and functionally, normal germinal center B-cell growth. The tumor cells proliferate in networks of follicular dendritic cells and are believed to be capable of somatic hypermutation and isotype switching. To investigate the relation between somatic mutation and heavy chain isotype expression, we analyzed the variable heavy (V(H)) chain genes of 30 FL samples of different isotypes. The V(H) genes of the FLs were heavily mutated (29.3 mutations on average). In addition, isotype-switched lymphomas contained more somatic mutations than immunoglobulin M-positive lymphomas (33.8 mutations per V(H) gene versus 23.0, respectively). In all but one of the FLs, the ratios of replacement versus silent mutations in the framework regions were low, independent of the absolute number of somatic mutations and the level of intraclonal variation. Analysis of relapse samples of 4 FLs showed no obvious increase in somatic mutation load in most FLs and a decrease in intraclonal variation in time. In 3 of 4 cases, we obtained evidence for selection of certain subclones, rather than clonal evolution. Our findings question if intraclonal variation is always a reflection of ongoing somatic hypermutation. This may have implications for the concept of antigen-driven lymphomagenesis.
