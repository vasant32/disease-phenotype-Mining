We describe a 50-year-old female patient who developed extensive lymphomatous infiltrates on her forehead, scalp and face within a few months. Histology and immunohistochemistry of skin tumours revealed a CD20 positive follicular B-cell lymphoma. Subsequently, extracutaneous manifestations were detected by computed tomography scans and bone marrow biopsy. The patient suffered from a primary nodular malignant lymphoma with extraordinary cutaneous infiltration of the head. Therefore, combination treatment with a monoclonal antibody against the CD20 antigen, rituximab, and polychemotherapy (CHOP scheme) was administered every 3 weeks. After the second course of treatment a complete regression of cutaneous infiltrates was noticed. Follow-up biopsies on the forehead showed no evidence of CD20 positive lymphoma cells, now. Despite mild leucocytopaenia therapy was well tolerated.
