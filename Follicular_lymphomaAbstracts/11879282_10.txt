PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to review the historical development and recent advances in the application of monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of lymphoma. OVERVIEW: The history of clinical applications of monoclonal antibodies has been intertwined with that of lymphomas. The first report of a complete remission in 1981 described a patient with follicular lymphoma who was treated with a murine anti-idiotype antibody. Later that decade there appeared additional encouraging reports of radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, immunotoxins, and other antibodies with antitumor effects against lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Monoclonal antibodies as a treatment of malignancy became reality in late 1997 when the US Food and Drug Administration approved the anti-CD20 chimeric monoclonal antibody rituximab for the treatment of B-cell lymphoma. Since that time an anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody (dacliximab) and an anti-CD25 immunotoxin fusion product (denileukin diftitox) have become clinically available. Several radio- labeled antibodies, including the murine anti-CD20 products (131)I-tositumomab and (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan, are in advanced stages of clinical testing as are other unlabeled monoclonal antibodies with antilymphoma activity. Other antilymphoma immunotoxins that react with CD25, CD19, and CD22 also have shown promise. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The therapeutic arsenal against lymphoma has been significantly changed by the addition of these antibody products that are active as single agents, and are synergistic, additive, or both with other antilymphoma treatments.
