Recently, the standard treatments for hematological malignancies have shown dramatic improvement. For chronic myeloid leukemia, imatinib has become the treatment of choice in initial treatment, and its long-term effectiveness and safety have been confirmed. For acute myelogenous leukemia, cytarabine with anthracycline agent is believed to be the standard treatment in first remission induction therapy. To improve the efficacy of the first remission induction chemotherapy, the addition of gemutuzumab ozogamicin has been investigated intensively all over the world. However, there are many obstacles to conducting its clinical trial in Japan. The addition of rituximab to CHOP improves the survival of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. For follicular lymphoma patients, rituximab with conventional chemotherapies are considered the standard treatments, but the question of which conventional chemotherapy is better is unsolved. MP therapy had long been the standard treatment for elderly patients with multiple myeloma, but MP therapy plus thalidomide with MP therapy has been found to be superior. In patients who are candidates for autologous stem-cell transplantation, VAD therapy or high-dose dexamethasone therapy followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation is considered the treatment of choice. But the number of transplantations and the timing of second transplantation need more investigation. Considering the overall situation with regard to the standard treatments of hematological malignancies in Japan, there is little difference in practice from western countries. However, the framework of conducting clinical trials to investigate standard treatment in Japan is unsatisfactory.
