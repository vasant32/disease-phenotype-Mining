To study the incidence and clinical significance of bcl-2/JH fusion in 45 Chinese patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect the fusion gene of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. A total of 12 patients gave positive results, they include 9 of the 15 patients with follicular lymphoma and 3 of the 30 patients with diffuse B-cell lymphoma. The results were negative in 5 patients with reactive hyperplasia. The breakpoint was located within the major breakpoint region in 11 of the 12 patients, and the remaining patient had bcl-2 translocation in the minor cluster region. The results of the study show that bcl-2/JH fusion gene in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas is an important molecular biological marker and has a significant role in differentiating benign or malignant hyperplasia, determination of clonality, predicting prognosis and in the discovery of minor residual disease.
