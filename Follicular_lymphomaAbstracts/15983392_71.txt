 PURPOSE: Despite several new treatment options, single- and multi-institution analyses have not clarified whether survival patterns in follicular lymphoma (FL) patients have changed in recent decades. We undertook a study using a large population-based registry to analyze survival patterns among patients with FL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results morphology codes were used to identify 14,564 patients diagnosed with FL between 1978 and 1999. Observed median survival times, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, proportional death hazard ratios, and relative survival rates were calculated. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to identify trends in annual adjusted death hazard ratios. RESULTS: An improvement in survival of all patients with FL was observed between each of three diagnosis eras (1978 to 1985, 1986 to 1992, and 1993 to 1999) by log-rank tests. Among patients with stage-specific data, the median survival time improved from 84 months (95% CI, 81 to 88 months) in the 1983 to 1989 era to 93 months (95% CI, 89 to 97 months) in the 1993 to 1999 era. Similar findings were identified across sex and age groups and for subsets including advanced-stage, large-cell FL and the combined subset of small cleaved- and mixed-cell FL. The inter-era survival advantage observed in white patients was not observed for black patients. The relative risk of death decreased by 1.8% per year over the 1983 to 1999 observation period. CONCLUSION: The survival of patients with FL in the United States has improved over the last 25 years. The survival improvement may be a result of the sequential application of effective therapies and improved supportive care.
