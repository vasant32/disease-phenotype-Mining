Thirty-seven patients with advanced non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who were treated by total-body irradiation (TBI) at the Royal Marsden Hospital are reviewed. Twenty-four patients had received no previous therapy; 13 patients were in relapse. The overall response rate was 73% for nodular lymphomas and 80% for those with diffuse disease. THe duration of complete response ranged from two to 41 months (median 12 months). Subsequent chemotherapy was given successfully except in patients with prolonged thrombocytopenia which appeared to be related to an initially involved bone marrow. Hemibody irradiation (HBI) was the least myelosuppressive form of TBI and is now being used in complete remission following chemotherapy.
