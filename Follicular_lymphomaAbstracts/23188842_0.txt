Follicular lymphomas (FL) are among the most common non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in adults. However, they are rare in children making up less than 3% of paediatric NHL cases. They occur most commonly in the head and neck region, lymph nodes or tonsils, with occasional extra-nodal occurrences. Distinction of FL from potentially clonal but, reactive follicular hyperplasia is important. We report a case of a 6-year-old male child presenting with night stridor since 6 months. Clinical examination revealed asymmetrical enlargement of the left tonsil. Routine left tonsillectomy was performed and the specimen was sent for histopathological examination. Diagnosis of follicular lymphoma was made on histopathological examination and further confirmed by immunohistochemistry.
