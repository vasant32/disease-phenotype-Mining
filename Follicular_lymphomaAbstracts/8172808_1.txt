The proliferative activity and the origin of multinucleated Reed-Sternberg cells and mononuclear variants in Hodgkin's disease have been studied in the past using several techniques. The presence of both proliferating-cell nuclear antigen and the cell-proliferation-associated antigen Ki-67 have also been reported in Hodgkin's disease. P34cdc2 is the protein product of the cell-cycle-control cdc-2 gene. Using a monoclonal antibody against the protein p34, cases of three different histological subtypes of Hodgkin's disease have been studied along with normal tonsil and follicular lymphoma as controls. In all these cases of Hodgkin's disease, positive p34 staining was seen in the majority of Reed-Sternberg cells and mononuclear variants (> 80%), along with a proportion of small lymphocytes, mainly T cells. Staining was predominantly cytoplasmic and occasionally additional nuclear signals were apparent. In two cases, double immunostaining with the anti-p34 antibody and CM-1 for p53 demonstrated positive signals for both proteins within the same neoplastic cells. Although the presence of p34 in Reed-Sternberg or variant cells reflects mitosis and hence suggests proliferation, the possibility of endomitosis remains and may explain the multinucleated appearance of Reed-Sternberg cells.
