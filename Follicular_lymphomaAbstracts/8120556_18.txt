 PURPOSE: Fludarabine is an active agent for patients with low-grade lymphoma (LGL) but has mainly been used as a single agent. This trial was designed to define the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of a combination of fludarabine, mitoxantrone, and dexamethasone (FND), to identify the toxicities of these agents in combination, and to make preliminary observations about the efficacy of this combination. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients with recurrent LGL or follicular large-cell lymphoma were treated, in cohorts of three, at stepwise escalating doses. Patients were required to have adequate marrow function and normal renal, hepatic, and cardiac function. RESULTS: The MTD of the combination was found to be as follows: fludarabine, 25 mg/m2/d (days 1 to 3); mitoxantrone, 10 mg/m2 (day 1); and dexamethasone, 20 mg/d (days 1 to 5). Each course was administered monthly, and up to eight courses were given. Dose-limiting toxicities were neutropenia and infections. Thrombocytopenia was modest. Nonhematologic toxicity was very modest. Responses were seen at every dose level. The overall response rate was 71%, with a 43% complete remission (CR) rate. The median duration of CR was 18 months (with follow-up duration from 13 to 28+ months). CONCLUSION: FND was well tolerated in this population. While our primary aim was to define the MTD, our preliminary observations on the efficacy of the regimen were favorable. The overall response rate was high, there was a high fraction of CRs, and our early impression is that these responses are durable.
