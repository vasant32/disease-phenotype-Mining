In March 2005, a 70-year-old male patient underwent distal gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection for type 3 gastric cancer located in the lower-third of the stomach, and partial gastrectomy for submucosal tumor located in the upper- third of the stomach. A post operative pathological finding of cancer was T2N0P0H0M0 (f-Stage II) and that of submucosal tumor was gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Although the adjuvant chemotherapy of S-1 was administered, it was discontinued because of cerebral infarction. Forty months after the operation, CT scan revealed a left inguinal lymph node swelling and recurrence of gastric cancer was doubted. FDG-PET scan confirmed increased uptake only in one lymph node of left inguinal region. In September 2008, left inguinal lymph node dissection was performed and its pathological finding was follicular lymphoma (grade 1). At present, the patient was doing well and showed no signs of recurrence. However, it is important to follow-up the patient carefully because the relapse rate of follicular lymphoma is comparatively high.
