Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is required for somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR) of the immunoglobulin (Ig) gene. AID has been reported to be specifically expressed in the germinal center (GC). Follicular lymphoma (FL) cells are known to be exposed to GC reaction, as characterized by a high degree of SHM with some heterogeneity in terms of intraclonal microheterogeneity and antigen selection. The heterogeneity of SHM pattern in FL intrigued us to investigate the AID expression. AID expression was investigated in 19 FL materials consisting of 15 cases of FL fresh cells and four cell lines. In all, 10 fresh cells and three cell lines expressed AID, but the others did not. SHM was investigated in 12 fresh cells and four cell lines. The ongoing mutation was significantly different between AID-positive and AID-negative FL fresh cells (unpaired Student's t-test, P=0.047). Ongoing mutation was not seen in any of the cell lines. AID expression was associated with the ongoing mutation in FL fresh cells (two-tailed Pearson's coefficient correlation, r=0.899, P=0.01). The switch off of AID expression may start in the B-lineage differentiation stage counterpart of FL after optimizing SHM, indicated by the cessation of the ongoing mutation in AID-negative FL fresh cells.
