Tumor-specific variable regions of the clonal immunoglobulin (idiotype, Id) expressed by B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) can be targeted by active immunotherapy. We conducted a phase I/II trial to determine the safety and immunogenicity of a patient-specific, recombinant, mammalian cell-derived Id protein conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Id-KLH; MyVax personalised immunotherapy) in 22 patients with follicular NHL in first remission after chemotherapy. Subjects received five subcutaneous immunisations with MyVax plus locally administered granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Among 21 evaluable patients, 62% mounted Id-specific immune responses. Evoked anti-Id antibodies recognised both recombinant Id and native Id, and could specifically stain autologous tumor cells. At median follow-up of more than 6 years, median progression-free survival is 38 months. Immunisation of follicular lymphoma patients with MyVax Id-KLH is safe and patients often mount tumor-specific immune responses. These results form the basis of a pivotal phase 3 trial of MyVax in follicular NHL.
