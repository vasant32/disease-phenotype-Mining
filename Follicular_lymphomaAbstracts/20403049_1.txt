Amyloidosis in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is known to be of the AL type, and AA-type amyloidosis in NHL is extremely rare. Herein is reported an autopsy case of follicular lymphoma that transformed to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in a relapse associated with systemic AA amyloidosis. CMV infection in an immunocompromised state with chemotherapy against DLBCL may have been involved in amyloid accumulation. The serum amyloid A (SAA)1 gene polymorphism, SAA1.2/1.3, might have also been another factor in this case, considering the risk of AA amyloidosis in Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
