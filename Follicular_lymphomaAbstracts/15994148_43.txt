 PURPOSE: This multicenter, dose-escalation study evaluates the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of galiximab (anti-CD80 monoclonal antibody) in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients had follicular lymphoma that had relapsed or failed to respond to primary therapy; the majority (90%) presented with stage III or IV disease. Four weekly intravenous infusions of galiximab were administered at doses of 125, 250, 375, or 500 mg/m2. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients received galiximab treatment and were evaluated for safety; 35 were assessable for response. Antibody infusions were safe and well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities. A total of 22 (60%) of 37 patients experienced adverse events related to galiximab. All but one of the events were grade 1 or 2; the most common were fatigue, nausea, and headache. Cytopenias were rare; only one patient experienced anemia and febrile neutropenia, which were unrelated to galiximab and resolved after treatment. No patient developed antigaliximab antibody formation. The mean serum half-life ranged from 13 to 24 days. The overall response rate was 11% (two complete responses and two partial responses). Time to best response was delayed (months 3, 6, 9, and 12). Twelve patients (34%) maintained stable disease. Nearly half of all patients (49%) had a decrease in indicator lesions. Two responders remain on study without progression (22 and 24.4 months). CONCLUSION: The favorable safety profile of galiximab and evidence of single-agent biologic activity and dose-dependent pharmacokinetics support further evaluation of galiximab as a treatment for follicular lymphoma, possibly in combination with other lymphoma therapies.
