Previous studies have reported that low-grade B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders have variable B-cell monoclonality detection rates by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. For instance, monoclonal B-cell populations from chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma are most often readily amplified with a single primer pair, whereas follicular lymphomas and plasma cell neoplasms require alternative strategies to approach these higher diagnostic sensitivity standards. Because most published reports have not focused on the variation in PCR B-cell monoclonality detection among subtypes of intermediate and high-grade B-cell neoplasms, additional information is necessary to determine primer selection strategies and identify problematic tumor subtypes within this group. The current investigation, the third part in a series, was aimed at documenting the efficiency of B-cell monoclonality detection by PCR in 71 aggressive B-cell neoplasms of various types using a comprehensive approach. A predetermined panel of primer sets was used in an algorithmic fashion. Specifically, all samples were analyzed with the standard VH-FRIII/JH assay previously shown to have the highest efficiency of monoclonality detection within low-grade B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. Negative samples were further evaluated with primer sets in the following order until a positive result was observed, or all primer sets were used: (1) bcl-2/JH, (2) VH-FRI family specific/JH, and (3) VH-FRI consensus/JH. Forty-three (61%) of the 71 B-cell neoplasms evaluated with VH-FRIII/JH showed monoclonal B-cell populations. Sequential use of the three reserve primer sets in samples negative with this initial primer pair resulted in an overall improvement in PCR detection from 61% to 82% (58 of 71 specimens) (P < .001). The VH-FRI family specific assay identified B-cell monoclonality in 11 (73%) of these 15 specimens and was the most productive reserve primer set. Individual categories exhibited the following initial (I) and final (F) PCR detection rates: acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma, 11 specimens (I = 91% to F = 91%); small noncleaved cell lymphoma, 14 specimens (I = 79% to F = 86% [P > .25]); diffuse large cell lymphoma, 33 specimens (I = 52% to F= 85% [P < .005]) and large cell, immunoblastic lymphoma, 13 specimens (I = 38% to F = 62% [P < .01]). The authors have shown that comprehensive PCR analysis is capable of detecting B-cell monoclonality in a significant proportion of samples from each subtype of intermediate and high-grade B-cell neoplasm. The VH-FRIII/JH assay was an adequate initial primer set, but required augmentation with the reserve PCR assays to attenuate the false negative rate and improve diagnostic sensitivity. The B-cell clonality PCR assay is optimally used as a screening tool and when used in this fashion, the more laborious and time-consuming restriction fragment-Southern blot hybridization (RF-SBH) method for IgH gene rearrangement detection may be limited to a relatively small proportion of PCR-negative aggressive B-cell neoplasms.
