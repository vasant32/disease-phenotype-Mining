Fifty-three patients with advanced lymphocytic lymphoma were randomly assigned to treatment with the combination cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP) or the same agents used successively in maximal doses (C-V-P). Complete remissions occurred in 68% with CVP and 48% with C-V-P. For patients with nodular lymphoma, the complete remission rate was 81% with CVP and 46% with C-V-P. In patients with diffuse lymphoma a complete remission rate of 50% was obtained with both regimens. The median duration of response was longer for patients who obtained complete remission with CVP (37+ months) than for those entering remission with C-V-P (25+ months). More patients treated with CVP still survive. Current results suggest that CVP is a better induction regime than C-V-P in patients with nodular lymphoma. However, in patients with diffuse lympoocytic lymphoma, neither regimen results in more than 50% complete remissions or significant numbers of prolonged responses. More effective therapy is needed.
