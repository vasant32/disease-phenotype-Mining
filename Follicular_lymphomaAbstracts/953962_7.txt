The results of bone scanning with the newer technetium-99m complexes were correlated with clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings in 26 patients with malignant lymphoma (10 with Hodgkin's disease and 16 with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas). Abnormalities on bone scan compatible with lymphomatous involvement of the skeleton appeared to occur more commonly in patients with diffuse lymphomas than in patients with nodular lymphomas and were generally observed in the setting of advanced disease (15 of 23 patients). Twenty-seven (73%) of the 37 scans obtained were abnormal. Although abnormal scans were observed with the greatest frequency in patients with bone pain (11 of 11), bone marrow involvement (11 of 12), abnormal skeletal radiographs (11 of 11), and elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels (5 of 6), bone scanning also detected lymphomatous involvement in patients free of pain or with normal laboratory tests. Moreover, conventional radiography was entirely normal in six (35%) of 17 patients with abnormal scans and revealed only nonspecific osteopenia in another two patients (12%). Serial bone scans in nine patients reflected their response to chemotherapy. Of the 37 scans, only one was judged falsely positive and one falsey negative. Bone scanning with 99mTc complexes is a safe, simple, and sensitive screening procedure for detecting both extensive and focal lymphomatous involvement of the skeletal system and is a useful means of following such involvement in response to treatment.
