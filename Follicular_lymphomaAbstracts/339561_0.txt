A literature review about the significance and incidence of lymphography in intrathoracic diseases (lymphogranulomatosis, reticulum cell sarcoma, lymphosarcoma, chronic lymphatic leukemia, giant follicular lymphoma, pulmonary sarcoidosis) is given. Intrathoracic manifestations of malignant lymphomas are absolute indications for lymphography. With the proof of retroperitoneal lymph node involvement alterations in staging of the disease and therapeutical consequences are emerging. In benign lymph node diseases, such as pulmonary sarcoidosis, lymphography will be also helpful for staging, but therapeutic consequences do not ensue, an absolute indication for lymphography is not validated. Lymphography is valuable for the diagnosis of diseases and injuries of the thoracic duct. The existing methods of lymphographic visualization of intrathoracic lymph nodes are not yet satisfying and need further research.
