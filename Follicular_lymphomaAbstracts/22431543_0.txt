Composite lymphomas (CLs) consisting of 2 indolent B-cell lymphomas are rare. We present 2 CL cases composed of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and follicular lymphoma (FL), each with unique clinicopathologic features. In the first case, the FL was negative for IGH-BCL2 and harbored a novel IGH-associated translocation; in the second case, the CL manifested in the skin. The individual components in both CLs were derived from different B-cell clones. This is the first complete characterization, including molecular analysis, of CLs composed of leukemic CLL and FL and the first report of a cutaneous CL derived from 2 low-grade B cell lymphomas. Our results provide additional supporting evidence that CLs of indolent B-cell lymphomas are biclonal and suggest that they are pathogenetically different from CLs composed of a low-grade B-cell lymphoma and an aggressive B-cell lymphoma or Hodgkin lymphoma, which are usually clonally related.
