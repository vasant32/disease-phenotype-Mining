The BCL2/IGH translocation is a hallmark of follicular lymphoma and germinal center B-cell type diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Although a strong determinant of these histological subtypes, this translocation is insufficient by itself for lymphomagenesis, so that other genetic alterations are required. To clarify how the BCL2 translocation contributes to the development of specific lymphoma subtypes, we used chimeric mouse models and a bone marrow transplantation system to examine the biological features of BCL2-overexpressing B cells. These cells showed a cell-autonomous differentiation preference for follicular B cells. Their cell cycle progression was enhanced in wild-type but not in Emu-BCL2 transgenic mice, indicating that the low proliferative activity of B cells in Emu-BCL2 transgenic mice is partly due to their specific microenvironment, which is caused by the abnormal B cells themselves. Moreover, in vitro experiments demonstrated that Emu-BCL2(+) B cells have reduced responsiveness to terminal differentiation stimulation. According to these results, we hypothesize that B cells that have undergone BCL2/IGH translocation might possibly be forced to localize in follicles, and accumulate genetic abnormalities by being subjected to recurrent stimulation. Our findings lead us to propose that B cells carrying the BCL2/IGH translocation comprise a distinctive cell population that leads to the development of germinal center B-cell type lymphoma.
