The human t(14;18) chromosomal translocation is assumed to result from illegitimate rearrangement between BCL-2 and D(H)/J(H) gene segments during V(D)J recombination in early B cells. De novo nucleotides are found inserted in most breakpoints and have been thus far interpreted as nontemplated N region additions. In this report, we have analyzed both direct (BCL-2/J(H)) and reciprocal (D(H)/BCL-2) breakpoints derived from 40 patients with follicular lymphoma with t(14;18). Surprisingly, we found that more than 30% of the breakpoint junctions contain a novel type of templated nucleotide insertions, consisting of short copies of the surrounding BCL-2, D(H), and J(H) sequences. The features of these templated nucleotides, including multiplicity of copies for 1 template and the occurrence of mismatches in the copies, suggest the presence of a short-patch DNA synthesis, templated and error-prone. In addition, our analysis clearly shows that t(14;18) occurs during a very restricted window of B-cell differentiation and involves 2 distinct mechanisms: V(D)J recombination, mediating the breaks on chromosome 14 during an attempted secondary D(H) to J(H) rearrangement, and an additional unidentified mechanism creating the initial breaks on chromosome 18. Altogether, these data suggest that the t(14;18) translocation is a more complex process than previously thought, involving the interaction and/or subversion of V(D)J recombination with multiple enzymatic machineries.
