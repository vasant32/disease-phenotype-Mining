We report a case of a 63-year-old female, who presented with symptoms and signs of an acute biliary tract obstruction with jaundice and pain. Ultrasound together with intraoperative examination suggested a Klatskin tumour. Following radical resection, a tumour located predominantly in the wall of gallbladder, but infiltrating extensively also the walls of cystic, common hepatic and choledochus duct, was found. On the basis of cell morphology and the results of immunohistochemical analysis, the tumour was classified as an extranodal follicular lymphoma, grade II of the gallbladder, involving also hilar extrahepatic bile ducts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an extranodal follicular lymphoma in this location. A postoperative follow-up of more than 3 years has been completely uneventful without any symptoms or signs of disease recurrence.
