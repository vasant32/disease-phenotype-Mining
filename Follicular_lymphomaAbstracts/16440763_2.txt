A 58-year-old man had a relapsed follicular lymphoma (Grade 2) and was treated with mitoxantrone, fludarabine and dexamethasone followed by rituximab, and achieved partial remission. The patient then underwent high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (auto-PBSCT). Three days after starting high-dose therapy, he developed a fever, and a chest X-ray revealed pneumonia in the right lower lung. Despite of the administration of antibiotics and the recovery of neutrophils to normal levels, the pneumonia got worse. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed on day 32, the Ziehl-Neelsen staining of the BAL fluid showed acid-fast bacilli, and the culture grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient was diagnosed as having pulmonary tuberculosis and placed on an antituberculosis regimen (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide). On day 43 he also developed hemorrhagic cystitis due to adenovirus type 11, and on day 49 positive CMV antigenemia was detected, which were treated supportively. On day 75 he developed pneumonia probably due to Pneumocystis jirovecii, which was treated with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. The pulmonary tuberculosis resolved completely 4 months after starting the treatment, and the hemorrhagic cystitis and pneumocystis pneumonia resolved 1 month after the diagnosis. He remains in complete remission 2 years after transplantation.
