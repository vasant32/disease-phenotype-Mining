Neurogenic claudication is most frequently observed   in patients with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis. We describe   a patient with lumbar epidural varices secondary to obstruction   of the inferior vena cava by pathological lymph nodes presenting   with this syndrome. Following a diagnosis of follicular lymphoma,   successful chemotherapy led to the resolution of the varices and   the symptoms of neurogenic claudication. The lumbar epidural venous plexus may have an important role   in the pathogenesis of spinal stenosis. Although rare, epidural   venous engorgement can induce neurogenic claudication without spinal   stenosis. Further investigations should be directed at identifying   an underlying cause.
