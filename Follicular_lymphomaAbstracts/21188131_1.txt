Several studies have indicated that radioimmunotherapy is an effective and clinically relevant complementary therapeutic approach for patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and may convert partial to complete response when given as consolidation after induction chemotherapy. Yttrium-90((90)Y)-ibritumomab tiuxetan ((90)Y-IT, Zevalin(Â®), Y2B8) has documented efficacy for both indolent and aggressive NHL. Patients considered eligible for (90)Y-IT treatment should satisfy several screening criteria. A recently completed randomized study for patients with follicular lymphoma has demonstrated that (90)Y-ibritumomab consolidation also produced a marked prolongation of the median time to progression from 13.5 to 37 months, while partial responders seem to derive relatively more benefit. Other published and ongoing studies explore a similar use for patients with aggressive lymphoma. Studies are comparing the use of (90)Y-IT consolidation with the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab maintenance, which is also gaining acceptance. In conclusion, the documented benefit of radioimmunotherapy should be viewed in the context of the goals of treatment and the changing standards of care for lymphoma.
