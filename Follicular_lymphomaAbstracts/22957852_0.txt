To determine whether reported socioeconomic disparities in survival might be related to treatment, we examined patient and tumor characteristics associated with receipt of rituximab and survival in the National Cancer Institute's Patterns of Care Studies (2003 and 2008) for patients with diffuse large B-cell (DLBCL) and follicular (FL) lymphoma. Patients with DLBCL (n = 1192) were less likely to receive rituximab if they were older, black or Asian, lacked private medical insurance, had impaired performance status, had no lactate dehydrogenase measurements or were diagnosed with stage I disease. Patients with FL (n = 476) were less likely to receive rituximab if they were unmarried or non-Hispanic white. Receipt of rituximab did not differ by neighborhood median income. Treatment with rituximab was associated with better survival for patients with DLBCL, but not patients with FL. Lower rituximab use in patients with DLBCL without private insurance suggests that previously identified socioeconomic disparities in survival may, in part, be explained by receipt of rituximab.
