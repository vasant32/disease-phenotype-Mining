The t(14;18) translocation is a highly consistent feature of follicular lymphoma although the underlying mechanism generating this fusion remains uncertain. The breakpoints on chromosome 18 are at one of two sites, designated mbr and mcr, in the bcl-2 gene. A polymerase chain reaction strategy has been developed for amplification and direct sequencing of the resultant 14q+ and 18q- reciprocal junctions. Sequence analysis of the amplified 14q+ junction established that 21 tumours contained a bcl-2 (mbr) sequence to an immunoglobulin JH region, the majority being J5 or J6. A nonrandom pattern of breakpoints within the mbr region was found. Clustering of the breakpoint occurred with over 60% of the translocations clustering within 10 bases. There was a second cluster within the mbr 50 bases 3' of the first cluster. One of these junctions had an unusual configuration with the bcl-2 and JH sequences separated by a recognisable DH region. This suggests that at least some of the junctional sequences, previously thought of as N insertions, may be fragments of unrecognised DH regions. In one of these tumours it was possible to sequence the reciprocal 18q- junction, showing it to consist of a DH/bcl-2 (mbr) fusion. Analysis of both reciprocal junctions for a translocation in the mcr region of bcl-2, showed that this 18q- junction also consisted of DH fused to a bcl-2 sequence. In contrast to previous analyses, which demonstrated either loss or duplication of bcl-2 sequences at the breakpoints, the bcl-2 sequence was conserved during the mbr and mcr translocations in this study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
