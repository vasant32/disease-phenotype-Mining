Procarbazine hydrochloride is an oral alkylating agent with activity against lymphoma. It is most commonly used in the treatment of Hodgkin's disease. The use of procarbazine-containing chemotherapeutic regimens in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma fell out of favor with the advent of CHOP. We report two patients with relapsed and/or refractory follicular lymphoma that achieved a complete and durable remission with a prolonged course of daily procarbazine.
