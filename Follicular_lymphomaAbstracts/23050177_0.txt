The use of staging imaging modalities with increased sensitivity has led to an increase in the incidence of detection of simultaneous malignancies. These cases require careful evaluation and discussion in a multidisciplinary setting to establish a treatment plan that optimizes the outcome with respect to each malignancy, particularly when treatment modalities overlap. We report a case of a patient diagnosed with axillary nodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in a community hospital where staging workup also revealed synchronous bilateral breast carcinomas. To our knowledge, this is only the second case report of a patient with three synchronous primary malignancies: bilateral breast carcinomas and axillary DLBCL. The only other similar case report had no role for radiation or chemotherapy in the management of the indolent follicular lymphoma.
