To assess the distribution of lymphomas in Taiwan according to the WHO (World Health Organization) classification, 175 recently diagnosed cases of malignant lymphomas were studied and the clinicopathologic data were analyzed. B-cell lymphomas accounted for 57.1% of cases, T-cell lymphomas 38.9%, and Hodgkin's lymphoma 4%. Extranodal lymphomas predominated (55.4%). The most common subtype of B-cell lymphoma was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (33.1%). All tumor types believed to be derived from germinal center (GC) B-cells including follicular lymphoma (4.6%), Burkitt lymphoma (1.7%), Hodgkin lymphoma (4.0%), and GC-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (as defined by combined expression of bc1-6 and CD10) were rather uncommon as compared to frequencies seen in series from Western countries. The common T-cell lymphomas included nasal and extranasal NK/T cell lymphoma (7.4%), mycosis fungoides (7.4%), and unspecified peripheral T-cell lymphoma (6.9%). Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma was very uncommon and accounts for only 0.6%. The proportional increase in T-cell lymphomas that were unrelated to type I human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1) may be linked to differential Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) oncogenesis. The survival data revealed that mantle cell lymphoma, NK/T-cell lymphoma, unspecified peripheral T-cell lymphoma, and subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma had an aggressive course. Our results confirm the utility of the WHO classification scheme for prognostic stratification and further highlight the distinctive distribution pattern of malignant lymphoma in Taiwan including the higher relative incidence of T cell lymphomas and the rarity of germinal center-derived B-cell tumors.
