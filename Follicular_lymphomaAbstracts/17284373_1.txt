An elderly Chinese man who had an 8-year history of follicular lymphoma presented with large B-cell lymphoma. The disease ran a rapidly fatal course with a terminal leukemic phase. Cytogenetic analysis of the transformed follicular lymphoma showed a complex karyotype of 48,Y,t(X;19)(q26;p13.3),t(2;3)(p12;q27),t(8;14)(q24.1;q32),+12,t(14;18)(q32;q21),+21. To my knowledge, this is the first reported case of simultaneous occurrence of t(2;3), t(8;14), and t(14;18) in transformed follicular lymphoma.
