Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common form of low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Transformation to diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an important cause of mortality. Using cDNA microarray analysis we identified 113 transformation-associated genes whose expression differed consistently between serial clonally related samples of FL and DLBCL occurring within the same individual. Quantitative RT-PCR validated the microarray results and assigned blinded independent group of 20 FLs, 20 DLBCLs, and five transformed lymphoma-derived cell lines with 100%, 70%, and 100% accuracy, respectively. Notably, growth factor cytokine receptors and p38beta-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were differentially expressed in the DLBCLs. Immunohistochemistry of another blinded set of samples demonstrated expression of phosphorylated p38MAPK in 6/6 DLBCLs and 1/5 FLs, but not in benign germinal centers. SB203580 an inhibitor of p38MAPK specifically induced caspase-3-mediated apoptosis in t(14;18)+/p38MAPK+-transformed FL-derived cell lines. Lymphoma growth was also inhibited in SB203580-treated NOD-SCID mice. Our results implicate p38MAPK dysregulation in FL transformation and suggest that molecular targeting of specific elements within this pathway should be explored for transformed FL therapy.
