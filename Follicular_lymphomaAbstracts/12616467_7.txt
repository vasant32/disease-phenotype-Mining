Angiogenic cytokines regulate B-cell lymphopoiesis and are related to prognosis in B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) inhibits mature B-cell proliferation and immunoglobulin production. Increased levels of serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are associated with poor prognosis in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). To understand the expression of angiogenic cytokines at different stages of B-cell differentiation in lymph nodes, we examined the immunohistochemical expression of TGF-beta, VEGF, bFGF, and their receptors in five patients with reactive benign lymphadenopathy and 12 patients with B-cell NHL (mantle cell lymphoma, 4; small cleaved cell follicular lymphoma, 5; lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, 3). In benign lymph nodes, TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, and TGFbetaRII were positive in prefollicular mantle cells, follicular center cells, and postfollicular plasma cells. Basic FGF, FGF-R1, and FGF-R4 were positive in large follicular center cells and postfollicular plasma cells. Vascular endothelial growth factor was positive in large follicular center cells and postfollicular plasma cells. In NHL, TGF-beta and its receptors were weakly positive in small cleaved cell follicular lymphoma; VEGF was strongly positive in lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and weakly positive in mantle cell lymphoma. Basic FGF and its receptors were negative in NHL; however, FGF-R4 was positive in some cases of small cleaved cell follicular lymphoma. Our findings suggest that TGF-beta, bFGF, and their receptors have opposite roles in B-cell differentiation and maturation in benign lymph nodes. Transforming growth factor-beta and its receptors have an important role in germinal center development; loss of their activity could be associated with abnormal clonal proliferation of NHL.
