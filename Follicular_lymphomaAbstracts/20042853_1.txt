The identification of monotypic light chains is an important adjunct to the diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma, yet to reliably perform it on formalin-fixed paraffin sections is often difficult. We have evaluated a new set of monoclonal antibodies to kappa and lambda light chains that are reactive in paraffin sections. In reactive lymphoid tissues, polytypic staining was noted in greater than 95% of cases, with strong staining of plasma cells, moderate staining of the follicular dendritic cell network, and weak staining of mantle zone cells. Strong staining of the appropriate light chain was seen in each of the 7 cases of multiple myeloma. In a series of 58 cases of B-cell lymphoma, correlation between the results of immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry was obtained in 36 cases (62%), including 32 cases (21 kappa and 11 lambda) in which a single light chain was expressed. Monotypic staining was also seen in 6 additional cases (10%) in which flow cytometry was negative. Thirty of 46 cases (65%) of follicular lymphoma showed monotypic light chain expression, in contrast to 64 of 67 cases (95%) of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, which showed polytypic light chain expression. These antibodies may provide an effective adjunct to the diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma in routine diagnostic work.
