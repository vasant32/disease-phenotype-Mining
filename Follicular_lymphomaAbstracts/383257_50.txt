The evolution of the disease process in 92 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been analyzed by comparing the initial histopathologic material with that obtained at autopsy. The distribution of lymphoma did not differ substantially among the subtypes, but the gross appearance of the lesions was different among certain subtypes, particularly between the "small cell" and "large cell" types. The diffuse lymphomas showed a remarkable constancy of subtype in the same patient, whereas the nodular lymphomas showed a high frequency of change to a diffuse pattern and/or a larger cell type. Diffuse histiocytic lymphomas with plasmacytoid features showed a striking propensity for involvement of the gastrointestinal tract. The occurrence and significance of bizarre pleomorphic giant cells, epithelioid histiocytes, a "starry-sky" pattern, erythrophagocytosis, hemosiderosis and extramedullary hematopoiesis are reported. All patients received anti-lymphomatous chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. A second malignancy was observed in 8 patients. Thirteen patients showed no residual lymphoma at autopsy. The cause of death was considered to be related to lymphoma in all 92 patients; 67 had infections identified.
