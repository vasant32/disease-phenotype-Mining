Primary follicular lymphomas arise in the lymph nodes or spleen or in extranodal sites. Ocular adnexal tumors are rare. We report the case of a 6-year-old boy with a 3-mm conjunctival mass. The lesion was resected with clean surgical margins. The child has been closely monitored and has remained cancer free for 3 years.
