318 cases of 682 malignant B-cell lymphomas reacted positive for cIg. 66 of them showed Dutcher bodies (DB). DB were found in about 22% of plasmacytomas, 17% of immunocytomas, and in 7.5% of follicular lymphomas and polymorphic centroblastomas, respectively. Regarding only the cIg-positive cases, DB occurred in about 27% of immunocytomas, 20% of follicular lymphomas and 18% of polymorphic centroblastomas. A single case of prolymphocytic leukaemia, centrocytoma, monomorphic centroblastoma, and immunoblastoma each showed also DB. Usually, DB-positive plasmacytomas showed kappa, alpha, and J-chains. The remaining lymphomas mostly expressed kappa, my, and J-chains. In conclusion Dutcher bodies can occur with any cIg-producing B-cell lymphoma. They are not limited to immunocytomas.
