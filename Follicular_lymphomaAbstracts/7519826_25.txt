Expression of Bcl-2 protein and Fas antigens was analyzed in 12 cases of follicular lymphoma and 32 cases of diffuse lymphoma, including 22 B-cell and 10 T-cell lymphomas. It was shown that 75% of follicular lymphomas had clear expression of both Bcl-2 protein and Fas antigen. Thus, follicular lymphomas may have a growth advantage due to their high expression of Bcl-2 protein, which tended to impede apoptosis mediated by Fas antigen. On the other hand, diffuse lymphomas showed various patterns; 28% were double positive, 16% were only Bcl-2 protein-positive, 28% were only Fas antigen-positive, and 28% were double negative or equivocal. Cytocidal assay of seven leukemia/lymphoma cell lines using anti-human Fas monoclonal antibody revealed that overexpression of Bcl-2 protein tended to impede apoptosis mediated by Fas antigen. However, this inhibitory effect of Bcl-2 protein was incomplete and its effect might be dependent upon cell type.
