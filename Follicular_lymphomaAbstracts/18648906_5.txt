The frequency of subtypes of lymphoid neoplasms was determined in a prospective series of 831 patients presenting at 29 Shanghai hospitals over a 4-year period. Diagnosis and classification was established in a single laboratory according to the 2001 WHO classification system. The frequency of non-Hodgkin lymphoma was 87.6% (n = 728) and Hodgkin lymphoma was 12.4% (n = 103). The most prevalent NHL subtypes diagnosed using WHO criteria were diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), precursor B lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). Although a low incidence has been reported in some Asian populations, CLL/SLL was commonly encountered, indicating that chronic lymphoid neoplasms are not rare in Shanghai. Consistent with previous reports, our findings indicate a decrease in the frequency of follicular lymphoma and an increase in T cell neoplasms compared to the West. Precursor T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, anaplastic large T cell lymphoma, aggressive NK cell leukemia, angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma and peripheral T cell lymphoma were prominent subtypes of T cell NHL.
