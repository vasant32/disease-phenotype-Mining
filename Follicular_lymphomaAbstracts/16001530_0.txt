Malignant lymphomas are differentiated clinically, morphologically and molecular-biologically, into aggressive (formerly high-grade malignant) and indolent (formerly low-grade malignant) lymphomas. In the meantime, virtually all patients can be diagnosed and treated on an ambulatory basis. The introduction of the monoclonal antibody rituximab (R) in combination with chemotherapeutic agents, has led to the development of highly potent forms of chemoimmunotherapy. In the case of aggressive lymphomas, R-CHOP has been shown to be significantly superior to CHOP alone, both in elderly and younger patients. In stage III and IV indolent (follicular) lymphomas, rituximab/chemotherapy combinations achieve response rates in excess of 90%, and prolonged progression-free survival rates which, for the first time hold out hope of a cure. Monoclonal antibodies that can be coupled to radioisotopes open up new possibilities for potent radioimmunotherapy which look promising for effecting a cure or long-lasting palliation in additional proportion of the patients.
