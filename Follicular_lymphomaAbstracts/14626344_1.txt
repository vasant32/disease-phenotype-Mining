In a previous study, we showed that the high level of protein tyrosine phosphorylation present in lymphomas containing an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) can be demonstrated in routinely processed paraffin tissue sections using immunolabelling techniques. In the present study we investigated whether oncogenic tyrosine kinase activation also occurs in other categories of lymphoma by staining 145 cases of lymphoma covering those tumours with a range of different subtypes including those with morphological similarity to ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Twelve cases of the borderline malignant disorder lymphomatoid papulosis were also studied. Twenty seven of the 28 cases of ALK-positive ALCL showed the extensive cytoplasmic labelling for phosphotyrosine in the neoplastic cells. The remaining case containing moesin-ALK exhibited membrane-associated phosphotyrosine expression. There was no nuclear phosphotyrosine labelling in any of the ALK-positive ALCL, even though ALK was present within the cell nuclei in 23 of the tumours. Variable degrees of phosphotyrosine labelling, usually membrane-restricted, were observed in 7/40 cases of ALK-negative ALCL, 9/29 cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 3/6 cases of mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, 2/7 cases of Hodgkin's lymphoma, 3/6 cases of peripheral T-cell lymphomas unspecified, 4/6 cases of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, 2/6 cases of follicular lymphomas and 2/12 cases of lymphomatoid papulosis studied. However none of these phosphotyrosine-positive cases showed the strong cytoplasmic labelling comparable to that seen in ALK-positive lymphoma. We conclude that activation of a tyrosine kinase is probably not a major oncogenic event in lymphomas other than ALK-positive ALCL.
