PURPOSE: To use the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique for molecular assessment of the results of myeloablative treatment of follicular lymphoma with autologous bone marrow transplantation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-six patients with follicular or transformed follicular lymphoma were treated with cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg x 2 and total-body irradiation 12 Gy, supported by autologous bone marrow transplantation. The bone marrow mononuclear cell fraction was treated in vitro with CD20 monoclonal antibody and baby rabbit complement. The PCR technique was used to identify 50 patients with amplifiable t(14; 18) translocations in biopsy material from lymph nodes or bone marrow infiltrated by lymphoma. RESULTS: Following treatment of the harvested bone marrow in vitro, 29 samples were tested by PCR to assess the efficacy of purging. In 25 cases, the same t(14; 18) sequences were amplified as from the patients' original biopsies, while in four cases, the marrow became PCR-negative. Three of the four patients treated with PCR-negative marrow subsequently developed recurrent lymphoma, compared with 11 of 25 in the PCR-positive group. Bone marrow and peripheral-blood mononuclear cell samples from 27 patients were studied during the follow-up period. All but one had the presence of the lymphoma-related t(14; 18) clone detectable by PCR and confirmed by direct sequencing from at least one sample between 3 months and 7 years after reinfusion of the bone marrow. With a median follow-up duration of 3 years, 13 patients developed recurrent disease, 13 remained in remission with the t(14; 18) still detectable, and one died of acute myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSION: This form of therapy does not eliminate the lymphoma-related t(14; 18)-bearing clone of cells, although the significance of its continued presence is uncertain. Improved methods for both treatment of the bone marrow in vitro and treatment of the lymphoma in vivo are required.
