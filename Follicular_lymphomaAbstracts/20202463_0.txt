Substantial progress has been made in the clinical management of patients with follicular lymphoma over the past 2 decades. However, the role of autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation in these patients remains controversial. Myeloablative chemotherapy or radioimmunotherapy supported by autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation has been shown to lead to a longer progression-free survival and, in some studies, improved survival over standard therapy. However, in the era of rituximab-based therapies used as part of induction or salvage, these historical trials may not be representative. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation offers the advantages of a tumor-free graft and some immunologic graft-versus-lymphoma effects. However, fully myeloablative transplants have high morbidity and mortality rates. Dose-reduced conditioning regimens followed by allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation have substantially reduced treatment-related mortality and perhaps will produce better outcomes long-term. This article outlines some historical information regarding stem cell transplantation for follicular lymphoma and discusses recent modifications that may improve outcomes, such as adding radioimmunotherapy to autologous stem cell transplantation or using alternative dose-reduced regimens that could benefit patients with reduced toxicities.
