Cell surface immunoglobulin, complement receptor, and spontaneous rosette formation with sheep erythrocytes were investigated in 43 patients with malignant lymphoma, including 13 with lymphosarcoma cell leukemia, and in 59 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The quantity of immunoglobulin on the lymphocyte surface was estimated from the intensity of fluorescent staining with fluorescein-conjugated anti-immunoglobulin antisera. At least two, and probably three, B cell species could be recognized by cell surface study. Cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia and diffuse well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma had sparse amounts of surface immunoglobulin, while the cells of diffuse poorly differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma had large quantities of this material. Nodular lymphoma probably represented a third B-cell subtype with intermediate amounts of surface immunoglobulin. The lymphocytes of chronic lymphosarcoma cell leukemia exhibited the intense surface staining, which was characteristic of the underlying poorly differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma (diffuse or nodular), and could be readily distinguished from the faint-staining chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.
