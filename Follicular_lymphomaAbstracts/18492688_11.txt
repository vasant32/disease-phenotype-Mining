 BACKGROUND: Follicular lymphomas are currently subdivided into grades I, II, IIIa and IIIb. This distinction is, however, questioned. DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied the gene expression profile of 43 follicular lymphomas, 50 B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of different histotype, and 20 samples of normal B-lymphocytes in order to assess: (i) the relationship of follicular lymphoma with normal B cells and other B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas; (ii) whether follicular lymphoma is a unique disease; and (iii) whether follicular lymphoma grade IIIb is closer to follicular lymphoma or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the germinal center B-cell type. RESULTS: First, we found that the molecular profile of follicular lymphoma is intimately related to that of normal germinal center B cells, irrespectively of the histological grade. Secondly, we observed that follicular lymphoma has a relatively homogeneous gene expression profile that is distinct from that of other B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and does not include discrete molecular subgroups. However, by further clustering samples according to signatures differentially expressed among follicular lymphomas or in follicular lymphomas versus diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, we showed that grade I-IIIa tumors tend to cluster together, while grade IIIb follicular lymphoma constitutes a distinct subgroup, whose molecular signature is closer to that of the remaining follicular lymphomas than to that of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the germinal center B-cell type. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the hypothesis that grade IIIb follicular lymphoma does indeed belong to the group of follicular lymphomas rather than diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, and also suggests a possible revision of the histological grading of follicular lymphomas, with their simple distinction into follicular lymphoma (grade I-IIIa) and follicular lymphoma/large cell (grade IIIb).
