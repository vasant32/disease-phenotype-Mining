We evaluated the usefulness of multiparameter flow cytometry with cluster analysis in the diagnosis of a series of 100 well-characterized small B-cell lymphomas (SBCLs). The histologic diagnoses in the 100 cases were follicular lymphoma (FL) in 58, marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) in 17, small lymphocytic lymphoma in 15, and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in 10. Of the 58 FLs, 57 were CD10 positive (98% sensitivity). The 1 negative case was unusual in that it occurred in the small intestine. However; architectural, cytologic, and immunohistochemicalfeatures were diagnostic of FL. Of 42 other SBCLs, 2 were CD10+ (95% specificity); 1 was a CD5+/cyclin D1 + MCL, and the other was an extranodal MZL. We found that assessment of CD10 expression using multiparameter flow cytometry with cluster analysis is highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of FL, validating its usefulness in situations in which adequate tissue is not available for definitive histologic diagnosis.
