Collision tumors are defined as the simultaneous presence of two adjacent but histologically distinct tumor types arising in the same organ or site. The occurrence of these tumors is rare. We report a 52 year-old woman with a collision tumor consisting of metastatic adenocarcinoma and follicular lymphoma present in the same lymph node, excised from the left supraclavicular space. The patient died four weeks after the diagnosis was made.
