In human beings the prevalence of different non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) subtypes varies according to geographical region. The aim of this study was to classify canine lymphomas in Austria and to compare the results with those of similar studies in other countries. Eighty-two NHLs were classified according to their morphology (based on the Working Formulation) and their immunophenotype (determined with anti-T-cell and anti-B-cell antibodies). Forty-two (51.2%) were of B-cell subtype, 24 (29.3%) of T-cell subtype, and 16 (19.5%) remained unclassified, because of either negative labelling (9/16) or immunoreaction with both antibodies (7/16). Diffuse lymphomas predominated (99%) over follicular lymphomas, while intermediate grade lymphomas (61%) outnumbered high-grade lymphomas (23.2%) and low grade lymphomas (13.4%). The most common subtype was the diffuse large cell lymphoma (40.2%), followed by the large cell immunoblastic lymphoma (13.4%) and the diffuse small lymphocytic lymphoma (13.4%). Follicular large cell lymphoma and small noncleaved cell lymphoma were uncommon (1.2%). Generally, these findings accord with those of similar studies in Western Europe, making the existence of specific risk factors in Austria unlikely.
