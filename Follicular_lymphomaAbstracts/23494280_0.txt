Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma (NLPHL) is a rare subtype of Hodgkin's lymphoma. The histological patterns of NLPHL variants are characterized by different localizations of the tumor cells, intranodular and perinodular and by the varying composition of the microenvironment. T-cell/histiocyte-rich B-cell lymphoma may be the result of an aggressive transformation of NLPHL. Classical lymphocyte-rich Hodgkin's lymphoma can usually be clearly distinguished from NLPHL by the immunophenotype of the tumor cells. Further differential diagnoses include follicular lymphoma and the follicular variant of peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma with CD20-positive blasts represents a differential diagnosis to the diffuse variants of NLPHL.
