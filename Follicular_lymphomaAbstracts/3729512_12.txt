Hypertrichosis lanuginosa acquisita was observed in a female patient with small-cell follicular lymphoma stage IVB. The patient had additional complaints of a burning sensation on the tip of the tongue and the sudden appearance of several seborrheic keratoses on hands and forearms. The findings are well in agreement with those reported in the literature. It is concluded that the sudden appearance of down in an area previously perceived as hairless by the patient is highly indicative of widely disseminated internal malignancy and that this phenomenon can be seen in a wide range of cancers. Possible considerations for future investigations are given.
