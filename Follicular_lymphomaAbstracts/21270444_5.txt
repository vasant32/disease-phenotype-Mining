Epidemiologic data show that the immune system may control or promote the emergence and growth of neoplastic lymphomatous clones. Conversely, systemic lymphomas, especially myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), are associated with clinical immunodeficiency. This prospective controlled study demonstrates substantially reduced circulating T helper cells, predominantly naive CD4(+) cells, in patients with nonleukemic follicular lymphoma and extranodal marginal zone lymphoma, but not in monoclonal gammopathy and early CLL. These changes were correlated with a preactivated phenotype, hyperreactivity in vitro, pre-senescence, and a T helper 2 shift of peripheral T helper cells. No prominent alterations existed in the regulatory T-cell compartment. Gene expression profiling of in vitro-stimulated CD4(+) cells revealed an independent second alteration of T helper cell physiology, which was most pronounced in early CLL but also detectable in follicular lymphoma/extranodal marginal zone lymphoma. This pattern consisted of down-regulation of T-cell receptor signaling cascades and globally reduced cytokine secretion. Both types of T-cell dysfunction may contribute to significant immunodeficiency in nonleukemic indolent B-cell lymphomas as demonstrated by unresponsiveness to hepatitis B vaccination. The precise definition of systemic T-cell dysfunction serves as the basis to study its prognostic impact, its relationship to the established influence of the lymphoma microenvironment, and its therapeutic manipulation.
