The binding of horseradish-peroxidase-labelled peanut lectin (HRP-PNL) to cryostat sections of tonsil, lymphoma lymph nodes, reactive lymph nodes and miscellaneous tumours demonstrated that PNL binds selectively to lymphocytes in germinal centres. Lymph nodes from 21 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were phenotyped as cell suspensions for PNL binding, and the following surface markers: E rosetting, C3d, SIg, OK markers of T-cell subsets, Ig heavy-chain and light-chain classes. There was a positive correlation between PNL binding and cells with SIg and C3d receptors. 4/5 cases of centroblastic/centrocytic follicular lymphoma had a PNL+ SIg+ C3d+ phenotype. Both cases of centroblastic/centrocytic diffuse lymphoma were PNL-. There was no correlation between PNL binding and heavy- or light-chain Ig class. PNL binding and presence of C3d receptors were not always positively correlated, indicating that follicular cells may be either PNL+ SIg+ C3d+ or PNL+ SIg+ C3d-. The binding pattern of PNL to 1 case of thymic hyperplasia and 2 cases of malignant lymphoma lymphoblastic T type suggested that some but not all cortical thymocytes bind PNL.
