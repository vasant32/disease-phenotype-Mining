Clinicopathologic analyses were done on 10 patients with follicular lymphoma including 8 patients with low grade malignancy. The complete response rate to chemo- and combined modality therapy was 80% with no deaths occurring in patients in complete remission with median follow-up of 73 months. The 5-years' survival for these 10 patients was 86%. There were two patients with second primary neoplasm, one with gastric cancer detected one year after initiation of chemotherapy, the other with leiomyosarcoma detected 3 years after cessation of chemotherapy. Histologic transformation from follicular medium sized cell to diffuse large cell was noted in one patient.
