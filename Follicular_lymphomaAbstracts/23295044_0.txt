Positron emission tomography (PET) has a proven role in the assessment diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). The clinical impact of PET carried out at the end of the patient's course of treatment is undeniable and recommendations must be followed in the interpretation of these examinations. PET is highly recommended as part of the initial investigations of these diseases because it can be used as a reference for the interpretation at treatment completion and allows disease spread to be assessed with greater sensitivity and specificity than when computed tomography (CT) is used. It seems to be certain that PET is useful for interim examinations too, in terms of assessing prognosis in DLBCL and HL, although its impact in terms of early changes to treatment is still to be determined. The criteria for interpreting the results of these early assessments are still evolving and the annual meetings in Menton, France, of groups of experts are leading towards a uniform interpretation method. In other types of lymphoma, PET can be useful for confirming local disease staging, especially in follicular lymphoma, and for guiding biopsy in patients with low-grade lymphoma that is suspicious for transformation into more aggressive disease. Several studies are in agreement that PET is valuable for assessing prognosis at treatment completion in FL and mantle cell lymphoma, but prospective studies are needed for this new indication to be validated.
