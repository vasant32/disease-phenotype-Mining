Out of 344 patients with newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), this study identified 16 patients presenting Burkitt-like cells (BLCs) after cytological and/or histological review. Conventional cytogenetic analysis showed at diagnosis complex chromosomal abnormalities in 13 cases and a normal karyotype in three cases. However, neither t(8;14)(q24;q32) nor the variants t(2;8)(p12;q24) or t(8;22)(q24;q11) was detected. FISH studies showed c-MYC amplification in all cases with four to more than seven copies in 10 - 77% metaphase or inter-phase cells. This study did not observe any gene fusion signal for c-MYC/IgH excluding a t(8;14) translocation and partial tri or polysomy of chromosome 8. It also excluded in that cases a break apart for the c-MYC locus. This study also never detected IgL/c-MYC, IgK/c-MYC or X-c-MYC. The BLCs were present whatever the lymphoma sub-type: follicular lymphoma (FL) was diagnosed in six out of 16 patients, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in four out of 16 patients, marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) in two out of 16 patients and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) in three out of 16 patients. One additional patient presented a T-cell lymphoma. The clinical course was aggressive with a poor prognosis, as death occurred in nine patients, within 6 months after diagnosis for eight of them. These data could suggest a sub-group of NHL patients (15 B-NHL, 1 T-NHL) have been identified with a poor prognosis characterized by the association of Burkitt-like cells and c-MYC amplification without t(8;14)(q24;q32) or its variants. The possibility that this profile may represent a distinct morphologic NHL sub-set remains to be determined on a large cohort of patients.
