This study describes a method for obtaining the distribution of a given cell type in histological sections, as revealed by a specific immunological marker. Two hundred fifty-six contiguous microscopic fields were analysed, and a cellular map was automatically constructed. The resulting images were stored on magnetic media for subsequent quantification and statistical tests. The method was applied to the analysis of 20 small cleaved-cell lymphomas in which the monoclonal antibody Ki-67 was used to mark proliferating cells. Clusters of proliferative cells were observed in both diffuse and nodular lymphomas. Cellularity and the percentage of marked cells were not significantly different in the two types of tumors.
