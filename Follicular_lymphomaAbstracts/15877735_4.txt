We have studied the expression of RHOF, a member of the Rho-GTPase family, in an array of lymphoid cells and tissues. Previous microarray studies demonstrated RHOF upregulation in a subset of transformed follicular lymphomas. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction evaluated RHOF expression in lymphocyte subpopulations, and normal and malignant lymphoid tissue. Cells and tissues of B-cell origin expressed higher RHOF levels than their T-cell counterparts. Neoplastic cells and tissues of B-cell origin expressed higher levels of RHOF than their benign cellular counterparts. Relatively elevated levels of RHOF were seen in lymphomas derived from germinal centre origin.
