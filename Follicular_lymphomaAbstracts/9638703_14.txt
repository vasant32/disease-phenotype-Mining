The proto-oncogene bcl-2 is associated with follicular lymphoma involving translocation t(14;18)(q32;q21) and is also overexpressed in various neoplasms. We report deregulation of bcl-2 expression during progression from oral epithelial dysplasia to squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical analysis with monoclonal antibodies to bcl-2 oncoprotein in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections revealed that severe epithelial dysplasias had a higher percentage of immunoreactivity than did mild and moderate dysplasias and squamous cell carcinomas. Expression of this oncoprotein was directly proportional to the degree of epithelial dysplasia, and nondysplastic basal cells contiguous to neoplastic lesions also expressed bcl-2. These findings, along with down-regulation of bcl-2 in differentiating carcinomas, suggest a role for this oncoprotein in relatively early stages of oral tumor progression. Differentiating neoplastic cells with marginal or no bcl-2 reactivity showed heterogeneous cell labeling of varying intensity for differentiation-associated cytokeratin (CK13), indicating their inverse topographic relationship.
