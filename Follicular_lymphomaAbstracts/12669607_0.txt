A study was performed in 80 patients with follicular lymphomas and 61 patients with follicular hyperplasia of lymph nodes. The sensitivity, specificity, prognostic value, and the positive and negative likelihood ratio of various histological differentially diagnostic parameters were estimated. The signs that are of great informative value were as follows: the presence (or absence) of concentric layers of mantle cells, follicular polarization, the presence of histiocytes with phagocytosed nuclear debris in the follicles and atypical follicular cells outside the follicles.
