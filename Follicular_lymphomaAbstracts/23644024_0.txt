 AIMS: The Natural Killer Cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptor (KIR) genotype profiling in Follicular Lymphoma has not been reported before in the literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA extracted from 20 Follicular Lymphoma patients and 62 healthy controls was analyzed for KIR genotyping using a polymerase chain reaction/sequence specific primers technique (PCR/SSP) for the presence of 16 KIR gene and pseudogene loci. RESULTS: The AA, AB, and BB genotype frequencies were, respectively, 20%, 60% and 20% with an A:B ratio of 1:1. KIR 2DL4, KIR 3DL2, KIR 3DL3, and KIR 3DP1*003 were presented in all individuals. No significant difference between patients and controls was detected. CONCLUSION: KIR genotyping profile does not seem to be associated with Follicular Lymphoma. The results presented in this pilot research represent the first international report about this important clinical entity.
