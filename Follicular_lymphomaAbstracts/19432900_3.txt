We conducted a phase I/II study to investigate the toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy profiles of cladribine with 2-h intravenous infusion for five consecutive days every four weeks in Japanese patients with relapsed indolent B-cell lymphoma. This was a dose-escalation study to confirm the safety of the doses which have been recommended for Caucasian patients (phase I), and to further evaluate the efficacy and safety (phase II). In the phase I portion for nine patients, no dose-limiting toxicities were observed at levels 1 (0.09 mg/kg/day, n = 3) and 2 (0.12 mg/kg/day, n = 6). No appreciable accumulation of plasma cladribine concentration was suggested. We enrolled a total of 20 patients, and an additional 14 patients in the phase II portion at level 2 (0.12 mg/kg/day). Eighteen patients, including 13 with follicular lymphoma, were eligible for efficacy evaluation, and 15 (83%) were pretreated with rituximab. The overall response rate was 50% (9/18; 80% confidence interval, 35-65%), with 11% (2/18) complete response. With a median follow-up of 296 days, the estimated median time to progression for 18 eligible patients was 382 days. The most frequent adverse events were hematologic toxicities, including grade 4 neutropenia. Non-hematologic toxicities were mild. In conclusion, cladribine with 2-h intravenous infusion for five consecutive days every four weeks is effective with acceptable toxicities for Japanese patients with relapsed indolent B-cell lymphoma, including those pretreated with rituximab.
