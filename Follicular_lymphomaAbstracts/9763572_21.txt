Immunoglobulin class switching usually involves deletion of part of the immunoglobulin CH region. By DNA fiber fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a barcode of probes covering the DH, JH, and CH genes, the configuration of the entire CH region can be visualized on single DNA molecules. Using this technique, we have studied class switching in three types of B-cell neoplasia, mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL), follicular lymphoma (FL) and hairy cell leukemia (HCL), representing B cells in, respectively, pregerminal center, germinal center, and postgerminal center stages of development. In MCL and FL, simultaneous detection of the t(11;14) and t(14;18) breakpoint with probes for the BCL-1 and BCL-2 loci, respectively, allowed differentiation between productive and nonproductive alleles. In none of 10 MCL cases was class switching detected. In 21 HCL, all nonimmunoglobulin M (IgM) cases had class-switch deletion consistent with the expressed isotype on at least one allele. In FL, however, a peculiar pattern of CH rearrangement was observed. In IgM expressing FL, the translocated alleles had switched in 11 of 13 cases, and the nontranslocated allele showed complex rearrangements downstream from the Cmu-Cdelta genes in 9 of 13 cases. These downstream rearrangements may reflect tumor-specific deregulation of the class-switch machinery. All seven immunoglobulin G (IgG) expressing FL showed class switching on both alleles. Fiber FISH analysis also showed several polymorphisms. The most frequent one, present on 38% of all analyzed alleles, consisted of an extra Cgamma gene or pseudogene in the 3' cluster.
