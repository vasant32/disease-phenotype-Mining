The BCL2 (B cell lymphoma/leukemia -2) and C-MYC oncogenes become activated by chromosomal translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus in human follicular lymphomas and Burkitt lymphomas, respectively. Though much is known about the biological actions of C-MYC, little information is available concerning the functions of BCL2, particularly in human B cells. Using a gene transfer approach we contrasted the effects of deregulated BCL2 and C-MYC expression in a human EBV-immortalized B cell line GM607B. Both BCL2 and C-MYC enhanced the ability of GM607B cells to grow in reduced serum and in limiting dilution cultures. These findings provide direct evidence that BCL2 can alter the growth characteristics of human B lymphocytes, thus strengthening arguments for its role in the pathogenesis of human lymphomas.
