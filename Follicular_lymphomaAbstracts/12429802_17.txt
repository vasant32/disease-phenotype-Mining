Clusterin expression has been reported to be characteristic of systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma and usually negative in cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma as well as other lymphoma types. We surveyed clusterin expression using immunohistochemical methods in 266 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease to further assess the diagnostic utility of this marker. Clusterin immunostaining was observed in 40 of 49 (82%) systemic anaplastic large cell lymphomas and 12 of 29 (41%) cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphomas. Clusterin also was expressed in 5 of 43 (12%) diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (4 of 5 CD30+), 1 of 14 (7%) peripheral T-cell lymphomas, 1 of 32 (3%) cases of nodular sclerosis Hodgkin's disease, and 1 case of mycosis fungoides in large cell transformation. Clusterin was negative in all other neoplasms assessed including follicular lymphoma of all grades (n = 24), mantle cell lymphoma (n = 13), marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (n = 12), precursor T-cell or B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (n = 10), mixed cellularity Hodgkin's disease (n = 8), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (n = 7), Burkitt lymphoma (n = 7), mycosis fungoides (n = 4), nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's disease (n = 3), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (n = 2), and plasmacytoma (n = 2). We conclude that clusterin is a marker of anaplastic large cell lymphoma and that addition of clusterin to antibody panels designed to distinguish systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma from classical Hodgkin's disease is useful. However, clusterin is also positive in a substantial subset of cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphomas, a smaller subset of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, and rarely in cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma and nodular sclerosis Hodgkin's disease.
