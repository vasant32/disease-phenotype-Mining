Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is the fifth most common malignancy, with an annual incidence in the UK of 8/100,000. Until recently this incidence had been rising over the past two decades. The WHO classification divides non-Hodgkin's lymphomas into B- or T-cell neoplasms, with 85% of general lymphomas and almost all orbital lymphomas consisting of B-cell tumours. A case of systemic follicular lymphoma, with later orbital involvement, is presented.
