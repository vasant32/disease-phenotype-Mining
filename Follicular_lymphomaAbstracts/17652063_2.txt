Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is the most common extranodal lymphoma, accounting for approximately 40% of all extranodal NHLs. Initial treatment of duodenal lymphoma includes surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, alone or in combination. Here, we present a case of stage I primary duodenal follicular lymphoma (FL) showing a complete response after rituximab therapy. Rituximab alone can be an effective alternative treatment for duodenal FL.
