PURPOSE First-line treatment for patients with newly diagnosed follicular lymphoma (FL) still remains debated, even in the rituximab-based combination therapy era. Few studies have addressed the question whether complete remission (CR) translates into better survival. The aim of this study was to assess the long-term follow-up of prospectively treated patients with FL and the potential correlation between response quality to first-line treatment and overall survival (OS). PATIENTS AND METHODS Data from 536 patients with FL with low (n = 193) or high (n = 343) tumor burden enrolled from October 1986 to May 1995 in the French and Belgian GELF86 studies were analyzed. Data from these trials have been previously reported for low-tumor burden and high-tumor burden patients. Results Median follow-up was 14.9 years, and median OS was 9.8 years. Treated patients who achieved a complete response (CR; n = 194; 45%) had a significant longer OS than those only reaching a partial response (PR; n = 168; 39%) throughout treatment (hazard ratio [HR], 0.55; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.72; P < .001) in an univariate time-dependent Cox model. Similar findings were found when response to treatment (CR v PR) was adjusted for potentially confounding factors in a multivariate model (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.73; P < .001). CONCLUSION These data provide a long follow-up of these patients' cohorts and indicate that a better response to first-line treatment translates into an improved survival for patients with FL. Therefore, response-adapted therapy aiming to achieve a CR should be considered as first-line treatment.
