The caspase proteins are essential for the regulation of normal B cell development and regulation of apoptosis. We investigated five single nucleotide polymorphisms in four key caspase genes, CASP3 [Ex8-280C>A (rs6948) and Ex8+567T>C (rs1049216)], CASP8 Ex14-271A>T (rs13113), CASP9 Ex5+32G>A (rs1052576) and CASP10 Ex3-171A>G (rs3900115) to determine whether they alter risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in a population-based case-control study of women in Connecticut (461 cases and 535 controls). Variants in CASP3 and CASP9 were significantly associated with a decreased risk for NHL, particularly follicular lymphoma [e.g. CASP3 Ex8+567T>C odds ratio (OR)(CC+TC) = 0.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.3-0.7; and CASP9 Ex5+32G>A OR(AA+AG) = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.4-1.0]. Further, variants in CASP3, CASP8 and CASP10 were associated with a decreased risk of marginal zone lymphoma and variants in CASP3 and CASP10 were associated with a lower risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and related subtypes. The striking protective associations observed for polymorphisms in all four genes for NHL and/or one or more subtypes suggest that genetic variation in CASP genes may play an important role in the etiology of NHL.
