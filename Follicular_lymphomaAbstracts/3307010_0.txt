The paper is concerned with a case of Brill-Symmers' disease started with the thrombocytopenic syndrome relating to hypersplenism. After splenectomy the first benign stage of disease without eradication therapy lasted over 10 years. Signs of immunological incompetence (signs of secondary infection) and recurring immune thrombocytopenia were noted in that period. A regular use of glucocorticoids and antibiotics resulted in the improved condition. The development of the second stage of disease (malignant diffuse lymphoma with the involvement of the internal organs) was fast resulting in the patient's death.
