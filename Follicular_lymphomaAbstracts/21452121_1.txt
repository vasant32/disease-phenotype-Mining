Reactivation, recurrence or acute infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) represent severe complications of biological therapy. Reported is a case of a 58-year-old female treated in the past with cytostatics and rituximab for follicular lymphoma, in whom HBV infection was detected during a follow-up of the contacts of her partner diagnosed with acute viral hepatitis B. At the beginning, the patient had a very high serum level of HBV DNA (4.3 Ã— 108 IU/mL) and therefore she was treated with combined antiviral therapy (lamivudine and tenofovir). After 10 months, the serum level of HBV DNA decreased significantly (3,100 IU/mL) and the combined antiviral therapy was switched to monotherapy with tenofovir. Another 5 months later, the serum level of HBV DNA was only 950 IU/mL. This case demonstrates important clinical problems connected with HBV infection in immunocompromised persons.
