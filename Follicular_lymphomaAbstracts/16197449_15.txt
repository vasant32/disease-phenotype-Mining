Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a well-recognised complication. There is no consensus regarding indications for prophylaxis or a standard CNS chemoprophylaxis regimen. Current UK practice was evaluated using a questionnaire. A total of 223 questionnaires were sent to clinicians who administered chemotherapy to patients with NHL; 158 (71%) evaluable questionnaires were returned. The overwhelming majority of respondents used prophylaxis in all cases of lymphoblastic lymphoma (97%) and Burkitt lymphoma (96%). Ninety-six per cent of respondents required risk factors to be present before prophylaxis was initiated in cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The commonest risk factor was site of involvement (paranasal sinus 88%, testicular 85%, orbital cavity 78%, bone marrow 65% and bone 28%). Other risk factors included stage IV, high International Prognostic Index score, >1 extranodal site and raised lactate dehydrogenase levels (34%, 21%, 16% and 10%). A total of 82% did not give prophylaxis in follicular lymphoma and 90% used intrathecal chemotherapy as their preferred method of prophylaxis. The most popular regimen was 12.5 mg methotrexate with each cycle of chemotherapy for six courses. Thirty-nine per cent used systemic chemotherapy for CNS prophylaxis either alone (4%) or as an adjunct to intrathecal prophylaxis (35%). These variations in the indications and methods of prophylaxis indicate that this subject deserves further review.
