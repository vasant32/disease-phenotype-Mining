Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients have an increased incidence of lymphomas, particularly when there is a significant immunosuppression. Most commonly, they are non-Hodgkin B cell type with a high or intermediate grade and have an extranodal presentation. We report the case of a 38-year-old man with HIV infection who presented with a 1-year history of a painless tumor on the back and lymphadenopathies. The diagnosis of B cell lymphoma follicle center cell type was established by skin biopsy. Staging included a bone marrow biopsy revealing infiltration by the lymphoma and a whole-body computed tomographic scan showing multiple cervical and axillary lymphadenopathies with necrotic center. Biopsy of an axillary lymph node revealed caseating epithelioid granulomas and Ziehl-Neelson staining was positive for acid-fast bacilli. The patient started therapy for tuberculosis and polychemotherapy for lymphoma with complete response. This report illustrates a case of simultaneous occurrence of tuberculosis and systemic follicular lymphoma presenting in skin in an HIV patient.
