A 31-year-old Japanese male who complained of low-grade fever, fatigue and generalized lymphadenopathy had shown an increase in peripheral white cell count, and 84% of peripheral blood cell and 76% of nuclear bone marrow cells consisted of small cleaved lymphoblastic abnormal cells with or without barely visible nucleoli. Cytogenic study of cervical lymph node biopsy specimens showed a t(14;18)(q32;q21) chromosome translocation. Histologically the lymph node cells were classified according to the International Working Formulation as follicular small cleaved-cell lymphoma. Molecular analysis of DNA fragments of peripheral lymphocytes revealed both J-H gene and bcl-2 oncogene rearrangements. Immunophenotypes of peripheral lymphocytes, bone marrow cells and lymph node cells expressed a clonally distinct B-cell population bearing surface immunoglobulin-G, kappa-chain, CD-10, CD-19, CD-20, CD-21 and OKIa-1 antigens. We diagnosed this case as follicular lymphoma in the leukemic phase,
