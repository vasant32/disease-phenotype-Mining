The adult intussusception is rare. Here, we describe a case of an adult patient with ileocolic intussusception secondary to a recurrent lymphoma of the terminal ileum. The patient was a 42-year-old female, who had a history of the subtotal gastrectomy because of the primary gastric lymphoma. Eight months after the operation, she had a relapse in the abdomen and received the combination chemotherapy. She acquired the complete remission, but six months after the completion of the chemotherapy, she suffered from the right lower abdominal pain and diarrhea. Physical examination revealed a soft mass with tenderness in the right iliac fossa. Barium studies and abdominal computed tomography showed an ileocolic intussusception. At laparotomy, a 4.5 cm polypoid tumor was found in the terminal ileum and it passed through the ileocaecal valve to form an intussusception. Histologic examination disclosed the follicular lymphoma of medium-sized cell type. So far as we are aware, this is the first report of an adult patient with intussusception secondary to a lymphoma in Japan.
