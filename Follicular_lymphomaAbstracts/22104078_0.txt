Follicular lymphoma (FL) cases with a t(14;18)(q32;q21) and minimal or no additional karyotypic alterations, such as copy number gains and losses and/or chromosomal rearrangements, may exhibit pathologic features and a clinical behavior similar to those with more complex karyotypes. This study sought to investigate whether the copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (cnLOH) profiles of these minimally evolved t(14;18)(q32;q21)-positive follicular lymphoma (MEV-FL) cases are similar to or different from the majority of FL cases with more karyotypic alterations. Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array analysis was applied to the tumor genomes of 23 MEV-FL biopsy samples to assess for the presence of cnLOH. These cases carried either a single or no chromosomal abnormality in addition to t(14;18)(q32;q21) as determined by karyotyping. We found that, although these MEV-FL cases had simple karyotypes, they showed very similar cnLOH profiles as compared to cytogenetically complex cases. The most frequent regions affected by cnLOH were 1p (17%), 6p (17%), 12q (13%) and 16p (13%). Our study suggests that cnLOH alterations may serve as important contributors to the pathological and clinical manifestations of FL.
