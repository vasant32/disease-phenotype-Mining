This study reports two cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia of precursor B-cell type. The cases were associated with a t(14;18), but no evidence of a Burkitt's-type translocation was found. There was also no evidence of a preexisting follicular lymphoma. This cytogenetic variety of acute lymphoblastic leukemia has not been reported previously.
