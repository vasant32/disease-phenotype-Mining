Sixty-four cases of follicular lymphoma followed-up for 10 years have been studied. The influence of age, sex, histological appearance, immunophenotype and T-cell content on prognosis has been examined. Initial evaluation indicated that increasing age, relatively low numbers of intrafollicular T-cells and absence of mantle zones around the neoplastic follicles were associated significantly with mortality. Multiple regression analysis with adjustment for age and sex was performed and the only significant variable was then found to be the histological grade.
