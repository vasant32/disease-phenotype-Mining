From a survey of the literature on follicular lymphoma it appears that the lesion of Brill-Symmers disease may be considered to be a form of neoplasm. The authors have reviewed a series of 18 cases seen at the Hôtel-Dieu of Québec between 1950 and 1960 and have adopted Rappaport's classification published in 1956, but leaving out the "Hodgkin" Type 5 which they propose to examine more fully in another paper.There appears to be a degree of positive correlation between the histologic type and the course of the disease, the well differentiated cell Type 1 being associated with a protracted course. This neoplasm should not be mistaken for benign follicular hyperplasia.
