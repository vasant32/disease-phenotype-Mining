From a clone containing the entire locus of human endogenous retroviral element ERV1, we have obtained a DNA probe that is specific for the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR) sequence. This probe was used to map the LTR of ERV1 by in situ hybridization to chromosomes from normal human blood lymphocytes. The LTR was found to be localized to the distal portion of the long arm of human chromosome 18, within bands q22----q23. This chromosome locus is near the constitutive fragile site at band q21.3 on chromosome 18 associated with the 14;18 translocations seen in follicular lymphomas.
