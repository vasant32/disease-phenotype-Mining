 INTRODUCTION: In the Western world the second most common type of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas is follicular lymphoma (FL) comprising 30-35% of all cases. According to the data of the National Cancer Registry and our institute, this ratio is lower in Hungary and is about 15-20%, but the occurrence shows an increasing tendency. AIMS: Our aim was to survey and revise FLs that had been diagnosed at the National Institute of Oncology between 1990-1995. We studied the diagnostic relevance of histology, immunohistochemistry and the detection of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) and bcl-2 gene rearrangements. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We surveyed 53 cases that were previously diagnosed as follicular or centrocytic, centroblastic lymphoma. Following histological re-examination, immunohistochemistry (CD20, CD3, bcl-2, CD10, bcl-6, CD5, p53, cyclin D1 and Ki-67) was performed on each case. We also studied the IgH and bcl-2 (major breakpoint region=MBR) gene rearrangement on paraffin embedded samples with conventional PCR methods. The classification was made according to the new WHO classification. RESULTS: After the revision of the 53 cases we found 37 follicular, 11 diffuse large B-cell, 1 mantle cell and 1 marginal zone lymphomas, 1 nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma and 2 follicular hyperplasias. The grade of the FLs correlated with the expression of different antigens. CD10, bcl-2 expression and the proliferation index with Ki-67 showed good correlation with the grade of FLs. We could detect bcl-2 gene rearrangement in 55% of the FLs. CONCLUSION: Considering the diagnostic relevance of the different methods we can conclude that histology alone is not sufficient to make a correct diagnosis. Ninety percent of our cases were solvable with the help of immunohistochemistry and in 10% of the cases the diagnosis was partly based on the molecular pathological results.
