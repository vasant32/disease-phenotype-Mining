A new monoclonal antibody (MAb), CNA.42, was generated using the CEM T-cell line. It recognizes a 120-kd formalin-resistant glycosylated antigen that is mainly expressed by follicular dendritic reticulum cells (FDRCs). This antigen is also expressed by a few mononuclear cells in the paracortical area of reactive lymph nodes and by some cortical thymocytes. Two hundred and eighty-nine cases of hematopoietic tumors of various types were tested with this antibody. They showed either intact FDRC networks or FDRC networks dispersed among malignant cells. In follicular lymphomas, the follicular pattern was highlighted by CNA.42 MAb. Expanded FDRC networks were found in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphomas. Neoplastic cells were positive in 43.6% (24/55) of T-cell and 4.6% (6/129) of B-cell lymphomas. The highest percentage of cases with positive neoplastic cells was found in anaplastic large-cell lymphomas (62.5%; 15/24). In Hodgkin's disease, FDRC networks, sometimes encasing Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells, were found. HRS cells were also stained by this antibody in 23 (21.9%) of the 105 cases examined. A variety of normal nonlymphoid tissues and nonhematopoietic tumors, such as some neurogenic tumors, carcinoma, and occasional sarcomas, were found to be positive. Analysis of the reactivity of CNA.42 antibody with FDRCs of lymphoid tissue from different animal species showed similar reactivity to that observed in humans, suggesting widespread evolutionary conservation of the antigen recognized by this antibody. In daily diagnostic practice, CNA.42 MAb seems to be a suitable FDRC marker and possibly has an auxiliary role in recognizing T-cell lymphomas.
