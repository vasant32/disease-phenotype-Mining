The prognostic significance of specific cytogenetic abnormalities in follicular lymphoma (FL) is an area of ongoing research. A small percentage of FL are characterized by a polyploid karyotype. Several studies have analyzed ploidy level to determine its role as an independent prognostic factor in non-Hodgkins lymphoma, with equivocal results, mostly using DNA flow cytometry to ascertain ploidy status. We have performed cytogenetic analyses on 180 cases of FL with a t(14;18) diagnosed between 1980 and 1995. Cases were divided into a polyploid group (20 cases) and a non-polyploid group (160 cases), polyploidy defined as a modal chromosome number of 58 or greater. Each group included examples of the 3 subtypes of FL, [Working Formulation]: 1) follicular small cleaved cell (FSC), 2) follicular mixed, small and large cell (FM), and 3) follicular large cell (FLC). The median follow-up time was 38.5 months. The histological subclassification of the polyploid group revealed much less FSC (30% vs 66%, p < 0.004) and much more FLC (25% vs 4%, p < 0.003) than the non-polyploid group, implying histological progression may occur in parallel with the development of polyploidy. Recognized clinical prognostic factors were evenly distributed between the two groups and no survival difference was detected. We show that polyploidy as determined by classical cytogenetics is present in different frequencies across the subtypes of FL with a t(14;18), but is not an independent prognostic factor for survival in FL.
