Conjunctival dermoid cysts are a rare subtype of dermoid cyst usually presenting in adulthood. The authors report a case of a recurrent conjunctival dermoid cyst with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia that was immunohistochemically demonstrated to be polyclonal. Follicular centers that were present within the cyst wall were negative for Bcl-2 and positive for the immunohistochemical markers CD20, Bcl-6, CD10, and Ki67, which helped to differentiate the lesion from a follicular lymphoma. The lesion did not recur after 14 months of follow-up.
