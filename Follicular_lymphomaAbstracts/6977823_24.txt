Fifty human B-cell lymphomas have been studied with regard to surface markers (surface immunoglobulins (sIg) and complement receptors (CR)), capping of sIg, and relative amounts of sIg by single-cell flow cytometry. The results show that these lymphomas can be subdivided into distinct immunological subsets. Whereas one histological subgroup (lymphocytic) consisted of only one immunological subtype, others were heterogeneous with regard to immunological subtypes. This was most striking in nodular lymphomas of germinal centre cell origin (centroblastic/centrocytic). Our studies provide further evidence for the existence of a large number of subsets in the B-cell compartment of the immune system, sIgD was only found in association with sIgM. The relative amounts of sIgD varied, especially in nodular lymphomas. A discrepancy between capping of sIgM and sIgD was also found in some lymphomas belonging to this group. These findings together with other observations suggest that sIgD plays a role in B-cell maturation and differentiation events taking place in germinal centres and becomes lost during this process. A close association was found between the presence of CR and capping of sIgM but not capping of sIgD or sIgG. Nodular lymphomas expressing sIgG only, lacked CR. These findings suggest that CR may become lost during maturation and differentiation processes also taking place in germinal centres. Lymphoplasmacytoid lymphomas, which show morphological evidence of differentiation towards plasma cells, could be subdivided into three immunological subsets, indicating that plasma cell maturation may take place from different subsets of B cells.
