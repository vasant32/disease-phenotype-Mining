This study was aimed to explore the relationship between the single nucleotide polymorphisms of XPD (G23591A, A35931C) and individual susceptibility to non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) in Shandong populations. XPD gene polymorphism in 309 cases of NHL and 305 healthy controls were detected using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay in a case-control molecular epidemiology study. The association between gene polymorphism and the risk of NHL were examined through comparing odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) between two groups. The results showed that no significant association between the XPD (G23591A, A35931C) polymorphism and the risk of whole NHL was shown at first. In the further analysis, all NHL cases were divided into four groups: follicular lymphoma (FL) group, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) group, T-cell lymphoma group and other B-cell lymphoma group. Frequencies of XPD 23591GA + AA genotypes were 16.3%, 18.0%, 10.5% and 18.4% in each subgroup respectively, while 12.5% in control. Individuals carrying GA + AA genotype had 1.43, 1.58, 0.89 and 1.50-fold risk of NHL sub groups as much as GG genotype, but no statistically significant difference between subgroups and control was found (p>0.05); frequencies of XPD 35931AC + CC genotypes were 15.2%, 15.8%, 18.4% and 12.5% in each subgroup, while 11.5% in control. Individuals carrying AC + CC genotype had 1.41, 1.48, 1.75 and 1.12-fold risk of NHL subgroup as much as AA genotype, but there were also no statistically significant difference between each subgroup and control (p>0.05). It is concluded that the gene polymorphism of XPD (G23591A, G935931C) does not associate with the risk of developing NHL in Shandong populations.
