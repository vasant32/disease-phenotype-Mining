Clinicopathologic correlations were made in 50 patients with follicular large cell (FLC) lymphoma to better define the influence of a variety of clinical and pathologic features on survival and the potential for continuous freedom from disease. The 5- and 10-year actuarial survivals for the entire group of patients are 77% and 63%, respectively, but disease-free survival is only 46% at 5 years and 22% at 10 years. No significant survival differences were found with various treatment approaches, although a single relapse occurred after 3 years among patients treated with modern combination chemotherapy containing doxorubicin. Median survivals of approximately 10 years despite recurrent disease are characteristic of the majority of follicular lymphomas. Furthermore, the reproducibility of cytologic diagnosis among follicular lymphomas is known to be variable. At this time, it is unclear whether intensive chemotherapy will cure a significant number of FLC patients or novel approaches are necessary as for the other follicular lymphomas.
