 UNLABELLED: Bcl-2/IgH rearrangement is a characteristic molecular rearrangement in patients with follicular lymphoma (FL), yet its prognostic significance is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the implications of achieving Bcl-2/IgH negativity for the prognosis of FL patients. Twenty seven patients (54%) were receiving only chemotherapy (CHT), 23 patients (46%) were receiving chemotherapy combined with monoclonal antibody anti/CD20, rituximab (R-CHT). RESULTS: Molecular genetic remission was achieved in 7 out of 11 patients (64%) after R-CHT, and only in 2 out of 14 patients (14%) after CHT- this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.037). 4 weekly doses of rituximab were administered in a sequence to 17 out of 27 patients who had received only chemotherapy and failed to achieve complete remission. 12 out of 17 patients (71%) on this therapy were Bcl-2/IgH positive prior to treatment. 7 out of 12 (58 %) patients were no longer Bcl-2/IgH positive in a check performed after one month; the remaining 2 out of 5 patients had a negative Bcl-2/IgH record for the interval of 3 months (1 patient) or 6 (1 patient) months, respectively. The following factors were associated with the achievement of Bcl-2/IgH negativity at any point during the treatment: age < 65 years (p = 0.02) and performance status 0 + 1 according to WHO at baseline (p = 0.02). Patients who were Bcl-2/IgH negative after treatment had a lower recurrence/progression risk rate than the Bcl-2/IgH positive group of patients, i.e. 27% vs. 75% (p = 0.03), and a higher chance for progression-free survival, i.e. 81% vs. 38% (p = 0.004), event-free survival, i.e. 74% vs. 38% (p = 0.01), and overall survival, i.e. 87% vs. 74% (p = 0.05) at 2 years. CONCLUSION: In our experience, achieving Bcl-2/IgH negativity after follicular lymphoma therapy implies a better prognosis.
