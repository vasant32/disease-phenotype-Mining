The frequency of t(14;18) in follicular lymphoma (FL) in Japan has been reported to be low compared to North America and other European countries. Recently, it has also been reported that FL lacks t(14;18), mainly among histological grade 3b, and occasionally has a rearranged Bcl-6 gene. It is not known whether a difference in histology or immunostaining pattern exists between FL with and without t(14;18). We performed interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis to detect Bcl-2/IgH, Bcl-6 gene rearrangement, Bcl-2 gene amplification, and the cyclinD1/IgH gene in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded specimens from our FL archives. The correlation between morphological features, histological grades, immunohistochemical findings, and cytogenetical aberrations was studied. In total, we found that 28 of 47 cases (59.6%) had t(14;18). Bcl-6 gene rearrangement and extra Bcl-2 gene signals were found in five and two cases, respectively. Only one had cyclinD1/IgH fusion. Ten of 12 grade 1, nine of 17 grade 2, and 0 of two grade 3 cases had fusion signals, respectively. None of the above abnormalities were detected in 12 of 47 cases (25.5%). Our data confirmed a high frequency of t(14;18) in FL in grade 1, but a lower incidence among grade 2, that could be attributed to the lower incidence of the translocation in FL in Japan. Immunostaining of both Bcl-2 and CD10 was highly predictable for the presence of t(14;18); the positive predictive value was 75%, suggesting the usefulness of the staining.
