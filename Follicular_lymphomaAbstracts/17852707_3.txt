Aberrant hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoter region of tumor suppressor and other important genes in neoplastic cells of lymphoma has been demonstrated to be one of the mechanisms for epigenetic loss of gene function. In this study, we analyzed promoter hypermethylation of the following genes in 49 cases of primary gastric lymphoma (PGL): ATM, p16INK4a(CDKN2A), hMLH1, MGMT, DAPK, and CDH1(ECAD). The PGL cases studied included 26 (53%) cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 12 (25%) cases of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), 7 (14%) cases of MZL with large cell transformation (MZL/DLBCL), 1 (2%) case of follicular lymphoma (FL), one (2%) case of Burkitt-like lymphoma (BL), one case (2%) of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) and one case (2%) of peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Available pathologic data regarding to extragastric involvement at the time of resection of the PGLs were reviewed and correlated. Promoter hypermethylation was detected in 6 of 49 (12.2%) cases for ATM; 13 of 49 (26.5%) for p16INK4a, 19 of 49 (38.8%) for hMLH1; 22 of 49 (44.9%) for MGMT; 27 of 49 (55.1%) for DAPK and 16 of 49 (32.7%) for CDH1. A total of 85% of the PGLs had promoter hypermethylation in at least one of these genes. With different histologic subtypes, promoter hypermethylation of DAPK, hMLH1, and CDH1 genes occurred in 70%, 42%, and 42% respectively for DLBCL, which appeared to be higher than combined MZL and MZL/DLBCL subgroup. Approximately 81% PGLs demonstrated H. pylori infection by immunohistochemistry. H. pylori status did not appear to be statistically correlated with promoter hypermethylation of the genes. Of 37 PGL cases, 19 cases had extragastric involvement at the time of resection, indicating relatively higher stage disease. The frequencies of promoter methylation in those cases were 58% for DAPK, 42% for hMLH1, 37% for CDH1, 26% for p16INK4a and 11% for ATM respectively. The promoter methylation at MGMT gene was significantly higher in the PGLs without extragastric involvement (61%) as compared to those with extragastric involvement (26%).
