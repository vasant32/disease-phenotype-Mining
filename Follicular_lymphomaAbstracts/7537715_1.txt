In this study the distribution patterns of various extracellular matrix components and their receptors (i.e. beta 1 integrins) in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas were examined and compared to those in reactive lymphoid tissue. Neoplastic follicles within follicular lymphomas showed similar patterns to that observed in reactive follicles, which appeared to be strongly associated with the presence of follicular dendritic cells. Diffuse lymphomas of low and intermediate malignancy grade revealed features comparable to those of interfollicular areas of reactive lymphoid tissue, irrespective to which compartment the tumour cells were related. Highly malignant lymphomas, however, displayed unique extracellular matrix configurations, resulting from active matrix degradation by macrophages; this may support rapid tumour growth. Extranodal lymphomas showed virtually the same matrix patterns as their nodal counterparts, suggesting that (malignant) lymphoid cells generate (at least partly) their own specific microenvironment. In reactive lymphoid tissue beta 1 integrins were mainly found on resident cells and except for alpha 4, alpha 5 (and beta 1) the lymphoid cells expressed very little, if any, beta 1 integrins. In comparison, expression of these integrins on lymphoma cells was reduced (follicular lymphomas) or could not be detected at all (diffusely growing lymphomas); this might contribute to the growth pattern and metastatic properties of the tumours.
