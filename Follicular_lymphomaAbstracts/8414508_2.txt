Two rearrangements affecting the same allele of the BCL2 gene were characterized by molecular analysis of an untreated follicular lymphoma. The first rearrangement interested the major breakpoint region (mbr) on chromosome 18 and a JH segment on chromosome 14. The other one was located at the 5' end of the BCL2 gene, in the so called variant cluster region (vcr), and consisted of a series of deletions that removed part of a DNA region where initiation of transcription normally occurs. Interestingly, both rearrangements involved the same BCL2 allele. The simultaneous presence of mbr (or mcr) translocations and of minor rearrangements in vcr has been previously suggested by restriction map analysis in a significant number of follicular lymphomas. The significance of these abnormalities on the oncogenic process is discussed.
