In this series, the prognosis and the course of 180 cases of follicular lymphomas, classified according to Kiel's classification, seen before any treatment, treated and followed in the same institution were analyzed. In the first part, 6 primary prognostic factors were identified: compression, age of patient, stage, general symptoms, pathological subtype, lymphography. The most significant parameter (p less than 10(-10], obtained secondarily, was complete remission obtained in 63.9% of patients. In the second part, a multivariate analysis permitted to identify a few groups of patients for whom the probability of complete remission varied between 25 and 100%. Knowledge of these prognostic parameters may help to tailor treatment to each case and to obtain the best survival possible.
