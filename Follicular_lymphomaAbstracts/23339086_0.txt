By using the GRADE system, we updated the guidelines for management of follicular cell lymphoma issued in 2006 from SIE, SIES, and GITMO group. We confirmed our recommendation to frontline chemoimmunotherapy in patients with Stage III-IV disease and/or high tumor burden. Maintenance rituximab was also recommended in responding patients. In patients relapsing after an interval longer than 12 months from frontline therapy, we recommended chemoimmunotherapy with non cross-resistant regimens followed by rituximab maintenance. High dose chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplant was recommended for young fit patients who achieve a response after salvage chemoimmunotherapy.
