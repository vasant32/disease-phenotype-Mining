Genetic polymorphism in DNA repair genes may influence individual variation in DNA repair capacity, which may be associated with cancer risks. This hospital-based case-control study examined whether polymorphism in the DNA repair gene x-ray repair cross-complementing groups 1 (XRCC1 Arg194Trp [C-->T], Arg280His [G-->A], and Arg399Gln [G-->A]) played a role in susceptibility to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in the Chinese population. We genotyped these polymorphisms for 221 histopathologically confirmed NHL cases and 254 age- and sex-matched healthy control cases in China. No studied polymorphism alone was shown to be related to the risk of NHL or each histologic subtype of NHL. When stratified by smoking status, however, the XRCC1Arg399Gln variant genotypes (homozygotes and heterozygotes) were associated with a 3.0-fold risk of follicular lymphoma among heavy smokers (95% confidence interval: 1.16-7.82; P = 0.02). Further large-scale studies would confirm this association and clarify marginally significant trends in XRCC1 polymorphism combinations for an increased risk for NHL.
