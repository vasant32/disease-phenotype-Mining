The bcl-2 gene is rearranged in most cases of follicular lymphoma and the breakpoint clusters are found in two specific regions: mbr and mcr. Rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes (IgH) result in a deregulation of the gene and increased transcription of mRNA for the bcl-2 protein. In cases of rearrangement of the light chains (variant translocations), a third breakpoint has been described at the 5' part of the bcl-2 locus (vcr). In the present case, we report the molecular analysis of an FL transformed into a blastic phase unresponsive to chemotherapy. Molecular studies revealed a typical bcl-2 rearrangement at the major locus (mbr). Vcr rearrangements was also observed with only a single restriction enzyme. At the same time, SSCP analysis of exon 5 of the p53 locus disclosed an abnormal conformer. Direct sequencing revealed a point mutation at codon 163 (A --> G). Immunohistochemical analysis of the affected sites disclosed overexpression of p53 and bcl-2. It is concluded that p53 mutation can contribute to blastic transformation in cases of follicular lymphomas with double rearrangement at the bcl-2 locus (mbr/vcr).
