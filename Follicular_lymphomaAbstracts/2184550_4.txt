A case of centroblastic centrocytic follicular lymphoma arising within a bilateral adenolymphoma of the parotid glands with involvement of the adjacent lymph nodes is reported. The patient was treated with combination chemotherapy and three years after the first cycle of therapy there was no evidence of disease. The occurrence of primary malignant lymphomas in the lymphoid stroma of an adenolymphoma has seldom been discussed in literature. All cases reported of follicular centre cell type were characterized by an indolent clinical course.
