In a prospective study, we have investigated CD34+ selection of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) for autotransplantation in patients with lymphoma. Twenty-six consecutive patients (10 follicular lymphomas, seven mantle cell lymphomas, seven B-CLL, two immunocytomas) were mobilized using chemotherapy plus G-CSF. Sufficient numbers of PBPC could be collected from 24 patients and were immunoselected with the semiautomated Isolex 300 (n = 17) or the fully integrated Isolex 300i (n = 7) devices. The selection products were assayed by PCR amplification of clonal CDRIII or t(14;18) rearrangements for residual tumor cell content. Residual disease and long-term hematopoietic and immune recovery were studied by assessing the following parameters at 3, 6, and 12 months post-transplant: CDRIII or t(14;18) PCR, platelet count, lymphocyte subsets, serum IgG, serum IgA, and measles titer. With the Isolex 300 device 26% (10-65) of input CD34+ cells were recovered with a median purity of 89.2% (49.4-98.9) after CD34+ selection. The Isolex 300i device allowed significantly better recoveries (46% (22-86)) and purities of CD34+ cells (98.8% (92.2-99.2)). The overall purging efficacy was 3.2 (0.6-5.1) log. Twenty patients have been reinfused with CD34+ selected grafts after myeloablative preparation. Rapid engraftment occurred in all patients. With a median follow-up of 28 (19-42) months, 14 patients are alive without clinical or molecular evidence of disease recurrence, whereas five have relapsed and one additional patient shows persistent presence of the disease-specific molecular marker without clinical progression. Cellular and serological parameters of hematopoietic and immune functions were largely normal at 12 months post-transplant including the measles titer which was present in all patients. Kinetics of immunohematopoietic recovery were similar to those of 12 control patients who had received unmanipulated PBPC during the same time period except for the recovery of CD4+ CD45RA+ T cells which was significantly delayed in the CD34+ group. During the first year post-transplant, transient monoclonal or oligoclonal gammopathies were observed in seven of 16 study patients. We conclude that CD34+ selection with the Isolex system allows preparation of highly purified CD34+ fractions and effective tumor cell depletion. The CD34+ products can be reinfused safely after myeloablative treatment and result in sustained hematopoietic and immune recovery. The fact that all patients retained their specific measles immunity suggests that myeloablative treatment with reinfusion of highly purified CD34+ PBPC is not immunoablative.
