 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Bendamustine has been recently approved for the treatment of low-grade lymphoproliferative disorders. There is little data on the effectiveness or toxicity of this drug outside the trial setting. This is the first report on the use of bendamustine from the Indian subcontinent. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Retrospective descriptive analysis of response and side effects of bendamustine in eight patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and eight patients with follicular lymphoma. METHODS: Data was collated from a review of case records. We examined any association between side effects and clinical parameters. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 52 years and three-quarters had received prior treatment with alkylators or fludarabine. Three different protocols of bendamustine were used (single agent, in combination with rituximab or in combination with vincristine and prednisolone). The overall response rate was 80% (47% complete response, 33% partial response, and 20% progressive disease). The drug was well tolerated with very few grade 3/4 toxicities. More than half the patients (9/16) developed a characteristic erythematous, papular skin rash that resolved after completion of chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Bendamustine is a safe and useful addition to the drug arsenal against lymphoproliferative disorders. A peculiar skin rash was the commonest side effect noted in Indian patients treated with this drug.
