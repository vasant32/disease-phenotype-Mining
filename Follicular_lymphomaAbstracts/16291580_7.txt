We microdissected Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells from 14 Hodgkin's lymphoma tissue samples (nodular sclerosis = 5; mixed cellularity = 9), and after isolation and amplification of mRNA, analyzed the expression profile of 140 genes of chemokines, cytokines and their receptors by cDNA microarray methods. We also compared the profile with those of germinal center (GC) cells in reactive lymphadenitis. Unsupervised clustering revealed a relatively homogeneous expression profile in HRS cells. HRS cells tended to express mainly Th2 T cell-associated molecules rather than those of Th1, compared with GC cells. Interleukin-11 receptor alpha (IL-11Ralpha), a previously unknown HRS cell-specific gene, was detected in addition to known genes. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the expression of IL-11Ralpha at the protein level. In contrast, only few cases were positive for IL-11Ralpha in B cell lymphoma, diffuse large cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. This is the first analysis report of tissue HRS cells with cDNA microarray technique.
