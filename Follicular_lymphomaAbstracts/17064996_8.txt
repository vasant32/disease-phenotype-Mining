Several factors predict outcome for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) after chemotherapy. However, predictors of response to rituximab have not been identified. Baseline characteristics for 166 NHL patients (130 follicular) in a phase III trial of rituximab were analysed by univariate and multivariate methods to determine whether any of 27 factors predict response and/or response duration. In a univariate analysis, response to rituximab was associated with follicular histology, no prior fludarabine therapy, prior autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT), lack of bone marrow involvement or extranodal disease, positive bcl-2 in blood, and fewer relapses. By univariate analysis, longer median time to progression (TTP) and/or duration of response (DR) after rituximab therapy was associated with International Prognostic Index lower-risk group, multiagent chemotherapy, and low/normal serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or beta2 microglobulin. In the multivariate analysis, response to rituximab correlated with follicular histology, prior ABMT, multiagent chemotherapy, and no bone marrow involvement; longer TTP and/or DR correlated with low/normal serum LDH or beta2 microglobulin, high CD3+ cells, and response to last chemotherapy. The follicular lymphoma international prognostic index (FLIPI) did not correlate consistently with response to rituximab or response duration. Several factors associated with prognosis following chemotherapy did not correlate with response to rituximab or response duration. NHL patients can respond to rituximab despite having factors associated with a poor outcome to chemotherapy.
