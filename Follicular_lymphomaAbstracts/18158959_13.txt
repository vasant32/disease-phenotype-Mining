Although results of autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) for recurrent follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) have been previously reported, the long-term results and evaluation of prognostic factors in a large patient population receiving this therapy are difficult to find in the literature. To address these issues, we evaluated 248 patients with recurrent follicular NHL treated with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous SCT between 7/87 and 6/03. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system, 64 patients (26%) had follicular NHL grade 1 (FL 1), 98 (40%) had FL 2, and 86 (35%) had FL 3. At the time of transplantation, 88 of the patients (35%) had a Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) score of low risk, 87 (35%) had an intermediate-risk FLIPI score, 37 (15%) had a high-risk FLIPI score, and 36 (15%) had at least 1 missing value, preventing calculation of the FLIPI score. The 5-year overall survival (OS) for all patients was 63%, and the 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 44%. In a multivariate analysis, a histological grade of FL 3, a high-risk FLIPI score at the time of transplantation, and having received 3 or more previous chemotherapy regimens were significant factors for predicting a worse OS. In addition, the use of a transplantation regimen including a monoclonal antibody decreased the relative risk of progressive lymphoma. These data suggest that transplantation earlier in the course of the disease for patients with follicular lymphoma with use of a monoclonal antibody-based regimen may lead to improved outcomes.
