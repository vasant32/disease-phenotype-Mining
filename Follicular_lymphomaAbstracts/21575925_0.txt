 BACKGROUND: In advanced-stage indolent lymphoma, therapeutic approaches may vary from watch and wait, antibody monotherapy, immunochemotherapy, or dose-intensified consolidation up to allogeneic strategies. In this nationwide survey, representative hematologic/oncologic centers monitored current treatment strategies in indolent lymphoma in general practice. METHODS: Four hundred ninety-five centers involved in the treatment of indolent lymphoma including university hospitals, community hospitals, and oncologists in practice were identified and contacted. Thirteen percent of centers provided information on 741 patients, which corresponds to 10% of the expected national prevalence. Detailed data on 576 unselected patients from 46 representative centers (2 university hospitals, 25 community hospitals, and 19 oncologists in practice) for whom a treatment decision took place in the fourth quarter of 2006 (start, change, or end of therapy) were included in this analysis. Data were verified by monitoring the pseudonymized patient documents. RESULTS: Median age was 67 years (range, 17 to 95 years) and 65% of patients were 60 years of age or older. Concomitant disease was frequent with cardiac disease (29%), hypertension (28%), diabetes (11%), and renal impairment (7%) being the most typical combinations. Histologies included 39% follicular lymphoma, 26% chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 10% marginal zone, 9% mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and 16% other. Only 10% of the overall patient population were treated within these studies. The aim of initial therapy was curative in 35%, and physicians aimed at improved survival in 62% and palliation only in 54% of patients. Radiation (10%), antibody monotherapy (4%), chemotherapy (33%), and combined immunochemotherapy (31%) were the most frequent approaches. Applied chemotherapies included cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) (46%), fludarabine combinations (F/FC/FCM: 15%), chlorambucil (14%), CVP/COP (9%) and bendamustin (4%). Maintenance was used in 12% and autologous/allogeneic stem cell consolidation were rarely applied (both in 3% of patients). At first relapse, combined approaches including immunochemotherapy (49%), maintenance therapy (16%), and autologous/allogeneic transplantation (14%/4%) were more frequently administered. As expected, different treatment strategies and response rates were observed in follicular lymphoma (FL), MCL, and CLL. Interestingly, supportive measures including antibiotics (34%), erythrocyte transfusions (32%), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (22%), immunoglobulines (19%), antifungal drugs (13%), and erythropoetin (10%) were frequently applied even in first-line therapy. Overall response was 83% (FL: 97%, MCL: 95%, CLL: 74%) with a 39% complete response (FL 63%, MCL 54%, CLL 15%) rate. DISCUSSION: In this population-based survey, patients characteristics differed significantly from published study cohorts as did clinical strategies and therapeutic approaches. Thus, clinically more relevant studies in medically compromised patients are urgently warranted.
