BACKGROUND: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is being increasingly used to treat young patients with poor-prognosis low-grade lymphoproliferative disorders. We report our single-center experience. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six adults (four with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia, one follicular center cell lymphoma and one mantle cell lymphoma) underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Five received bone marrow while one received peripheral blood stem cells. Donors were HLA-identical siblings in five cases and an HLA-haploidentical sibling in one. The conditioning regimen included in five cases cyclophosphamide, TB1 and high-dose chlorambucil, without the latter in the patient with follicular lymphoma. RESULTS: Five patients successfully engrafted, while the patient who received the haploidentical marrow suffered primary graft failure. There were two cases of grade 2 acute GVHD and one limited chronic GVHD. Four patients are alive in complete remission (CR) with a follow-up of 17+ to 118+ months. Additionally, there is no evidence of residual disease by immunologic and molecular techniques in three cases, while one patient has residual disease assessed by molecular methods. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that allogeneic SCT can achieve prolonged remissions in advanced chronic lymphoproliferative disorders.
