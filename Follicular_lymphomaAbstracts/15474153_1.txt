We describe a novel t(16;18)(p13;q21.3) in a male patient with follicular lymphoma. This unique chromosomal rearrangement has never been described in patients with follicular lymphoma. The breakpoint of 16p13 has several hematopoietic neoplasm-related genes such as MHC2TA, a master regulatory gene for HLA-D, and BCMA, tumor necrosis factor receptor super-family. The majority of follicular lymphomas have a rearrangement of the BCL2 gene, which is a pathogenetic factor in their development. The diagnostic and prognostic significance of this new translocation is yet to be determined.
