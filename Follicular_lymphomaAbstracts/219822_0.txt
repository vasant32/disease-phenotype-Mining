A female patient presented with a lump in the right parotedeal region. A needle aspiration biopsy was performed which revealed numerous monomorphous atypical lymphoid cells with PAS-negative cytoplasmic inclusions. This raised the suspicion of malignancy. Therefore, the tumour was excised. Histologically, a nodular lymphoma of low grade of malignancy was diagnosed. The tumour contained many epithelioid histiocytes, sometimes with PAS-positive material. The case was difficult to classify after the Kiel-nomenclature, whilst classification on the basis of Rappaport's system was much easier.
