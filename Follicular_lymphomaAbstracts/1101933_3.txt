The initial results of a randomized clinical trial comparing intensive cyclical combination chemotherapy (CVP) and total body radiation therapy in the treatment of advanced (Stage III and IV) lymphocytic lymphoma is presented. Sixty-five patients have been entered and randomized according to stage. Of the chemotherapy treated patients, (22/27 (81%) achieved a response with 55% complete responders. The radiation group or those treated with radiation 27/32 (84%) responded with 56% in complete response. There is no significant difference in overall survival between the two groups. Nodular lymphoma (44 patients) responds more often and has s significantly longer survival than diffuse lymphoma (21 patients). Approximately 50% of the complete remitters have relapsed but reinduction of disease control was possible in almost all cases.
