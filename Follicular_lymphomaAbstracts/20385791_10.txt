Genome-wide association and candidate gene studies implicate different genetic variants within the 6p21 chromosomal region with different non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtypes. Complementing these efforts, we conducted human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and class II genotyping among 610 NHL cases and 555 controls of non-Hispanic white descent from a US multicenter study. Allele-disease associations were assessed by logistic regression for NHL and its subtypes. Statistically significant associations between HLA and NHL subtypes include HLA-DRB1*0101 for follicular lymphoma (odds ratio [OR] = 2.14, P < .001), HLA-DRB1*0401 for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; OR = 0.45, P = .006), and HLA-DRB1*13 and follicular lymphoma (OR = 0.48, P = .008). We further observed significant heterozygote advantage for HLA class I alleles and NHL, and particularly DLBCL (P trend = .01 for elevated risk with increasing number of homozygous alleles). Our results support a role for HLA in the etiology of NHL and its subtypes.
