Since 1975, all histologic subtypes of Stage III and IIIE nodular lymphoma patients were treated with a combination of radiotherapy and multiple-agent chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and bleomycin (CHOP-Bleo). Fifty-eight patients were treated through 1979. Treatment consisted of two cycles of CHOP-Bleo alternating with sequential radiotherapy to clinically involved regions, and further CHOP-Bleo to a total of ten cycles. Radiotherapy doses ranged between 3000 and 4000 rad delivered in three to four weeks. Forty-six patients completed treatment. In the other 12 patients, treatment was interrupted because of progressive disease in seven, and myelosuppression in five. Overall five-year survival and disease-free survival results were 82% and 47%, respectively. Survival for those patients who completed therapy was 93%. By histopathology, survivals for all patients were: poorly differentiated lymphocytic, 100%; mixed cell, 80%; and histiocytic, 39%. Disease-free figures for all 58 patients were: poorly differentiated lymphocytic, 44%; mixed cell, 65%; and histiocytic, 35%. The extent of abdominal disease influenced five-year survival as follows: 100% for those who had only occult disease at staging laparotomy; 88% for those who were Stage III on the basis of a positive lymphangiogram; and 50% for those who had a palpable mass or required an exploratory laparotomy for symptoms. Five of seven patients with progression during protocol therapy have died. No patients died as a result of myelosuppression. A number of patients developed complications during treatment, none of which were fatal. Eight patients developed herpes zoster, four patients developed transient radiation hepatitis, and four patients had miscellaneous complications.
