 BACKGROUND: Monoclonal antibodies have dramatically changed the treatment possibilities for follicular lymphoma. (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) is the first radioimmunotherapy agent approved for the treatment of relapsed and resistant follicular lymphoma patients. Long-term benefit was observed especially for patients achieving CR after radioimmunotherapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 65-year-old female patient with the second relapse of CD20 positive follicular lymphoma and multiple concomitant diseases was treated with four weekly doses of rituximab (375 mg/m(2)). (18)F-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET-CT) demonstrated only partial response to therapy with persistent PET scan positivity in enlarged abdominal lymph nodes. Therefore, it was decided to treat her with a 1200-MBq (32-mCi) dose of (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan radioimmunotherapy. No acute complications were noted afterwards. Hematological nadirs were reached 4 weeks later, with a platelet count of 24 x 10(9)/l that normalized within the next 2 weeks. The patient had neither infection nor bleeding complications. Eight weeks after radioimmunotherapy, the PET-CT scans documented only 3 lymph nodes around the abdominal aorta, maximum size 2 x 1 cm. The PET scan analysis proved no accumulation of (18)F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose in any lymph nodes or other organs and tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Sequential treatment with rituximab and (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan may be an interesting alternative in cases of relapsed follicular or other indolent lymphomas in pretreated or older patients with other concomitant diseases.
