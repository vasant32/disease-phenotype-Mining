Synchronous presentation of breast cancer and lymphoma is extremely rare. Few cases are reported in the literature. We describe a case of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast with micrometastasis to a non-sentinel lymph node and subsequent incidental finding of a low-grade follicular lymphoma in an axillary node of a 52-year-old woman. The characteristic immunohistochemical profile of the lymphoma is described.
