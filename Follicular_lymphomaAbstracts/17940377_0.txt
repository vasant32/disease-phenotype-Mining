Treatment strategies for follicular lymphoma have not been established. We report the outcome after combination therapy with rituximab and cladribine (RC) for 8 patients with follicular lymphoma treated between January 2005 and December 2006 in our hospitals. Median patient age was 57 (range 42 approximately 73) years. There were 4 males and 4 females. Only 1 patient had refractory disease, while the others had untreated disease. On the follicular lymphoma international prognostic index, 4 patients were in the low-risk group, 3 in the intermediate-risk group and 1 in the high-risk group. The median follow-up period was 36 (range 22 approximately 90) weeks. The RC protocol consisted of intravenous rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m (2) on day 1 and cladribine at a dose of 0.1 mg /kg per day for 2-hours on day 1 through 5. The median number of RC courses was 5 (range 3 approximately 8). The median interval between the 2 courses was 7 (range 3 approximately 26) weeks. The overall response rate was 87.5%. Grade 3 neutropenia was observed in 50% patients, although G-CSF was not needed. There was no apparent thrombocytopenia or anemia. Herpes zoster was observed after treatment in 1 patient. RC is considered highly effective and well tolerated.
