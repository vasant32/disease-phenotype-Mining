Genetic modifications of the BCL6 gene in lymphoma include translocations, deletions, and somatic mutations (SM) of the 5' noncoding region. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the major mutation cluster region (MMC) have been reported, including two substitutions (397G/C, 502G/A) and one deletion (520DeltaT). Clinical and biological relevance of these SNPs are unknown. Based on a case-control study, BCL6 SNPs frequencies were assessed in 97 t(14;18) follicular lymphomas (FL) and in 54 lymphomas with 3q27 rearrangement. Allele frequencies were similar in the FL and controls groups. The 397 G/C genotype was correlated to a higher-grade transformation risk (P=0.02). SM were observed in 39.1% of FL and were characterized by a clustering distribution (hot spots spanning position 420-435, 106-127, and 590-600). No correlation between genotypes or acquired mutational status and BCL6 expression was demonstrated. However, gel mobility-shift assays, using SNPs containing probes show results representative for protein/DNA complexes. This study demonstrates that the first BCL6 intron is a highly variable region as a consequence of both SNP and SM, which may contribute to biology and outcome of FL.
