 PURPOSE: To report a case of bilateral optic disk edema in a patient taking oprelvekin for radioimmunotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia. DESIGN: Observational case report. METHODS: A 38-year-old man with a history of relapsed non-Hodgkins follicular lymphoma complained of bilateral loss of vision following oprelvekin therapy for thrombocytopenia. RESULTS: Funduscopic examination demonstrated bilateral optic disk edema with exudates inferotemporal to the right nerve. The results of magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits and lumbar puncture were normal. The disk edema resolved with discontinuation of oprelvekin therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Oprelvekin therapy may be associated with bilateral optic disk edema. This has been shown to be reversible in a primate model.
