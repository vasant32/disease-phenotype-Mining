The treatment of low- and intermediate-grade subtypes of malignant lymphoma continues to evolve. Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) accounts for 6% of all non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and is generally considered incurable. Although high response rates can be achieved with initial chemotherapy, median survival is only 3-4 years. Intensified consolidation with high-dose therapy (HDT) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has been reported to improve progression-free survival (PFS), but most patients eventually relapse. Indolent lymphoma accounts for 35% of all NHL and is associated with a median survival of 9 years. Similar to MCL, it is also generally considered incurable, and the PFS also appears to be improved following HDT/ASCT. We initiated a pilot study to evaluate idiotype (Id) vaccination following HDT and ASCT for patients with MCL, indolent, and transformed NHL to evaluate the ability of Id-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) to induce immune responses, and to evaluate overall survival (OS) and PFS. We treated 15 patients: 8 with MCL, 4 with follicular lymphoma, 1 with small lymphocytic lymphoma, and 2 with transformed lymphoma. After a median follow-up of approximately 6.3 years (range: 1-9), PFS and OS at 9.05 years from time of ASCT are 59% and 52%, respectively.
