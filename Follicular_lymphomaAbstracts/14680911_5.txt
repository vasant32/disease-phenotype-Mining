In this study, we attempted to diagnose malignant lymphoma on the basis of magnetic resonance imagings (MRIs) and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI). Eighteen lesions (in eight patients), all of which had been proven histopathologically, were detected on MRI. The eight patients included five patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, one with B-cell low-grade MALT lymphoma, one with follicular lymphoma, and one with Hodgkin's lymphoma. Nine lesions were located in the submandibular region, three in the buccal region, two in the orbit region, two in the submental region, and one each in the palatal and tonsil regions. The diameter of the lesions ranged between 9 and 42.2 mm (average: 22.4 mm). The signal intensities (SIs) of the 18 lesions were examined on T1-weighted (T1WI), T2WI, and gadopentetate (Gd)-T1WI. One lesion in case 8 was excluded from DCE-MRI findings, i.e., the regions of interest could not be adequately set on DCE-MRIs. The contrast index (CI) curves of the remaining 17 lesions were prepared. All 18 lesions showed almost the same images on T1WI, T2WI, and Gd-T1WI, although they represented four types of lymphoma. The images showed homogeneous SI that was intermediate to slightly high SI on T1WI, slightly high SI on T2WI, and moderately enhanced on Gd-T1WI. Thus, the cases of malignant lymphoma in this study showed relatively characteristic features based on MRI; however, these features might be non-specific. The CI curves in this study showed a relatively rapid increase, reaching a maximum CI at 45-120 s, and a relatively rapid decrease in most lesions (14/17; 82.4%); on the other hand, the curves of 3 of the 15 lesions (17.6%) showed relatively rapid increase, sustenance of a plateau, and a gradual decrease thereafter. These patterns of CI curves may indicate characteristic features useful for distinguishing malignant lymphomas from other lesions.
