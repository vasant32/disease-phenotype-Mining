A 40-year-old female chemical laboratory assistant presented at our clinic with chronic conjunctivitis of 4 years' standing. We initially misdiagnosed her symptoms as giant papillary conjunctivitis. Topical treatment failed to produce an improvement and a biopsy was performed. Histopathological analysis showed bilateral follicular lymphoma, a subtype of the B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The patient was referred for radiotherapy. At follow-up 18 months later the patient was symptom-free.
