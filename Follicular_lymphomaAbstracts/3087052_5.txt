Six cases of follicular lymphoma contained an abundant plasma cell component. With immunoperoxidase techniques, this was found to demonstrate monotypic cytoplasmic marking for either K or L Ig light chain in five cases, and for IgA heavy chain only in one case. A histogenetic relationship between follicular center cells and plasma cells was suggested by cell forms morphologically intermediate between these two types and by monotypic plasma cells in the neoplastic follicles. The progressive differentiation of follicular center cells into Ig-secreting cells in these cases is likely to be the result of an alteration of the immunoregulatory mechanisms that usually block the differentiation of follicular lymphomas. Four of our patients presented with disseminated disease, three had extranodal presentation and four manifested serum paraproteins. Their median survival was 40 months; two of them died of disease. The published data and our own suggest that follicular lymphoma with plasmacytic differentiation is a malignancy of intermediate grade, with survival and clinical features closer to lymphoplasmacytic/lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma (LP immunocytoma) than to follicular lymphoma.
