Assessment of clonality either by demonstrating light chain restriction or showing monoclonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangement is a valuable and indispensable adjunct to diagnosis in hematopathology. The study of light chain restriction by immunohistochemistry on archival material is hampered by a very low sensitivity especially regarding low grade lymphomas of B cell origin. DNA rearrangement studies of the immunoglobulin locus do improve sensitivity markedly but for lymphomas of follicle center origin they are prone to false negative results due to hypermutations. Therefore we developed a new clonality assay based on the quantification of immunoglobulin light chain transcripts using real-time polymerase chain reaction technology, which is also suitable for the analysis of archival bone marrow trephines. We tested the reproducibility and sensitivity of this approach by comparatively analyzing a series of bone marrow trephines with multiple myeloma (n = 26), reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (n = 37), and focal infiltration by low grade B cell lymphoma (n = 29). We could raise the detection rate of clonality from an average of 17% by immunohistochemistry and 66% as assessed by polymerase chain reaction rearrangement studies to 83% by this new technique. Despite false negative results due to light chain hypermutation in some cases, the detection rate of clonality could be improved even for B cell lymphomas of follicle center origin (follicular lymphoma or marginal zone lymphoma) thus making this novel approach a valuable additional tool for the hematopathologist.
