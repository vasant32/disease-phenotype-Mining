Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent, sometimes, fatal disease characterized by recurrence at progressively shorter intervals and is frequently refractive to therapy. Genome-wide association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region on chromosome 6p21.32-33 that are statistically significantly associated with FL risk. Low to medium resolution typing of single or multiple HLA genes has provided an incomplete picture of the total genetic risk imparted by this highly variable region. To gain further insight into the role of HLA alleles in lymphomagenesis and to investigate the independence of validated SNPs and HLA alleles with FL risk, high-resolution HLA typing was conducted using next-generation sequencing in 222 non-Hispanic White FL cases and 220 matched controls from a larger San Francisco Bay Area population-based case-control study of lymphoma. A novel protective association was found between the DPB1*03:01 allele and FL risk [odds ratio (OR) = 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.21-0.68]. Extended haplotypes DRB1*01:01-DQA1*01:01-DQB1*05:01 (OR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.22-3.38) and DRB1*15-DQA1*01-DQB1*06 (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.36-0.82) also influenced FL risk. Moreover, DRB1*15-DQA1*01-DQB1*06 was highly correlated with an established FL risk locus, rs2647012. These results provide further insight into the critical roles of HLA alleles and SNPs in FL pathogenesis that involve multi-locus effects across the HLA region.
