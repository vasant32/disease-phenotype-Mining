Regional deletions of 6q are frequent karyotypic alterations in malignant lymphoma and are associated with an adverse clinical outcome. One such region of recurrent deletion is 6q16-q21; however, the specific genes affected have not been identified. Our objective in this study was to identify cases with deletion of 6q16-q21 in follicular lymphoma and to define a minimal region of deletion. A physical map of 6q16.2-q21 was constructed using map information from both sequence-based and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) fingerprint-based maps. Forty-three BAC clones spanning a 6-Mb region of 6q16.2-q21 were identified and obtained from the RP-11 library. Selected BACs were fluorescence-labeled and hybridized to a series of 34 follicular lymphomas with a regional 6q deletion detected by G banding. Twenty-four cases with deletion of the 6q16.3 region were detected. A minimal deletion of 2.3 Mb was defined. Our study has identified a limited region of deletion of 6q16.3 that may implicate four known genes in follicular lymphoma and possibly in other cancers. A BAC contig spanning a 6-Mb region has been anchored to the 6q16.2-q21 region. This map represents a useful resource for gene identification in this region, not only in lymphoma but also in other neoplasms with 6q alterations.
