We report a case of follicular lymphoma in which pulmonary cryptococcosis occurred with cladribine therapy. The case involved a 72-year-old man. He was diagnosed as having follicular lymphoma, grade 1, clinical stage IVA from a tongue tumor biopsy in January 2003. A total of 6 courses of R-CHOP therapy was performed, but no clear effect was found. A new cervical lesion appeared, so he was treated with a total of 2 courses of R-EPOCH therapy, and the effect was classed as stable disease. We started cladribine therapy (0.09 mg/kg, seven days of continuous infusion) from February 2004, and complete remission was achieved after 4 courses of cladribine therapy. In January 2005, an abnormal nodular shadow in the right S10 area was found on chest CT images which was diagnosed as pulmonary cryptococcosis by serum antigen and a trans-bronchial lung biopsy. We started fluconazole (200 mg a day, initially intravenous drip infusion, followed by oral intake), following which both the pulmonary shadow and serum antigen improved. Afterward, the fifth course of cladribine therapy and local radiation therapy were performed against a relapse of lymphoma, but cryptococcosis did not reappear. The prolonged bone marrow suppression after cladribine therapy was considered to be a severe adverse event. These findings suggest that it is very important to pay attention to any opportunistic infection such as pulmonary cryptococcosis.
