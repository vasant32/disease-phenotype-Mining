Although numerous options are available for patients with recurrent low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), responses are rarely durable. We previously conducted a phase I trial of fludarabine and paclitaxel in the treatment of recurrent low-grade lymphoma. The present phase II study was performed to determine the activity of fludarabine and paclitaxel in patients with recurrent low-grade NHL. Patients with histologically confirmed recurrent low-grade NHL were treated with fludarabine 20 mg/m2/day intravenously (i.v.) on days 1-5 plus paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 given by i.v. continuous infusion over 72 h starting on day 1. Treatment was repeated at 4-week intervals for a maximum of six courses. Twenty-eight evaluable patients were entered into this phase II trial. The median age was 53 years and the median performance status (Zubrod) was 1. Twenty-two (78%) patients had grade 1 or 2 follicular lymphoma, and six patients (21%) had small lymphocytic lymphoma. The median number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 1 (range, 1-3). Objective responses occurred in 16 patients (57%); nine patients (32%) achieved a complete remission with a median duration of 32 months (range 4-84+ months), and seven patients (25%) had a partial remission. Grade 3 and 4 toxicities included neutropenia (72%), neutropenic fever (34%), infection (13%), mucositis (7%), and neuropathy (3%). The combination of fludarabine and paclitaxel has clinical activity in patients with recurrent low-grade NHL.
