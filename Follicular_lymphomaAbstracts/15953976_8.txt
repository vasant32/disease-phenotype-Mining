 OBJECTIVE: Investigate the association between tobacco use and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). METHODS: Tobacco-use data were collected during in-person interviews in a population-based case-control study of NHL (N=1593 patients, N=2515 controls) conducted in the San Francisco Bay Area between 1988 and 1995. Odds ratios (ORs) for HIV-negative participants were obtained from adjusted unconditional logistic regression models stratified by sex. RESULTS: NHL was not associated with overall tobacco use, intensity or duration of cigarette smoking in women or men. However, ORs were increased for NHL among men who used any non-cigarette tobacco alone (OR=1.7), non-cigarette tobacco and cigarettes (OR=1.4), multiple types of non-cigarette tobacco alone (OR=2.1) and smokeless tobacco alone (OR=4.0). In analyses stratified by sex and age, ORs for NHL associated with cigarette smoking in general were above unity among those aged > or =60 years. ORs for follicular lymphoma were increased in men who used cigarettes and other tobacco, cigars alone and smokeless tobacco alone. Diffuse large-cell lymphoma in men was associated with use of cigarettes and other tobacco, and multiple types of non-cigarette tobacco. CONCLUSION: Our data do not support an association between overall tobacco use and all NHL in women or men. Further analyses are warranted in larger studies to evaluate non-cigarette tobacco use, tobacco-related biologic markers and genetic factors in the development of NHL.
