The distribution of lectin binding receptors in normal human lymphoid tissue and follicular (nodular) lymphoma was studied in tissue sections using a panel of lectin-peroxidase and lectin-fluorescein conjugates: Concanavalin A (Con A), Peanut agglutinin (PNA), Lotus tetragonolobus agglutinin (LTA), Soybean agglutinin, Ulex europeus and Bandeiraea simplicifolia. Two lectins studied, PNA and LTA were found to bind selectively to the cell membranes of follicular centre lymphocytes in normal lymphoid tissue, and to the neoplastic cells of follicular (nodular) lymphomas. Con A, in contrast, bound selectively to follicular centre macrophages (tingible body cells) and identified in follicular (nodular) lymphomas a population of dendritic-like cells not otherwise recognized and possibly corresponding to dendritic cells identified ultrastructurally. Follicular (nodular) lymphomas share the lectin binding properties of non-neoplastic follicular centres. The expression of receptors for lectins with blood group activity (PNA T-like, LTA H-like) on follicular lymphocytes may play a role in follicle formation.
