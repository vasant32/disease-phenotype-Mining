This study describes the ultrastructural findings in 16 cases of nodular lymphoma, and compares these with normal germinal centers in order to determine the possible germinal center origin of the lymphomas. Long branching desmosome-associated dendritic reticulum cells, characteristic of germinal centers, were found in all 16 cases of nodular lymphoma. Desmosomes were observed only between dendritic cells and not between lymphoid cells, and they were seen in only 1 of 7 cases of diffuse lymphoma. Cells comprising the nodular lymphomas share cytologic features, such as nuclear blebs and marked nuclear indentations, with germinal center cells. It appears that nodular lymphomas have a close anatomical relationship to germinal centers, although their actual origin from these sites is not established by this study. They are composed of lymphoid cells; we have no evidence to confirm the view that nodular lymphomas are derived from dendritic cells. Light and electron microscopic findings have been compared in order to establish the nature of large "histiocyte-like" cells in the nodular lymphomas. Many of these cells appear to represent transformed lymphocytes rather than histiocytes. They are more numerous in so-called mixed "histiocytic" lymphocytic lymphomas than in poorly differentiated lymphocytic lymphomas, which otherwise are ultrastructurally similar. This study casts doubt upon the existence of a mixed lymphocytic and histiocytic lymphoma within the spectrum of the nodular lymphomas, and indicates that a cytologic continuum exists between cells interpreted as poorly differentiated lymphocytes and those heretofore identified as histiocytes.
