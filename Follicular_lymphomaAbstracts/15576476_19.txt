Substantial research has been dedicated to the study of the relationship between genetic mechanisms regulating cell functions in tumors and how those tumors respond to various treatment regimens. Because these mechanisms are still not well understood, we have chosen to study the genetic makeup of 57 tumor samples from patients with follicular lymphoma (FL). Our goal was to develop a prognostic tool, which can be used as an aid in determining FL patients with tumors genetically predisposed to a successful treatment with the CHOP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, prednisone) regimen. To select relevant genes, high-density oligonucleotide arrays were used. There were 14 genes highly expressed in FL patients that responded well to CHOP chemotherapy, and 11 of these were involved in G2/M transition of the cell cycle, in mitosis, or in DNA modulation. A high expression of CCNB1 (cyclin B1), CDC2, CDKN3A, CKS1B, ANP32E, and KIAA0101, but not of the proliferation-related antigen Ki-67, was associated with better survival rate in a univariate analysis. CCNB1 expression had an independent prognostic value when included in a multivariate analysis together with the 5 parameters of the follicular lymphoma international prognostic index.
