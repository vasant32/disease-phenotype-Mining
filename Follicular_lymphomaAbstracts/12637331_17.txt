Hematologic stem cell rescue after high-dose cytotoxic therapy is extensively used for the treatment of many hematopoietic and solid cancers. Gene marking studies suggest that occult tumor cells within the autograft may contribute to clinical relapse. To date purging of autografts contaminated with cancer cells has been unsuccessful. The selective oncolytic property of reovirus against myriad malignant histologies in in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo systems has been previously demonstrated. In the present study we have shown that reovirus can successfully purge cancer cells within autografts. Human monocytic and myeloma cell lines as well as enriched ex vivo lymphoma, myeloma, and Waldenström macroglobulinemia patient tumor specimens were used in an experimental purging model. Viability of the cell lines or purified ex vivo tumor cells of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, and small lymphocytic lymphoma was significantly reduced after reovirus treatment. Further, [35S]-methionine labeling and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of cellular proteins demonstrated reovirus protein synthesis and disruption of host cell protein synthesis as early as 24 hours. Admixtures of apheresis product with the abovementioned tumor cells and cell lines treated with reovirus showed complete purging of disease. In contrast, reovirus purging of enriched ex vivo multiple myeloma, Burkitt lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma was incomplete. The oncolytic action of reovirus did not affect CD34+ stem cells or their long-term colony-forming assays even after granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) stimulation. Our results indicate the ex vivo use of an unattenuated oncolytic virus as an attractive purging strategy for autologous stem cell transplantations.
