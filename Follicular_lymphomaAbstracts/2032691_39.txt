We have studied 36 cases of monocytoid B-cell lymphoma (MBCL). We confirm the predilection for females (30 of 36; ratio, five women to one man). The median age was 65 years (range, 29 to 85 years). Monocytoid B-cell lymphoma characteristically involves peripheral lymph nodes (30 of 36) with a propensity for paraparotid or intraparotid nodes. Salivary glands were affected in five patients. Other extranodal sites of involvement included breast, thyroid, stomach, and soft tissue of chest wall. Eight patients manifested with Sj√∂gren's syndrome, one had systemic lupus erythematosus, one presented initially with Raynaud's phenomenon, and two had a monoclonal gammopathy. "Composite lymphomas" were encountered in seven patients. In addition, association with or progression to a higher-grade lymphoma, ie, mixed small and large cell (one) and large cell (six), was observed in seven patients and was associated with a more aggressive behavior of the lymphoma. Immunohistochemical studies performed on biopsy sections from 20 patients confirmed the B-cell nature of MBCL. An average reactivity of less than 10% of the monocytoid B cells with the proliferation marker Ki-67 was demonstrated, in keeping with the indolent behavior of MBCL. Despite our observation of follicular lymphomas frequently accompanying MBCL, the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation does not appear to play a pathogenetic role for MBCL, as determined by molecular studies for the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation and immunologic studies for the BCL2 protein. Our observations also provide support for the proposal that there is an overlap between MBCL and "MALT lymphomas" (those arising from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue).
