The MCL1 gene, recently identified in a myeloid leukemia cell line, has sequence similarity to BCL2, the gene at the t(14;18) translocation in follicular lymphoma. The chromosomal location of MCL1 has now been determined. The human locus (MCL1) was mapped to the long arm of human chromosome 1q21, using the methods of in situ hybridization and somatic cell hybrid analysis. In the mouse, MCL1-related sequences were mapped to positions on two mouse chromosomes (chromosomes 3 and 5), using haplotype analysis of an interspecific cross. The location of the locus on mouse chromosome 3 (Mcl1) was homologous to that of MCL1 on human chromosome 1; the second locus (Mcl-rs on mouse chromosome 5) may represent a pseudogene. The proximal long arm of human chromosome 1, where MCL1 is located, is duplicated and/or rearranged in a variety of preneoplastic and neoplastic diseases, including hematologic diseases and solid tumors. MCL1 is thus a candidate gene for involvement in cancer.
