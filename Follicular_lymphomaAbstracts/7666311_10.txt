Bcl-2 protooncogene, originally discovered at the chromosomal breakpoint of the t(14;18) in follicular lymphoma, is known to regulate the process of programmed cell death or apoptosis. The inhibition of apoptosis is thought to be one of the mechanisms involved in the development of tumors. To investigate the possible association of bcl-2 protooncogene with the tumorigenesis of neuroblastomas, the authors examined bcl-2 expression by immunohistochemistry in 49 neuroblastomas and 7 ganglioneuromas. The distribution of apoptotic cells was also examined by the TUNEL method (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling). Bcl-2 oncoprotein was detected in the cytoplasm in 40 of 49 neuroblastomas (81.6%). There was no correlation between bcl-2 oncoprotein expression and the clinical features of neuroblastoma. The incidence of bcl-2-positive tumors in ganglioneuroma was significantly lower than that in neuroblastoma (28.6%) (P < .01). TUNEL stained the nuclei of tumor cells in 11 of 34 (32.4%) neuroblastomas. TUNEL-positive cells tended to be located around calcifications in neuroblastomas in patients less than 1 year old. Examination of serial sections showed that apoptotic cells were distributed in the area where bcl-2 oncoprotein was not expressed. What we have observed indicates that apoptosis of neuroblastoma cells may be regulated by bcl-2 expression. Our observations suggest that the survival of neuroblastoma cells might be promoted by bcl-2 expression and that bcl-2 might be associated with the tumorigenesis of neuroblastomas.
