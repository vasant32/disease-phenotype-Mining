 PURPOSE: Long-term follow-up with updated time to disease progression (TTP) and duration of response (DR) data are presented from a multicenter, phase II trial of rituximab/cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) combination therapy in 40 patients with CD20+, B-cell, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Revised response rates based on International Workshop Response Criteria are also provided. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Enrollment began in April 1994 and consisted of patients with histologically confirmed, low-grade, B-cell lymphoma who had received no prior chemotherapy or who had no more than four prior standard therapies. Patients received six cycles of CHOP and six infusions of rituximab. RESULTS: Eight (21%) of the 38 treated patients were classified as International Working Formulation (IWF) A, 16 (42%) were IWF B, 13 (34%) were IWF C, and one (3%) was IWF D. Nine (24%) of 38 patients had received prior chemotherapy. Nine (24%) of 38 were considered poor risk according to the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index. Overall response rate was 100%; 87% of patients achieved a complete response or unconfirmed complete response. The median TTP and DR were 82.3 months and 83.5 months, respectively. Seven of eight patients who were bcl-2 positive at baseline converted to negative, and three of the seven patients have sustained the molecular remission. CONCLUSION: Although a cure has not been found yet for follicular NHL, the R-CHOP combination provides a lengthy response duration in patients with relapsed or newly diagnosed indolent NHL.
