The role of ras gene mutations in the progression of follicular lymphoma has been ascertained by SSCP-PCR and sequencing. A total of 40 transformed lymphomas were studied, 16 of which had a matched preceding low-grade biopsy. Only one transformed lymphoma was found to have a missense mutation at codon 12 of N-ras, resulting in an amino acid change of glycine to serine. We conclude that mutation within the ras gene family is a rare event in the transformation of follicular lymphoma.
