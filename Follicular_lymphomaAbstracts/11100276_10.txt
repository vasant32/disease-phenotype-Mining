This prospective phase II study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of early intensive therapy followed by purged autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) in patients with follicular lymphoma with high tumor burden. All patients received the VCAP regimen (vindesine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone) as conventional chemotherapy and DHAP as second-line therapy. Twenty-nine consecutive patients were included in the study. Twenty-seven patients were grafted, seven in first complete remission (CR) and 20 in first partial remission (PR). Preparative therapy consisted of cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (TBI) in all the patients. With a median follow-up of 6 years, the actuarial overall survival is 64% and the actuarial event-free survival is 55%. Two treatment-related early deaths were observed. Eleven patients were informative for serial PCR analysis of minimal residual disease after ABMT: two relapsed, four remained disease-free with PCR positivity and five were disease-free with PCR negativity. These encouraging results lay the basis of future prospective randomized trials comparing autologous stem cell transplantation as front-line treatment with conventional chemotherapy for patients with bad prognostic factors.
