A case of signet ring cell lymphoma is presented. This is a rare variant of follicular lymphoma, in which cytoplasmic inclusions of immunoglobulin create the light microscopic appearance of signet ring cells. Although few cases have been reported, the clinical features appear to be identical to those of follicular lymphomas without immunoglobulin inclusions.
