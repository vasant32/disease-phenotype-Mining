Major histocompatibility complex class I molecule expression is reduced in some malignant tumours permitting escape from immune surveillance and is therefore associated with a poor prognosis. Seven cases of non-Hodgkin lymphomas out of 300 cases of malignant lymphoproliferative disorders totally lacked expression of class I molecules as determined by flow cytometry. Clinical data confirmed a particular aggressiveness of these cases with frequent extra-nodal involvement, a poor international prognostic index, a histological high grade and a poor outcome leading to early death in five of the seven cases. A previous diagnosis of follicular lymphoma characterized by bcl-2 rearrangements was made in four of these cases. HLA-G (class Ib gene), which is reported to bind killer inhibitory receptors on NK cells, was absent from the cell surface. However, it was detected in three out of four cases at the mRNA level with transcripts encoding soluble forms. Additional analysis revealed other abnormalities: class II was negative in four out of the seven NHL cases and decreased expression of beta2 microglobulin was observed in all cases. Peptide transporter proteins (TAP1) were detected in various degrees by immunocytochemistry. These observations showed that total lack of class I or class II molecules is a rare event in NHL and is associated with a poor prognosis. This could support a role for specific autologous T cells in immune surveillance.
