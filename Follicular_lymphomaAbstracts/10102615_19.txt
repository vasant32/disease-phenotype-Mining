Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a common morphologic term for a biologically diverse group of lymphomas. The chromosome translocation, t(14;18)(q32;q21), and its associated bcl-2 gene rearrangement are generally associated with follicular lymphomas. Some investigators, however, proposed that the presence of the t(14;18) in DLBCL suggests a possible follicle center cell origin and might correlate with a higher relapse rate after therapy. The CD10 antigen is expressed in a majority of follicular lymphomas but is also seen occasionally in DLBCLs. In this study, we examined 26 DLBCLs for CD10 expression by flow cytometric analysis and tested them for the t(14;18)(q32;q21) major breakpoint region by a polymerase chain reaction-based method. bcl-2 protein expression was analyzed by an immunoperoxidase method. Of the 26 DLBCLs, 9 (35%) were CD10 positive. bcl-2 protein was expressed in 7 (78%) of 9 CD10-positive cases and in 9 (53%) of 17 CD10-negative cases (P = .4). The t(14; 18) translocation was present in 6 (67%) of 9 CD10-positive cases but in only 2 (17%) of 12 CD10-negative cases (P = .03). Five cases did not yield amplifiable DNA for analysis. In summary, no difference in bcl-2 protein expression was seen in CD10-positive versus CD10-negative DLBCLs, but CD10-positive DLBCLs were significantly more likely than CD10-negative DLBCLs to harbor the t(14;18) translocation. This suggests that CD10 might be a marker of follicle center cell origin in DLBCL.
