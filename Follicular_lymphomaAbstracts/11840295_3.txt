A spontaneously EBV transformed follicular lymphoma (FL) cell line, Tat-1, was established from the lymph node biopsy specimen of a patient with B cell FL, grade 1 in transformation to high grade disease. Tat-1 cells expressed lymphoid markers and developed tumor masses in immunodeficient mice. Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), Bax and p53 protein expression was revealed by Western blotting. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed P-gp expression. Cytogenetically, the Tat-1 cell line showed identical chromosomal alterations to that of the initial biopsy specimen, among which the most notable were the t(14;18) typical of FL and additional abnormalities involving chromosomes 1, 8 and 13. Multicolor FISH analysis delineated all abnormalities, including a t(1p;8q), a der(8)(8q24::14q32::18q21) and a der(13)(13q32::8q24::14q32::18q21). Further FISH investigations using a locus-specific probe cocktail containing c-myc, IgH and bcl-2 revealed fusion of these three loci on the derivatives 8 and 13, in addition to the derivative 14 IgH/bcl-2 fusion and an extra copy of c-myc on derivative chromosome 1. These results demonstrate an additional example of the deregulation of bcl-2 and c-myc expression through recombination with a single IgH enhancer region. The unusual molecular features of the Tat-1 cell line render it a unique tool for studies focused on cytogenetic alterations, expression of multidrug resistance phenotype and expression of anti-apoptotic proteins in FL.
