Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a low-grade lymphoma that typically lacks CD5 antigen expression. We report 3 cases of FL with unusual expression of CD5. All cases showed histologic features of FL, including effaced nodal architecture, follicular growth pattern, and a spectrum of grades from 1 to 3 using World Health Organization criteria. In flow cytometric studies, all 3 cases showed a light chain-restricted, CD19+, CD20+ B-cell population coexpressing CD10 and low-level CD5. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated an identical B-cell immunophenotype with weak expression of CD5 and coexpression of bcl-2 protein and the germinal center-associated markers, CD10 and bcl-6 protein. None of the cases showed expression of CD43, cyclin D1, or IgD. By molecular analysis, immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements were demonstrated in all 3 cases, and 2 of 3 cases had a t(14;18). These cases highlight the difficulty classifying these lymphomas by flow cytometric studies alone and emphasize the importance of recognizing FL in the differential diagnosis of CD5+ B-cell lymphomas.
