Despite the success of standard treatments in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), patients are often unable to tolerate aggressive regimens, and they require effective alternatives. Bendamustine is a bifunctional alkylator with unique properties that significantly distinguish it from other agents in its class. In untreated CLL, bendamustine has demonstrated rates of response and progression-free survival (PFS) that are superior to those with chlorambucil, with an acceptable toxicity profile. In the relapsed setting, combination treatment with bendamustine-rituximab (BR) has demonstrated promising activity in high-risk patients such as those refractory to fludarabine or alkylating agents. In untreated patients with indolent NHL and mantle cell lymphoma, BR has demonstrated a PFS significantly longer than that achieved with R-CHOP (rituximab-cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone), with significantly reduced toxicity. In the relapsed setting, br has demonstrated rates of response and PFS superior to those with fludarabine-rituximab, with comparable toxicity. In the United States and Europe, bendamustine has been approved for the treatment of CLL and indolent NHL; its approval in Canada is pending and eagerly awaited. Once available, bendamustine will benefit many Canadian patients with NHL and CLL.
