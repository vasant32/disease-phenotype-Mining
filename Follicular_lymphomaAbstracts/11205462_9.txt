PURPOSE: Investigators disagree on whether follicular large cell lymphoma (FLCL) behaves like other follicular lymphomas, with no plateau in the survival curve, or as a more aggressive but potentially curable lymphoma. We reported in 1984 results for 62 FLCL patients treated at our institution; the current report updates those results. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-two patients referred from 1973-1981, including fifteen (24%) patients with Ann Arbor stage I-II and forty-seven (76%) with stage III-IV FLCL. Seven patients received radiation (XRT) alone, forty patients XRT and chemotherapy, and fifteen patients received chemotherapy alone. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 14.7 years. The median survival was 5.1 years, with 21% alive at 15 years. The failure-free survival (FFS) at 10 years was 31%. Univariate analysis revealed that age, Ann Arbor stage, and the International Index correlated with survival. Performance status, number of platelets, and LDH correlated with failure-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: FLCL responds to doxorubicin-based regimens similarly to diffuse large cell lymphoma. Patients with FLCL have the potential for prolonged failure-free survival. Variables that predict the survival in aggressive lymphomas apply as well in this type of lymphoma.
