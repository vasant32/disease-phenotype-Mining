 BACKGROUND: The benefit of adding rituximab to anthracycline-based therapy for follicular lymphoma grade 3 has not been studied. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 45 patients with follicular grade 3 lymphoma who were treated with rituximab and the combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Response rate, failure-free survival (FFS), and overall survival (OS) were estimated and a historical comparison to CHOP-only-treated patients was made. RESULTS: The International Prognostic Index (IPI) distribution was 47% low, 36% low intermediate, 13% high intermediate, and 4% high risk. The complete response rate was 96%. Forty-four of 45 patients are still alive. Median follow-up for the alive patients is 3.5 years. The 3-year FFS rate according to the IPI was 80% [95% confidence interval (CI) 64% to 100%] in low, 81% in low intermediate (95% CI 64% to 100%), and 50% (95% CI 25% to 100%) in high-intermediate/high-risk patient group. The addition of rituximab to CHOP improved both 5-year FFS, 71% (95% CI 58% to 87%) compared with 44% (95% CI 36% to 55%) with P value of 0.019, and 5-year OS, 98% (95% CI 93% to 100%) compared with 75% (95% CI 67% to 84%) with P value of 0.0034. CONCLUSION: The addition of rituximab to CHOP provided a high response rate and excellent early survival. Poor-risk patients continue to demonstrate a high rate of failure despite the use of rituximab.
