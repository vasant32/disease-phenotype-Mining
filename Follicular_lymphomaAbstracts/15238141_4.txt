Haematogones have been extensively characterized in bone marrow, but not in the peripheral blood (PB). We studied 102 PB samples from adult patients with a sensitive flow cytometry method. Sixty-six of 102 samples (65%) contained detectable haematogones, ranging from 0.01% to 1.3% of white blood cells (median 0.06%, mean 0.13%). Of 66 cases with complete blood count data, 51 had absolute haematogone counts of 0.00037-0.105 x 10(9)/l (median 0.0054 x 10(9)/l, mean 0.012 x 10(9)/l). PB haematogones belonged exclusively to the most mature maturational stage. These findings have implications for PB analysis of minimal residual disease in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and follicular lymphoma.
