Twenty cases of malignant lymphoma arising in the thyroid gland were studied clinically, histologically and immunohistochemically. Nineteen cases were non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (15 diffuse and four follicular lymphoma) and one was a plasmacytoma. Immunohistochemical analysis of the lymphomas using paraffin-embedded sections disclosed that 17 lymphomas were B-cell type and two were T-cell type. The plasmacytoma was of IgG kappa type. The large majority of the lymphomas were associated with an underlying chronic thyroiditis. The 5-year survival rate of the patients was 70%. An unfavourable diagnosis was more likely when the tumour was diffuse rather than follicular, when it was of diffuse large cell type or of immunoblastic type and when there was cervical lymph node involvement.
