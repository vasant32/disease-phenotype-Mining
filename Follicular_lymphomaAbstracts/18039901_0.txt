Lymphoma is the most common nasal cavity tumor in cats, yet few reports specifically address the anatomic, immunohistologic, and cytologic features of this neoplasm. Fifty cats were diagnosed with lymphoma at necropsy, via biopsy or by cytology alone. Ten cats displayed multiorgan involvement, and in 2 of these the involvement was limited to the cerebellum and frontal cortex, respectively. Of the tumors, 41 of 50 (82%) were classified as nasal lymphoma, 5 of 50 (10%) were classified as nasopharyngeal lymphoma, and 4 of 50 (8%) involved both nasal and nasopharyngeal tissue. Histologically, all were considered diffuse lymphoid neoplasms and no cats displayed features of follicular lymphoma. Of the 44 cases available for slide review by the pathologist, 40 of 44 (91%) were classified as immunoblastic lymphoma, 2 of 44 (5%) as diffuse large cell, and 1 as diffuse mixed; 1 was unclassified. Of the 45 cats for which immunohistochemical stains were available, 32 were uniformly positive for CD79a, 7 were uniformly CD3 positive, and 6 had a mixed population of CD79a and CD3 cells. Epithelioptropism was exhibited in 4 of 5 (80%) cats in which there was sufficient epithelium present for evaluation. Of those 4, 3 were B-cell and 1 was a granulated T-cell lymphoma. In the 21 cats which nasal cytology was performed, 15 were cytologically diagnosed with lymphoma; the diagnoses in the remaining five cats were inflammatory (n = 4), normal lymphoid tissue (n = 1), or nondiagnostic (n = 1). The most common biochemical abnormalities were panhyperproteinemia in 26/46 (57%) of cats and hypocholesterolemia in 11/46 (24%) of cats.
