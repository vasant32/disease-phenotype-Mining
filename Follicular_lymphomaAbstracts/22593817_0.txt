The determination of prognosis for B-Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is known to be related to the multiple differences in tumor cell biology. Bcl-2 and Bcl-6 are two markers linked to germinal center B cells. Both markers are thought to have an effect on prognosis of mature B-cell neoplasms. Forty-four patients with chronic B-cell neoplasm were included; Bcl-2 and Bcl-6 expression by immunohistochemistry was examined. Bcl-2 protein was positive in 36.4% (16 of 44) of cases (62.5% of follicular lymphoma, 16.7% of mantle cell lymphoma and 30% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma); the positive group implying a bad prognostic effect of the marker in NHL. Bcl-6 was positive in 13.6% (6 of 44) of cases (11.1% of mantle cell lymphoma and 40% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) and its positivity implies a better disease course. Bcl-2 and Bcl-6 can be used as prognostic marker in NHL.
