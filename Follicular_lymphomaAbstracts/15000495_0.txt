 PURPOSE: Existing data suggest that conventional C(H)OP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) regimen may not be intensive enough to achieve molecular response, as measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) evidence of translocation (14;18)(q32:q21) for follicular lymphoma. This study was undertaken to study the molecular response rate of follicular lymphoma to C(H)OP-based therapy and to analyze prognostic factors for molecular response. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with pretreatment PCR evidence of t(14;18)(q32; q21) and at least one posttreatment PCR analysis after the initiation of the treatment with C(H)OP with or without radiation therapy constituted the basis for this analysis. The random effects logistic model was used to analyze the data. The following factors were investigated for their relationship to molecular response: gender, age, beta2-microglobulin, use of radiation therapy, Ann Arbor stage, and international Prognostic Index for malignant lymphoma. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 56 months (range, 23-153 months). A total of 135 PCR results were available, 33 from bone marrow and 102 from peripheral blood. Overall, there was a clear and steady decreasing trend toward loss of PCR positivity with increasing time aftertreatment. By univariate analysis, stage > or = 3, stage = 4, International Prognostic Index > or = 2, and no radiation therapy were adverse factors for molecular response. On multivariate analysis, Ann Arbor stage IV and no radiation therapy were independent risk factors for PCR positivity, both for the peripheral blood data analyzed alone and for all data combined. DISCUSSION: It is possible to achieve molecular response with C(H)OP with or without radiation therapy in patients with follicular lymphoma. Response rate depends on the Ann Arbor stage and radiation therapy.
