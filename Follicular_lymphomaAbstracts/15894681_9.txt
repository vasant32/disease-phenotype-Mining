We previously reported a positive association among body mass index, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the leptin and leptin receptor genes that are involved in body weight regulation, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Polymorphisms in the ghrelin (GHRL) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) genes were examined in the same population-based case-control study of NHL to further explore the role of genes involved in energy homeostasis and obesity in susceptibility to NHL. Ghrelin is an orexigenic hormone that induces NPY release and inhibits proinflammatory cytokines via its antagonistic relationship with leptin. NPY is a potent appetite stimulator controlled by ghrelin and leptin and also acts as a mediator of immune function. DNA from 458 cases and 812 controls was genotyped. Among genotyped GHRL SNPs, the variant allele for GHRL -4427G>A was inversely associated with all NHL [odds ratios (OR), 0.78; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.59-1.0] and more specifically with diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL; homozygous variant: OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.13-0.74). Another SNP, GHRL 5179A>G, decreased the risk of DLCL (homozygous variant: OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.10-1.2). NPY -485T>C, 1258G>A, and 5671C>T were in total linkage disequilibrium (D' = 0.99) and the homozygous variants were associated with an increased risk of NHL in NPY SNPs -485T>C (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.5), 1258G>A (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.5), and 5671C>T (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3-2.8). When stratified by subtype, the variant allele for NPY 1128T>C was positively associated with follicular lymphoma (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1-4.9) as were homozygous variants for NPY SNPs -485T>C (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.4), 1258G>A (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.5), and 5671C>T (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-3.0). These results add further support for the hypothesis that SNPs in energy-regulating genes affect risk of NHL.
