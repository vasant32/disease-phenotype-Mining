Although the small B-cell lymphomas show major morphologic overlapping, they have been recently shown to be distinct entities with several biologic and clinical differences. Therefore, the utility of a panel of paraffin-reactive antibodies in differentiating these neoplasms was investigated. Using clinical data and morphologic criteria, 134 cases of small B-cell lymphomas were grouped as those with (1) one strongly suggested diagnosis, (2) differential diagnosis between two types of lymphomas, and (3) small B-cell lymphoma without hints for further subclassification. With a panel of antibodies including CD5, CD10, CD23, CD43, bcl-2, and cyclin D1, most but not all cases could be precisely categorized. This panel confirmed the diagnosis in 96.5% of the cases from group 1. In group 2 it confirmed one of the two diagnoses in 81.5% of the cases. In group 3 it established a definitive diagnosis in 55% of the cases. When all groups were considered, a correct diagnosis could be established for 88.1% of cases; for 6.7% of them the authors remained with two possible diagnosis, and the broad "small B-cell lymphoma" was the only diagnosis for 5.2% of cases. CD10 separated most follicular lymphomas from other small B-cell lymphoid neoplasms. CD23 separated small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Cyclin D1 separated mantle cell lymphoma. The present study selected CD10, CD23, and cyclin D1 as a minimal panel for the classification of small B-cell lymphomas, yielding a final diagnosis in 88.1% of the cases.
