A 49-yr-old Japanese woman underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy because of nonspecific dyspepsia. Endoscopy revealed a flat elevated lesion about 15 mm in diameter adjacent to the duodenal papilla, the surface of which was uneven and covered with whitish granules. Based on the results of histological examination with immunohistochemistry (positive for CD10, CD20, CD79a, and bcl-2 protein, negative for CD5 and cyclin D1), a diagnosis of grade 1/3 follicular lymphoma was established. Systemic staging examinations suggested the lymphoma was restricted to the mucosa and superficial portion of the submucosa in the duodenal wall. The patient was treated with a combination of CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone) and monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab), in addition to radiotherapy. After six courses of this combination chemotherapy, complete regression of the lymphoma was observed. Although reports of small duodenal lymphoma (<20 mm or localized to the mucosa or submucosa) are extremely rare, the features of this case are characteristic of small duodenal lymphoma in terms of evolution around the ampulla of Vater, low-grade follicular type, occurrence in a women, occurrence in the fourth decade of life, and favorable outcome, and this type of tumor may need to be distinguished by pathogenesis and clinical behavior from various other gastrointestinal lymphomas.
