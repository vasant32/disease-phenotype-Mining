Combination chemotherapy with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, vincristine, and prednisone) and HOP (Adrimycin, vincristine, and prednisone, was used as treatment for patients with pathologically staged, advanced non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Among 204 evaluable patients treated on CHOP there were 71% complete remissions with 92% overall responses. Among the 216 evaluable patients on HOP there were 61% complete remissions and 88% responses. Complete remission rates among patients with histiocytic lymphoma were comparable to those of patients with lymphocytic disease. Patients with nodular lymphoma had higher rates of complete remission than their counterparts with diffuse lymphoma. This was noted with both CHOP (78% vs. 67%) and HOP (67% vs. 60%) induction therapy. Rapid responses were common, as more than 14% of complete remissions and 66% of overall responses were achieved with the first course of treatment. Patients in complete remission have been maintained with either cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (COP) or arabinosyl cytosine, vincristine, and prednisone (OAP). After 1 year, 86% of patients on COP and 80% on OAP are projected to be free of disease.
