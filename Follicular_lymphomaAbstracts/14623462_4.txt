Follicular lymphoma is characterized genetically by t(14;18)(q32;q21), whereas t(18;22)(q21;q11), a rare variant form of t(14;18), has been preferentially observed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We describe here an unusual case of follicular lymphoma with a t(18;22)(q21;q11), that progressed to diffuse large cell lymphoma with a novel t(2;6)(p12;q23). Spectral karyotyping revealed that add(2)(p12) and add(6)(q23) were derived from a t(2;6)(p12;q23). Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis confirmed rearrangements of the BCL2 gene at 18q21 and the BCL6 gene at 3q27. Our results indicate that a reciprocal translocation involving 6q23 could be implicated in the progression of follicular lymphoma and that t(18;22) may have a specific role in the pathogenesis of follicular lymphoma as well as CLL.
