Between 1961 and 1982, 66 patients with stage III follicular small cleaved (FSC) and follicular mixed small cleaved and large cell (FM) lymphoma were treated at Stanford University. Treatment consisted of total-lymphoid irradiation (TLI) to a total dose of about 4,000 rad in 61 patients or whole-body irradiation (WBI) followed by boost irradiation to sites of involvement in five patients. In addition, 13 patients treated with TLI received adjuvant chemotherapy, consisting of six cycles of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP). Median follow-up was 9.6 years. Kaplan-Meier actuarial survival at five, ten, and 15 years was 78%, 50%, and 37%, respectively. Freedom from relapse at five and ten years was 60% and 40% with no relapses after ten years. In a prospective randomized study of 16 patients who all underwent staging laparotomy comparing TLI with or without adjuvant chemotherapy with CVP, there was no significant difference in either survival or freedom from relapse between the two groups. Patients with limited stage III disease (without B symptoms, less than five sites of involvement, and maximum size of disease less than 10 cm) had an excellent prognosis with a 15-year survival and freedom from relapse of 100% and 88%, respectively. Radiation therapy may be a potentially curative modality in patients with stage III follicular lymphomas.
