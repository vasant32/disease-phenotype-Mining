Follicular lymphomas (FLs) localize in lymphoid tissues and recapitulate the structure of normal secondary follicles. The chemokine/chemokine receptor pair CXCL13/CXCR5 is required for the architectural organization of B cells within lymphoid follicles. In this study, we showed that CXCL13 was secreted by FL cells. FL cells expressed CXCR5 and migrated in response to CXCL13. Furthermore, we observed a synergistic effect between CXCL13 and CXCL12 (SDF-1), a chemokine produced by stromal cells in lymphoid tissues. The production of CXCL13 by FL cells and CXCL12 by stromal cells probably directs and participates in the accumulation of FL cells within specific anatomic sites.
