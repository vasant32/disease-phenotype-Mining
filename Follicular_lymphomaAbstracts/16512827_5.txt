The International Prognostic Index (IPI) is the most commonly used prognostic model for mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). However, the prognostic value of the IPI is limited. The recently published Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) is built on variables, which are pertinent to MCL. This study was conducted to evaluate the prognostic value of FLIPI in a population-based series of 93 patients with MCL diagnosed in a 7-year period. End points of the study were response to therapy, overall survival, and disease-free survival (DFS) according to the IPI and FLIPI. Applied to the whole series, the FLIPI identified three risk groups with markedly different outcome with 5-year overall survival rates of 65%, 42%, and 8% respectively. Notably, the high-risk group comprised 53% of patients. In contrast, the IPI only allocated 16% of cases to the high-risk group and had a lower overall predictive capacity. When both the FLIPI and IPI were included in a multivariate analysis, only the FLIPI was related to survival. Multivariate analysis of DFS also identified the FLIPI, and not the IPI, as independently significant. Thus, in the present study, the FLIPI was superior as a prognostic model compared with the IPI and can therefore be recommended as a clinical prognostic index for MCL.
