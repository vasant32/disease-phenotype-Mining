We have established three lymphoma cell lines, HF-1 from one follicular lymphoma (FL) patient, and HF-4 and HF-9 from another. All cell lines carry the characteristic t(14;18) chromosomal translocation and express constitutively the bcl-2 gene product (Bcl-2 protein). Cross-linking of their surface membrane Igs (sIgs) with relevant antibodies triggers a vigorous calcium signal in all three lines but only HF-1 is induced to apoptosis. Treatment with anti-Ig arrests the proliferation of HF-1 within 6-12 h, nucleosomal DNA fragmentation is evident in 18 h and a morphologically complete apoptosis is seen in 24-48 h. While bcl-2 was expressed at equal levels in all lines, the apoptosis-sensitive HF-1 line displayed a much lower expression of c-myc than seen in the apoptosis-resistant line. This finding challenges the concept that expression of bcl-2 per se renders resistance to apoptosis but that the balance between the expression of bcl-2 and c-myc may dictate the outcome of sIg cross-linking. HF-1 is a unique, phenotypically mature human B cell line expressing surface IgG. This cell line offers a new tool for investigations on apoptosis and induction of tolerance in mature B lymphocytes. Our results suggest that some FLs may be amenable to anti-cancer treatment based on anti-sIg antibody induced apoptosis.
