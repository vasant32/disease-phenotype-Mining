Although several etiological factors have been associated with mesenteric panniculitis, the exact etiology in some cases remains unknown. Herein, we present a retrospective analysis of 8 patients affected with this disorder performed between May 2000 and December 2006. In our series the mean age at which patients presented was 63 years. The majority of the patients were male (with a male: female ratio of 3:1). The most common clinical manifestations were abdominal pain (n = 4) and asthenia (n = 4). Three cases presented with obstructive symptoms and three had a history of abdominal surgery. Notably, seven had a background of tobacco use (five smokers and two ex-smokers) and one patient developed follicular lymphoma. A literature research was carried out to analyze our results and formulate a new hypothesis. In our opinion, we believe that the study of causal factors such as tobacco and its components is required due to the strong association found in this study.
