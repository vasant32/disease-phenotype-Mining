Manual counting of MIB-1 positive cells which has been suggested as an alternative to centroblast counting for the diagnostic grading of follicular lymphoma is a laborious task. In this study, the validity of automated measurement of the MIB-1 positive area is analyzed as an alternative approach. Archival MIB-1 stained tissue sections of 15 follicular lymphomas were assessed manually and automatically by three independent observers. Concordance correlation coefficients and coefficients of variation were calculated to study reproducibility and variability of both methods and to compare result from both methods. A good concordance was observed between the two methods. The reproducibility of the automated method was slightly better than the manual counting of positive nuclei. Measurement of MIB-1 positive surface area may be used as a simple and fast alternative to tedious manual counting of positive nuclei as a potential help in follicular lymphoma grading.
