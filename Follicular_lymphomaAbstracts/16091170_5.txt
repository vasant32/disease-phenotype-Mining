 OBJECTIVE: To describe the relative frequency, morphologic features, immunophenotype and clinical data of different types of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) and to evaluate the practical application of the 2001 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of lymphoid neoplasms. METHODS: 369 documented cases of B-NHL were further subtyped according to the 2001 WHO classification of lymphoid neoplasms, on the basis of hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization techniques. RESULTS: Amongst the 369 cases of B-NHL studied, 353 cases could be further classified into 11 subtypes. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, extranodal marginal zone lymphoma and follicular lymphoma were the commonest subtypes, accounting for 51.2% (189 cases), 14.9% (55 cases) and 10.6% (39 cases) of all cases respectively. Tumors in lymph nodes were seen in 158 cases (42.8%) and in extra node in 211 cases (57.2%). B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia and hairy cell leukemia were not identified. When comparing the diagnosis based on morphologic examination alone with the diagnosis based on both morphology and immunophenotype, there was a 80% concordance rate. Immunohistochemical study was helpful in reaching the correct diagnosis in many cases and could improve the overall diagnostic accuracy by about 20%. CONCLUSIONS: Amongst cases of B-NHL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the commonest subtype, followed by MALToma and follicular lymphoma. While morphologic examination forms the basis for lymphoma diagnosis, immunohistochemical study also plays an important role in further subtyping. A combination of both modalities are sufficient for arriving at an accurate diagnosis in most cases of B-NHL, in keeping with the recommendation of the 2001 WHO classification of lymphoid neoplasms.
