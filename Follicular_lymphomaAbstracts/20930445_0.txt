Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) has been developed as a useful tool for the diagnosis of diseases adjacent to the airway to be used in place of open surgery or mediastinoscopy. In this report, we present a 46-year-old man with a solid tumor in the mediastinum. Since no other pathological sites were identified, EBUS-TBNA was employed for tumor sampling. Sufficient tissue specimens were collected and the diagnosis of follicular lymphoma was established based on the combination of immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and FISH analysis. This report demonstrates the advantage of EBUS-TBNA even for the diagnosis of hematological disease.
