A significant percentage of lymphoid cells isolated from three lymphoid neoplasms (nodular lymphoma mixed cell type, mycosis fungoides, and SÃ©zary syndrome) had tetraploid or near-tetraploid DNA content, as determined by flow cytometric analysis. In each case, a morphologically distinct population of cells with large, irregular nuclei was present, the percentage of which corresponded to the percentage of tetraploid cells. In a fourth case (diffuse "histiocytic" lymphoma), cells were sorted on the basis of DNA content from the G0-G1 compartment and compared morphologically to cells sorted from the S-G2(M) compartment. The G0-G1 cells has clumped nuclear chromatin, lacked prominent nucleoli, and had a mean nuclear diameter of 10.18 +/- 1.22 micrometer. The sorted cells with S-G2 (M) DNA content had one to several prominent nucleoli and less clumped nuclear chromatin, and they were significantly larger, with a mean nuclear diameter of 13.76 +/- 1.59 micrometer (p less than 0.00001). These preliminary results suggest that, in lymphoid malignancies, certain morphologic characteristics of individual lymphoid cells are related to their DNA content (level of ploidy) and/or the stage of the cell within its division cycle.
