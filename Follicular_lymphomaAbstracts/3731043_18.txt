A total of 417 evaluable patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were diagnosed between January 1974 and December 1983 at the American University of Beirut Medical Center in Beirut, Lebanon. Of these, 179 (43%) patients had nodal lymphomas, and 183 (44%) had extranodal lymphomas. The commonest lymphoma was diffuse large cell (27%), followed by large cell immunoblastic (21%). The histopathologic pattern was follicular in 18% of the nodal lymphomas and in 5.3% of the extranodal forms. The most common site of extranodal lymphoma was the gastrointestinal tract (46.5%), followed by Waldeyer's ring (19%). Small intestinal lymphomas were three times more common than gastric lymphomas. Immunoproliferative small intestinal disease (IPSID) was diagnosed in 20 of 59 patients who had primary small intestinal lymphoma. Of the 34 patients who had Waldeyer's ring lymphoma, 7 had gastrointestinal involvement at some time during the course of the disease. Nodal lymphomas were associated with poor prognostic factors: 82% were diffuse; 77% had advanced disease at presentation; 77% had intermediate- or high-grade malignancy lymphoma; 40% had marrow involvement; and 46% had B symptoms. In children, the most common lymphoma was Burkitt's, and 80% of pediatric lymphomas were high-grade malignancy. In conclusion, this study delineates the special features of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in the Middle East: The presence of IPSID; the high incidence of extranodal forms, in particular the intestinal ones; and the rarity of follicular lymphomas.
