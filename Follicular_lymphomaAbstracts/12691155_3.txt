We performed a retrospective analysis of prognostic factors in patients with stage III and IV and high-tumor burden follicular lymphoma (FL) treated with uniform schedules and with a long term follow-up. Eight-hundred and ten patients treated with intensive, anthracycline-based, chemotherapy and adjuvant radiotherapy to sites of initial bulky nodal disease were the basis of this analysis. Age >60 years, presence of B symptoms, bulky disease, >2 extranodal sites involved, high levels of LDH and the presence of serous effusions all identified as worse prognostic factors in univariate analysis were subject to multivariate analysis. Three factors remained significant: age >60 years old, presence of B symptoms and >2 extranodal sites involved and these were found to influence overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). We developed a score system and only two groups (score 0 and 1 and score 2 and 3) showed statistical significance in OS. When the International Prognostic Index was applied to these patients, no statistical differences were observed in OS and PFS between the four groups. Comparison of our results with multiple previous studies showed a lack of uniform prognostic factors and adequate prognostic classification could not be performed. In conclusion, it is mandatory for multicentric international clinical analysis to define prognostic factors and search for a clinical classification, as in diffuse large B cell lymphoma, so as to define groups of FL for more aggressive or conservative therapy.
