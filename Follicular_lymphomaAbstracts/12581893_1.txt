Cytogenetic analysis of fine needle aspiration cultures was performed on 189 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma from South India. Successful karyotyping was possible in 97 patients (51.3%). Burkitt lymphoma constituted 56% of the cases studied followed by diffuse type 20%, follicular 8.8%, lymphoblastic 6.6%, and unclassified 6.6%. Characteristic chromosomal translocations were t(8;14)(q24;q32) [32.2%], t(8;22)(q24;q11) [10%], t(2;8)(p12;q24) [2.2%], t(14;18)(q34;q21) [3.3%], and t(11;14)(q23;q32) [2.2%]. Notable geographical variation of some structural abnormalities was the finding in the present study such as, lower frequency of t(14;18) in follicular lymphomas and higher frequency of t(8;14) in Burkitt lymphomas when compared with the Western studies.
