 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The International Prognostic Index (IPI), initially designed for aggressive lymphomas, has been successfully used in patients with follicular lymphoma (FL). The Italian Lymphoma Intergroup (ILI) created a new prognostic index specific for FL. The aim of this study was to compare which of these two indices is more useful when applied to a large group of FL patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: Both indices, IPI (age >60 years, extranodal involvement >=2 sites, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, ECOG >=2, stage >=3) and ILI (age >60 years, extranodal involvement >=2 sites, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, male sex, B symptoms, erythrocyte sedimentation rate >=30 mm 1(st) hour) were calculated in a group of 398 FL patients. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) associated with each prognostic group were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: The overall concordance between both indices was 73%. According to the IPI 122 patients (31%) were in the higher risk group, whereas according to the ILI 132 (33%) were; concordance between the high risk groups was 66%. The 10-years OS and PFS rates after applying the IPI system were 73% and 37%, respectively, in the low risk groups; 47% and 26%, in the intermediate risk groups and 25% and 2%, in the high risk groups (log-rank=69.2 and 41.3, respectively; p<0.0001). According to ILI index the 10-year OS and PFS were 60% and 34%, respectively, in the low risk groups; 59% and 30%, in the intermediate risk groups and 17% and 0%, in the high risk groups (log-rank=86.6 and 58.5, respectively; p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Both the IPI and ILI index, are useful for classifying FL patients into different risk groups. Although it seems that the ILI index has a higher discriminating power among groups, significant differences were not observed in identifying FL patients with a poor outcome.
