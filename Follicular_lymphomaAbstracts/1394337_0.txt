ImuVert, a new biological response modifier, was evaluated for toxicity and potential efficacy in patients with advanced cancer. This agent consists of sized, labile, natural membrane vesicles associated with ribosomes derived from Serratia marcescens. ImuVert induces enhanced in vitro macrophage and natural-killer-cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and has demonstrated antitumor activity in palpable animal tumor systems. A group of 39 patients with a variety of tumors, 25 men, 14 women, with a mean performance status (Karnofsky) of 80% and median age of 57 years were entered into this trial. ImuVert was administered subcutaneously weekly for a minimum of 3 weeks. A total of 183 treatments were evaluated. Flu-like systemic toxicities, including fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and hypotension were observed. Erythema, induration and tenderness developed at the injection sites. Myelosuppression, thrombocytopenia, anaphylaxis, rental and hepatic toxicities did not occur. All symptoms resolved within 24 h. Two patients with nodular lymphoma achieved a partial response and two minor responses were seen in patients with glioblastoma and melanoma. On the basis of ImuVert's biological activity, and tolerable toxicity it warrants further clinical investigation.
