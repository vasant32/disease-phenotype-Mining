Primary small intestinal lymphoma (PSIL) is a relatively rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, often complicated by bleeding, obstruction, or perforation of the intestine during the clinical course. The initial diagnosis and management of these complications are often difficult in PSIL, because the small intestine is usually inaccessible in routine endoscopy. Recently, total enteroscopy with a double-balloon method, called double balloon endoscopy (DBE), has been developed for the diagnosis and treatment of small intestinal disorders. We report herein on 4 cases of PSIL (2 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and 2 follicular lymphomas [FLs]). In these cases, DBE was useful in the diagnosis, decision to perform surgery after assessment of bleeding lesion, and treatment of the intestinal stenosis using enteroscopic balloon dilatation. Combination chemotherapy consisting of anthracycline, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone with rituximab was administered in 3 cases, and all achieved complete remission. One patient with FL of the duodenum was treated with rituximab alone, but with little effect. We conclude that DBE is useful in the management of PSIL. More PSIL cases must be analyzed to establish the optimal management of patients with this form of lymphoma.
