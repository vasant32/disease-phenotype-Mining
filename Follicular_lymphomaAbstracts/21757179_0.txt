 INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: There are few reports focused on neoplasms in the submandibular gland because they are uncommon and are frequently grouped with the other salivary glands tumours. In the classical studies, the proportion of malignancy reported in these cases is around 50%. OBJECTIVES: Determining the proportion of malignancy, the most frequent histological types, the gender distribution and average age at diagnosis in patients with submandibular gland neoplasms who were treated in our hospital from 2000 year to 2010. METHODS: A retrospective review of our department database of the patients who underwent surgery for submandibular gland neoplasm in a ten-year period was performed. RESULTS: Twenty-two patient records were included, in which 19 (86%) patients presented benign disease and 3 were of a malignant type (adenocarcinoma, well-differentiated epidermoid carcinoma, follicular lymphoma). Two of the 3 cases of malignant neoplasms were in men. CONCLUSIONS: A greater proportion of benign neoplasm was found in submandibular tumours. The most frequent benign tumour is the pleomorphic adenoma. Women are more commonly affected (76%). Benign tumours appear in younger patients than do malignant ones.
