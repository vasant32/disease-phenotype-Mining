PURPOSE: To analyse the initial and evolutive characteristics of the patients with low-grade lymphoma and long survival (> or = 12 years). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The initial data (clinical, laboratory, histologic type, stage) and the clinical course (response to therapy, response duration) of 52 patients with low-grade lymphoma diagnosed before 1980 were analysed. The statistical study was carried out by means of the chi-square test with Yates' correction and Student's t; the actuarial survival was estimated, and the duration of remission was assessed by the Kaplan and Meier method. Curves were compared by the log rank method. RESULTS: The 12-year survival as a whole was 32% (CI: 95%: 18.5%-45.5%). Of the 52 patients, 13 (25%) survived over 12 years. Nine were men and 4 women, with median age of 41 years (range: 22-68 years). Three cases had lymphocytic lymphoma and 10 had follicular lymphoma; 2 were in stage I-II and 11 in stage III-IV. Those patients who would become long-survivors had at diagnosis lesser frequency of spread lymph-node regional involvement (> or = 3 sites): 46% vs 81.8%, p = 0.04, as well as lesser percentage of bone-marrow involvement (38.4% vs 78.1%, p = 0.023). They were also better responders to treatment (CR+PR = 100% vs 71%, p = 0.013) and with longer duration (actuarial median duration of response 8 years vs 1.5 years, p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: According to the present analysis, low-grade lymphoma patients who have at diagnosis low tumoral involvement (not too extensive lymph-node involvement, disease-free bone-marrow) and show good response to treatment have a better prognosis and may hope for a longer survival.
