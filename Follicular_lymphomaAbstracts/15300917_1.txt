A 59-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of recurrent follicular lymphoma (FL). Colonoscopic examination revealed a rectal submucosal tumor (SMT) without any erosions and ulcers. In this patient, it was difficult to distinguish non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) invasion from other disorders of the colon including carcinoid tumor merely based on endoscopic findings. Histopathologic and immunohistochemical studies on biopsy specimens showed an infiltration of atypical lymphocytes that were positive for CD20 and BCL2 but negative for UCHL-1. Fluorescence in situ hybridization on paraffin-embedded tissue sections (T-FISH) identified a translocation of BCL2 with IGH gene. Based on these findings, the tumor was defined as an invasion of FL. T-FISH method is useful for the detection of a monoclonality of atypical lymphocytes in an SMT of the gastrointestinal tract, and particularly for the detection of chromosomal translocations specific to lymphoma subtypes.
