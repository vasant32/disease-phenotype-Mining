 PURPOSE: To determine overall response rate (ORR), time to progression (TTP), and duration of response (DOR) with twice-weekly/weekly bortezomib plus rituximab, and evaluate safety/tolerability, in patients with relapsed or refractory CD20(+) follicular lymphoma (FL) or marginal-zone lymphoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned (minimization method) to bortezomib 1.3 mg/m(2) twice weekly (days 1, 4, 8, and 11; 21-day cycle, five cycles; arm A) or bortezomib 1.6 mg/m(2) weekly (days 1, 8, 15, and 22; 35-day cycle, three cycles; arm B) plus rituximab 375 mg/m(2) weekly for 4 weeks (both arms). Response/progression was determined by International Workshop Response Criteria using oncologist/radiologist-adjudicated data from independent radiology review and investigator assessment. RESULTS: Eighty-one patients (arm A, n = 41; arm B, n = 40) were enrolled. Dose-intensity was higher in arm A; mean total bortezomib received was similar between arms (18.5 and 17.1 mg/m(2)). In arm A, ORR was 49% (14% complete response [CR]/CR unconfirmed [CRu]), median TTP was 7.0 months, and median DOR was not reached. In arm B, ORR was 43% (10% CR/CRu), and median TTP/DOR were 10.0/9.3 months. The weekly combination regimen seemed better tolerated. Grade 3 or worse adverse events seemed more common in arm A (54%) versus arm B (35%), including thrombocytopenia (10% v 0%) and peripheral neuropathy (10% v 5%), but diarrhea seemed less frequent (7% v 15%). No grade 4 toxicities were reported in arm B. CONCLUSION: Both bortezomib plus rituximab regimens seem feasible in relapsed or refractory indolent lymphomas. The more convenient weekly combination regimen is being compared with single-agent rituximab in an ongoing phase III study in relapsed FL.
