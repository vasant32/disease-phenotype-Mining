PURPOSE: The object of this study was to compare the relative sensitivities of morphologic, immunophenotypic, gene rearrangement, cytogenetic, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses in the detection of lymphoma cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of patients with follicular lymphoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Bone marrow and peripheral-blood samples from 28 newly diagnosed patients with follicular lymphoma referred from several different medical centers were assessed. Routine morphologic assessment was performed initially and the remainder of the sample was aliquoted for DNA extraction to be used for gene rearrangement and PCR analyses and for immunophenotypic and cytogenetic analyses where a sufficient amount of sample remained. RESULTS: Morphologic assessment of the bone marrow was positive for lymphoma cells in 11 of 28 patients. PCR amplification of t(14;18) breakpoint DNA detected lymphoma cells in 17 of 24 patients assessed. Morphologic assessment detected lymphoma cells in three bone marrow samples that were negative by PCR. PCR analysis was the only method able to detect circulating lymphoma cells in peripheral blood at diagnosis and was positive in 15 of 24 samples. The other methods of assessment did not show lymphoma in any samples in which lymphoma was not detected by morphologic or PCR analysis. Lymphoma cells were found in the bone marrow and/or peripheral blood as frequently in early-stage patients as in advanced-stage patients. CONCLUSION: PCR amplification of t(14;18) breakpoint DNA together with morphologic assessment had the highest yield of detecting lymphoma cells in the bone marrow and/or peripheral blood of our population of newly diagnosed patients with follicular lymphoma. The clinical significance and prognostic importance of lymphoma cells detected by PCR in the bone marrow and/or peripheral blood of newly diagnosed follicular lymphoma patients awaits long-term follow-up data of these and additional patients.
