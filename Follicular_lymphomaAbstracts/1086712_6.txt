A case of long-standing, nodular malignant lymphoma of lymphocytic type associated with nephrotic syndrome and systemic amyloidosis is presented. Review of literature revealed only six previously reported cases of systemic amyloidosis complicating non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Recent studies have revealed that all of the nodular lymphomas are B-lymphocyte malignancies; that nodular lymphomas have high incidence (46-64%) of abnormality of intracellular immunoglobulin synthesis; that abnormality of serum immunoglobulin in such patients in uncommon (0-8%); and that at least one type of amyloid fibrils is made up of immunoglobulin light chains. These findings would suggest that there is an etiologic relationship between nodular lymphoma and systemic amyloidosis.
