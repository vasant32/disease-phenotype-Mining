Tissue P-glycoprotein immunostaining was performed in seventy one patients with follicular large, mixed, or small cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Only six patients (8.5%) demonstrated positive immunostaining for P-glycoprotein. All patients had complete and durable responses to initial therapy. P-glycoprotein (MDR) fails to predict for primary drug resistance in follicular lymphomas and is constitutionally expressed in only a few follicular lymphomas at present.
