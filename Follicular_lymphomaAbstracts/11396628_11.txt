Structural alterations in the meshwork of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) are frequently found in malignant lymphomas. Formaldehyde fixation and paraffin embedding, however, have long prevented consistent detection of FDCs. Wet heat-induced epitope retrieval in Dako Target Retrieval Solution (TRS) (pH 6.0) enabled the reliable detection of FDCs through CD21, CD23, and CD35 antigens in routinely processed tissues from 11 reactive and 69 neoplastic lymphoproliferations, thus allowing the distribution of the FDCs to be reevaluated. Germinal center FDCs in lymphoid hyperplasias and expanded FDC meshworks in the 8 mantle cell lymphomas, 7 low-grade MALT lymphomas, and 6 low-grade follicular lymphomas were intensely stained with all these markers. In 6 cases of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, tumor cells were CD23+. In four cases of nodular lymphocyte predominance Hodgkin's disease (HD), expanded FDC meshwork's sharply delineating negative tumor cells and their rosetting T cell, were revealed mainly with the CD21 and CD35 antibodies. Follicular dendritic cells were also demonstrated in 11 cases of grade I nodular sclerosing HD, including follicular HD. Striking dendritic cell clusters were revealed with all 3 antibodies in 9 angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphomas. Sparse or no FDC meshworks were detected in the 4 cases of grade II nodular sclerosing HD, 5 follicular lymphomas with high-grade transformation, and 5 T cell-rich B cell lymphomas. CD35 immunostaining showed the most consistent labeling in the four FDC sarcomas studied in the current article. Reproducible demonstration of FDCs in routinely processed paraffin sections with CD21, CD23, and CD35 antibodies, as presented here, provides invaluable pieces of information in the diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disorders.
