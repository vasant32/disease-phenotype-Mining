While the use of radioimmunotherapy for lymphoma increases, the feasibility and efficacy of autologous stem cell transplant for subsequent relapse remains unknown. We report a 48-year-old male with transformed follicular mixed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. After treatment with three different combination chemotherapy regimens, at relapse he received radioimmunotherapy with iodine (131)I tositumomab (anti-CD20), with very good response. At later relapse, a second course of (131)I tositumomab was given unsuccessfully. He underwent peripheral blood stem cell harvest, chemoradiotherapy conditioning and autologous transplantation with prompt engraftment and without significant complications. He remains in complete remission with normal blood counts 25 months post autograft.
