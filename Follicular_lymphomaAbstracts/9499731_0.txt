Subclassification of malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is important to be able to choose the right treatment. However, this subclassification can be difficult, and immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction are used to improve diagnostic safety. We have investigated the value of immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction in the subclassification of 49 low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of B-cell type. Immunohistochemistry showed B-cell phenotype in all biopsies, and 23 (85%) of 27 follicular lymphomas showed positive reaction for bcl-2 antibodies in follicles. Polymerase chain reaction demonstrated a monoclonal pattern for IgH in 36 (73%) of 49 biopsies, and 10 (37%) of 27 follicular lymphomas demonstrated translocation (14; 18). Immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction contributed to subclassification or confirmation of the diagnosis of 46 (94%) of 49 biopsies. Our conclusion is that immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction have a natural place in the diagnosis of lymphomas.
