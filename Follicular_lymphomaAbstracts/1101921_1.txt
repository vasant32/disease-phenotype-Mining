Staging laparotomy was performed in 106 selected untreated adults and in 6 children. In adults the histological pattern at initial biopsy was interpreted as nodular lymphoma in 33% and as diffuse lymphoma in 67%. Diffuse histiocytic was the most frequently observed histological subtype in the present series (54%). Diffuse undifferentiated lymphoma was noted in 2/6 children. Waldeyer's ring involvement was noted in 27% of adult patients. Systemic symptoms were present in 7%. Surgery detected occult lesions in 27% of patients (para-aortic nodes 3%, spleen 12%, liver 12%, coeliac nodes 15%, splenic hilar nodes 26%, mesenteric nodes 15%, gastrointestinal tract 1%, bone marrow 12%). The chance of detecting splenic and hepatic involvement was definitely higher in patients with nodal disease above and below the diaphragm in comparison with those with either supra-diaphragmatic or infra-diaphragmatic adenopathy. Lymphography yielded a 96% accuracy proving once more to be a sufficiently reliable diagnostic method. Staging laparotomy is a useful procedure in non-Hodgkin's lymphomata in order to gain information on the natural history and to plan treatment. It remains to be determined whether findings observed through surgical staging will lead to improved treatment and survival.
