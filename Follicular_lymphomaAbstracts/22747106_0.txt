Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent lymphoma that generally responds well to treatment. However, individuals with FL commonly face multiple complex treatment decision-making (TDM) experiences because it frequently follows a relapsing and remitting course. This study explored TDM and distress among individuals with FL (N = 32). Results indicated that most participants reported little decisional conflict or regret and wanted to be actively involved in TDM. However, more than 25% of participants reported clinically-relevant cancer-specific distress, and 60% indicated moderate or higher anxiety symptoms. Research is needed to clarify the cause and course of the psychological distress revealed in this study.
