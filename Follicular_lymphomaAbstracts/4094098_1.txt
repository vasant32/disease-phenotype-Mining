A retrospective histological study based on biopsy material of 341 cases of malignant lymphoma diagnosed at the Department of Pathology of the Seoul National University from 1976 through 1983 was conducted, to reveal some characteristics of malignant lymphomas occurring in Korea. Malignant lymphoma was the seventh most common malignant tumor (4.03%) among Koreans. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma predominated over Hodgkin's disease, accounting for 87% of all malignant lymphomas. Follicular lymphoma was rarely seen in Korea (3%), and among types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma the diffuse histiocytic type (57%) and the poorly differentiated lymphocytic type (26%) of Rappaport were common. Follicular center cell lymphomas (Lukes-Collins) were most commonly seen, whereas T-cell lymphoma was found in approximately 10% of the non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Not a single case of pleomorphic adult T-cell lymphoma was encountered in this series. Among subtypes of Hodgkin's disease the nodular sclerosis type was particularly rare, comprising only 15% of the Hodgkin's disease cases.
