Ongoing research on the differentiation between small-cell and large-cell follicular lymphomas ascertained that image analysis by three-dimensional morphologic transforms permits subtyping of follicular lymphomas with greater accuracy and reproducibility than can be accomplished visually by expert pathologists. The present studies improved the use and interpretation of the minimum tracking algorithm and identical to-filters (binary ranking filters). These filters operate on the voxels that constitute the three-dimensional space encodings of gray-level images and are implemented by the Triakis software system.
