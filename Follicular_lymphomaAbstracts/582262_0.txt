Nine cases of follicular lymphoma were studied by scanning electron microscopy. The morphological findings by this method emphasizes the heterogeneity of the cellular composition of the follicles, even in the cases not labelled as mixed type, and the degree to which the anatomy of a normal secondary follicle is mimicked. Large nonlymphoid cells, presumably dendritic, are present in the follicles. There are no differences in the surface features of the follicular and interfollicular lymphoid cells.
