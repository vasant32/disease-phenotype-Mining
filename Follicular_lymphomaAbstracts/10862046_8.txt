Most entities of B-cell malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) are characterized by typical primary chromosomal changes such as the t(14;18) in follicular lymphoma or the t(11;14) in mantle cell lymphoma. In contrast, marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (MZBL), arising at different nodal and extranodal sites, are poorly characterized on the genetic level. We performed cytogenetic investigations in 20 splenic and in 10 nodal MZBL and analyzed 52 MZBL (including 12 MALT-type lymphomas) for deletions of TP53, D13S25, and RB1 loci by fluorescence in situ hybridization. A new nonrandom chromosomal aberration, del(10)(q22q24), was found as a clonal anomaly in 3 out of 20 cases of splenic MZBL. Further recurring abnormalities such as del(7q) or trisomy 3 were found to be characteristic chromosomal changes in a subset of splenic MZBL. TP53 was deleted in 5/25 cases of splenic MZBL. Deletions involving band 13q14 were only rarely encountered, challenging a previous report that stated a dissociated D13S25-RB1 status as characteristic in splenic MZBL. There are fundamental differences between the different subtypes of marginal zone lymphomas as defined with current classification schemes. Splenic MZBL, in contrast to most other entities of B-cell NHL, seems to constitute a heterogeneous disease especially with regard to genetic alterations. del(10)(q22q24) could be of importance at least in a subset of this lymphoma entity.
