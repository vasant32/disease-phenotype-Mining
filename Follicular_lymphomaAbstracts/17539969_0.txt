Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is used as curative therapy for malignant lymphoma, and reduced-intensity hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (RIST) is sometimes performed to avoid the toxicity and mortality associated with myeloablative allo-SCT. RIST is generally preferred for elderly patients with malignant lymphoma. A 62-year-old woman with follicular lymphoma (FL) involving bone marrow (BM) suffered relapse after autologous SCT. RIST was performed; cells were from an unrelated, fully human leukocyte antigen-matched donor. To study the hematopoietic reconstitution, BM biopsy specimens that were obtained at different times after RIST, were evaluated. Engraftment of donor cells was observed on days 19 and 48 after RIST, and residual FL in BM had completely disappeared by day 73 after RIST. This is the first report to document histological BM regeneration after RIST and disappearance of FL involving the BM.
