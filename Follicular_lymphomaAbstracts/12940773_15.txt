AIMS: To validate the applicability of tissue microarray (TM) in immunohistochemical profiling of B-cell lymphoma and to identify particular phenotypic profiles of B-cell neoplasms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-two diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBL), 54 follicular lymphomas (FL) and 74 mantle cell lymphomas (MCL) were arrayed. Immunohistochemical stains of TM were compared with immunostains of conventional, formalin-fixed and frozen material sections. Concordant staining results were obtained in more than 88% of cases for CD20, CD3, CD5, CD10, CD23, Bcl-2, IgD, secretory differentiation, p53 and p21 expression. Prognostically relevant hot-spot expression of Ki67 yielded concordant results in 71%. Applying TM for characterization of p27KIP1 expression, both typical and blastoid MCL only rarely showed p27KIP1 expression (9% and 15%), whereas 32% of nodal DLBL were p27KIP1-positive, irrespective of high proliferative activity. Among 22 B-cell lymphomas investigated genetically, a p53 + p21- immunophenotype in >20% of tumour cells correlated with p53 locus deletion. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphoma TM allows for immunohistochemical profiling of human B-cell lymphoma with a comparable accuracy to immunohistochemical studies performed on conventional tissue sections. Nodal DLBLs showed significantly more frequent expression of IgD and p27KIP1 than extranodal DLBL. MCL and DLBL frequently showed aberrant p27KIP1 expression. A p53 + p21- immunophenotype in >20% of tumour cells in B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma correlates with p53 gene deletion.
