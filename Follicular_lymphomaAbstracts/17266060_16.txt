Nongastric marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (NG-MZL) is a relatively uncommon indolent lymphoma. From 1990 to 2005, a total of 247 patients with histologically confirmed NG-MZL were analyzed. Ann Arbor stage I/II disease was present in 78% (167 out of 215). One hundred eighty-six patients out of two hundred eight were categorized into the low/low-intermediate risk group (89%) according to International Prognostic Index (IPI). Eighty percent (172/215) were in low risk group according to Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI). Complete and partial remissions (CR and PR) were achieved in 140 (92.7%) and 8 (5.3%) of the 151 stage I/II patients. Especially, radiation containing treatment achieved 96% CR rate (108 out of 113). In 38 patients with stage III/IV, CR and PR were achieved in 17 (44.7%) and 11 (26.3%), respectively. The estimated five-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 93.8% and 70.1%, respectively. Although anthracycline-containing regimen could achieve higher CR rate, it did not improve PFS. Stage III/IV, low hemoglobin, poor performance status, high/high-intermediate IPI, poor risk FLIPI, and nodal MZL were poor prognostic factors for PFS. NG-MZL is an indolent disease. FLIPI has strong power to predict the prognosis of NG-MZL.
