Malignant lymphomas arising in the uterus are uncommon and are more commonly seen in the cervix than the corpus. Involvement of the cervix as part of a systemic lymphoma is more common than primary lymphoma, but the cervix as the site of presentation is unusual. We report two cases of malignant lymphoma of the cervix. The first patient, a 52-year-old woman, was referred to colposcopy following persistent low grade dyskaryosis on cervical cytology. At colposcopy a Lletz biopsy was performed and a diagnosis of CIN 1 and focal CIN 2 was made. In addition the subepithelial zone revealed a non-Hodgkin's (NHL) B-cell follicular lymphoma. The patient was subsequently staged as NHL Stage 3E. The second patient, a 35-year-old woman, was referred to the gynaecology department with a history of abnormal vaginal bleeding and two abnormal smears. Subsequent cervical biopsy revealed a high grade, large cell, malignant lymphoma, diffuse, B-cell. The patient was staged as Stage IE. Primary lymphoma of the uterine cervix as illustrated in the second case is very unusual. One case had negative cytology and one case had abnormal cells of uncertain origin. This highlights the difficulty of diagnosing cervical lymphoma, a rare but treatable malignancy, on cytology and suggests that cervical biopsy is needed for the confirmation of the diagnosis.
