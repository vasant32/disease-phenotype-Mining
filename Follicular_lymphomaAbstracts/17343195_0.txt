 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between histopathological subtype of non-Hodgkin' s lymphoma(NHL) and chromosomal abnormalities, and compare the difference of chromosomal abnormalities between China and the West. METHODS: Routine G banding chromosome analysis and fluorescent in situ hybridization( FISH) were performed on lymph node specimens from 155 NHL patients. RESULTS: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma( DLBCL) constituted 38.1% of the cases followed by follicular lymphoma(FL) 17.4% , small lymphocytic lymphoma( SLL) 10.3% , peripheral T-cell lymphoma ( PTCL) ( unspecified) 8.4%, and angioimmunoblastic lymphoma 7.1%. One hundred nineteen patients (76. 8%) had clonal chromosomal abnormalities. The incidence of chromosomal abnormalities among FL, SLL, DLBCL, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and precursor T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (TLBL) was 96.3% , 87.5% , 86.4%, 83.3% and 83.3%, respectively. Complex karyotype was 86. 3% in DLBCL. The most frequent structural abnormalities in DLBCL involved chromosomes 3, 6, 14 and 1, with had high frequencies of 3q27 (41.2%) and 6q21, 6q23, 6q25 involvement (23.5%). But only 2 cases of DLBCL had classical t( 14; 18) (q32;q21) which was lower than that in the West (20%). The positive rate of IgH rearrangement was 40. 1% in DLBCL by FISH. No 13q14 deletion was found in 16 cases of SLL. Normal karyotype was observed in 8/11 cases with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma patients. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of the histopathological subtypes of NHL is different among different geographical areas. The chromosomal abnormalities in DLBCL was comparable between China and the West, but t( 14; 18) was infrequent in the former. The chromosomal abnormalities in SLL was different from the West. The incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma was lower than that in the West.
