A 48-year-old man suffered from intractable neck pain irradiating to his right arm. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine was unremarkable. A right-sided diagnostic C6-nerve root blockade was performed. Immediately following this seemingly uneventful procedure he developed a MRI-proven fatal cervical spinal cord infarction. We describe the blood supply of the cervical spinal cord and suggest that this infarction resulted from an impaired perfusion of the major feeding anterior radicular artery of the spinal cord, after local injection of iotrolan, bupivacaine, and triamcinolon-hexacetonide around the C6-nerve root on the right side.
