BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We present an unusual complication of epidural analgesia used to facilitate postoperative pain relief while allowing mobilization of the patient. CASE REPORT: A 65-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, chronic renal failure, and degenerative vertebral anatomy underwent resection of the left ureter due to obstructing tumor. The day following surgery, mobilization to an armchair was started, followed by a decrease in blood pressure. Soon after, flaccid paralysis with sparing of sensory functions, consistent with anterior spinal artery syndrome (ASAS), was diagnosed. CONCLUSIONS: This complication should be taken into account, especially in patients at risk, when considering epidural analgesia techniques in the postoperative period.
