We report a case of cervical anterior spinal artery syndrome (ASAS). MRI showed abnormal hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images from vertebrae C2 to T3. The lesion involved the anterior two-third bilaterally. Spinal angiography showed the superior segmental obstruction of the anterior spinal artery. Regarding nerve conduction studies, no CMAP (the compound muscle action potentials) could be obtained in either median nerves or ulnar nerves, and F-waves were absent. Six months after the onset, there was no any recovery of strength in both arms of the ASAS patient. In our opinion, CMAP could be seen a marker of prognosis for ASAS patients, and absent CMAP might forecast the bad prognosis.
