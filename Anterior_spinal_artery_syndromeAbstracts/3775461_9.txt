Spinal anesthesia has lost its popularity among physicians due to rare occurrences of paraplegia that have precipitated lawsuits, with staggering judgments in favor of claimants. Epidural block has now become a popular alternative because some believe it cannot cause paraplegia; however, paraplegia is as prevalent after induction of epidural anesthesia as after spinal anesthesia. Arachnoiditis has been incriminated as the causative agent when paraplegia has followed spinal anesthesia. Arachnoiditis is also a causative factor when paraplegia follows epidural block. Cord compression and anterior spinal artery syndrome have also been associated with paraplegia after epidural block though they have not been a problem with spinal block.
