We describe a 55-year-old man with quadriparesis and impaired pain and temperature sensation in whom T2-weighted MR images revealed a high-intensity lesion in the cord at C3-4. Angiography showed occlusion of the right vertebral artery and severe stenosis of the left vertebral artery. We concluded that the stenosis of the vertebral artery led to the anterior spinal artery syndrome and to a disturbance of consciousness.
