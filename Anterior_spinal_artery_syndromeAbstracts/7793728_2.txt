Spinal cord ischemia, as represented by acute paraplegia, is rare in the absence of trauma. It is even more uncommon that an infarction of the spinal cord occurs in a patient with no predisposition to vascular disease. We report a case of anterior spinal artery syndrome resulting from an infarction of the anterior aspect of the spinal cord in an otherwise healthy 45-year-old woman.
