Paraplegia is a rare but serious complication of spinal anaesthesia. We report an 83-year-old patient who developed anterior spinal artery syndrome resulting in paraplegia some 24 hours after undergoing spinal anaesthesia for a Moore's hemiarthroplasty. Return of neurologic function was documented prior to the onset of paralysis, with magnetic resonance imaging evidence suggestive of spinal cord infarction.
