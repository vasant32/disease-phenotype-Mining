Ten hours after onset of an anterior spinal artery syndrome (ASAS) F-waves could not be obtained from the paralysed left hand muscles. F-waves in the right hand were present and motor nerve conduction studies were normal on both sides. One week later paralysis of the right hand together with paraparesis occurred. Two days later F-waves from the right hand had disappeared. Three weeks later MRI confirmed the diagnosis of ischaemic spinal cord infarction.
