Although radical resection is the best treatment for local aggressive benign tumors or malignant tumors of the spine, total spondylectomy for lower thoracic vertebrae may cause anterior spinal artery syndrome. There are few reports in the literature in which this syndrome has been documented in association with thoracic spondylectomy, although this syndrome is the most common neurologic complication after abdominal aortic surgery. A 50-year-old woman with a giant cell tumor of the thoracic vertebrae was treated by posterior and anterior surgery. Thoracic segmental arteries from T10 to T12 had to be resected bilaterally to dissect the aorta free from the tumor. After resection of all feeding arteries to the tumor, the tumor and entire parts of T10, T11, and T12 were removed. Postoperative neurologic examination disclosed flaccid paralysis of the lower extremities and sphincter incontinence. Although pain and temperature sensation were absent, vibration and position sense were intact, showing anterior spinal artery syndrome. Intraoperative somatosensory-evoked potential monitoring only showed that transient deterioration failed to adequately reflect this neurologic injury. Major reconstructive surgery involving lower thoracic regions may cause anterior spinal artery syndrome. Somatosensory-evoked potential monitoring might not reliably predict overall neurologic outcome involving the blood supply of the lower thoracic regions.
