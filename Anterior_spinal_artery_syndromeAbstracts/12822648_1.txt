A 52-year-old male with a history of repair of aortic coarctation by prosthetic tube graft replacement 35-years ago developed anterior spinal artery syndrome caused by acute functional occlusion of the aorta at the repair site where pseudoaneurysm formation was observed. The patient was rescued by an emergency axillofemoral bypass, and residual hypertension in upper limbs was improved by elective ascending aorta-descending aorta bypass grafting.
