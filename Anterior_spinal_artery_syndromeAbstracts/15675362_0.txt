Anterior spinal artery syndrome is rare in children, especially in neonates. We present a girl with hydrops fetalis and hypothyroidism who developed flaccid paresis of both arms in the neonatal period (around day 25). MRI of the spine performed on day 52 revealed atrophic changes at C5-Th1 without Gd-DTPA-induced enhancement. Nerve conduction studies were also helpful in the diagnosis;in the upper limbs, motor potential was not elicited, while sensory nerve conduction velocity was normal. These clinical and laboratory findings suggested an atypical case of anterior spinal artery syndrome.
