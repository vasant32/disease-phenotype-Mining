The acute spinal cord infarction is a rare cause of acute-onset paraplegia. Furthermore, it is specially uncommon that the infarction occurs in patients with apparent low predisposition to vascular disease. The 20210A allele of the prothrombin gene (causing a threefold-increased risk in venous thromboembolism) was recently associated with unexplained spinal cord infarction in young women under treatment with estrogens (contraceptive pill). We report a case of anterior spinal artery syndrome resulting from an ischaemic infarction at the anterior aspect of the spinal cord in a healthy 50-year-old woman, carrying this mutation, being the first published case under treatment with transdermal estradiol. She referred the typical sudden-onset back pain associated to clinical anterior spinal artery syndrome with sphincter dysfunction and nontraumatic paraplegia. A possible multiple sclerosis was ruled out and the steroids or immunoglobulin therapy induced no clinical improvement. Cerebrospinal fluid and other investigations were all negative. Sequential MRI scans revealed development of spinal cord infarction from T10 to T11, with increased signal in T2-weighted image (T2). Because she referred a previous thrombophlebitis and suffered a deep-vein thrombosis one month after paraplegia, a complete coagulation study was performed. Antithrombin, proteins C and S, homocysteine, factor V Leiden, lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies were all normal or negatives. In opposite, the 20210A variation was positive (heterozygous) and the factor VIIIc level was very high (280 U/dl eight months later). We argue the relative importance of both findings. The patient had no a substantial recovery over a period of 20 months.Certainly, the prothrombin 20210A seems to be associated with unexplained ischemic myelopathy among the young women with estrogens.
