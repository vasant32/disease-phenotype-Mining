 PURPOSE: To outline the complications encountered after endoluminal treatment in patients with type B aortic dissection. METHODS: Between 1999 and 2001, 14 patients (12 men; mean age 60.3 years, range 39-79) with isolated type B aortic dissection (13 chronic, 1 acute) underwent aortic stent-grafting. Three patients with chronic dissection presented an acute clinical picture and were managed emergently. The left subclavian artery was intentionally covered by the prosthesis in 9 patients. Follow-up studies were performed at 6-month intervals. RESULTS: Stent-graft implantation was technically successful in all patients, but incomplete sealing (endoleak) of the entry site required additional proximal stent-graft implantation in 4. The left subclavian artery remained patent in 5 patients. Secondary conversion was required in 3 patients: 2 for acute type A dissection resulting from injury to the aortic arch by Talent endografts and a sustained hemorrhage (left hemothorax). In another patient, a secondary intramural hematoma subsided spontaneously. Anterior spinal artery syndrome in 1 patient persisted at 1 month. No bypass was necessary for the 9 patients with the covered left subclavian arteries. Mean follow-up was 14 months (range 1-23). CONCLUSIONS: Stent-grafting is feasible in patients with type B aortic dissection, although it is associated with a considerable rate of complications. Frank reporting of these sequelae for a variety of stent-grafts is of paramount importance to clarifying the limitations of the method.
