Anterior spinal artery syndrome (ASAS) is often a devastating spinal stroke occurring when the anterior spinal artery or one of its supplying anterior medullary arteries are occluded. The most common causes are arteriosclerosis, dissection of the abdominal aorta, cardiac embolism and degenerative spine disease, and the major risk factors are smoking, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia. The treatment has generally been supportive. We believe thrombolysis should be considered in the acute phase of this condition, and present a case with ASAS who experienced partial recovery after treatment given 4.5 h after symptom onset.
