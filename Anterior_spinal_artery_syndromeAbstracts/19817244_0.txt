Reported here is a 37-yr-old professional diving instructor who had developed complaints of back pain and weakness in the lower extremities after diving. He was eventually diagnosed as having spinal cord decompression sickness along with a likely diagnosis of anterior spinal artery (artery of Adamkiewicz) syndrome. Additionally, since the transthoracic echocardiography revealed patent foramen ovale, we hypothesized that it might have been a potential route for gas bubbles to occlude the anterior spinal artery in this diver.
