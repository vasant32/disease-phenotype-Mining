The syndrome of the anterior spinal artery is a rare disease with a diagnosis based an its characteristic clinical features. Until the widespread use of the Magnetic Resonance (MR) the lesional confirmation required an anatomopathological study. We report a 49-years-old male with lacinating interscapular pain and sudden asymmetrical tetraparesia, in whom MR scan disclosed a plurisegmental anterior spinal lesion and a posterolateral disk protrusion at C6-C7 level. We discuss the etiological and pathogenetical relation between degenerative vertebral disk disease and spinal infarctions.
