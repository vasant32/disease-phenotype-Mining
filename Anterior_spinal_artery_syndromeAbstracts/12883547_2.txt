 STUDY DESIGN: A case report of temporary anterior spinal artery syndrome secondary to peripheral angiography of the lower limbs. OBJECTIVES: To report a rare case of spinal cord ischemia following a straightforward peripheral angiography with femoral access. SETTING: Istanbul, Turkey. CASE REPORT: A 70-year-old patient with peripheral vascular disease developed temporary paraplegia after angiography caused by anterior spinal ischemia. His motor weakness improved gradually over a 2 month period. CONCLUSION: Spinal complications are extremely rare after peripheral angiography. The possible mechanisms of spinal cord damage are discussed, and the relevant data regarding the etiology are reviewed.
