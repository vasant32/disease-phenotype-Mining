A 70-year-old man had aortobifemoral bypass for severe aortoiliac occlusive disease. He developed spinal cord ischemia with anterior spinal artery syndrome. He had minimal recovery of muscle function, multiple postoperative complications, and 11 months postoperatively he died. Spinal cord ischemia is a rare and unpredictable complication of abdominal aortic surgery. It most often has occurred following surgery for aneurysm but can also occur after apparently routine surgery for occlusive disease.
