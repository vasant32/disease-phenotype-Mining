Three patients with symptoms due to the anterior spinal artery syndrome were treated by direct perfusion of dexamethasone sodium phosphate and urokinase into the artery of Adamkiewicz. Their symptoms were paraparesis with dissociated sensory loss and sphincter dysfunction, and there was no evidence of the possible cause. In the early phase of the disease, three consecutive injections were carried out with an interval of a week between each. All the patients made a good recovery.
