A patient sustained C7-C8 incomplete myelopathy with dissociated sensory loss after a whiplash injury. Cervical radiograms showed no fracture or dislocation but separation of the C4-C5 and C5-C6 spinous processes and anterior tilting on C5 on C6 vertebral body only in the head-neck flexed position. Complete sensory and motor recovery occurred after neck immobilization. The patient's transient neurologic deficits were probably caused by vascular insufficiency of an anterior radicular artery at the C5-C6 intervertebral foramen.
