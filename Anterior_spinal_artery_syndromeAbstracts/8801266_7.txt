Urodynamic studies and neurological examinations were performed on 128 patients with cervical myelopathies including 82 with spondylitic myelopathy and 46 with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), investigating the location of the paths subserving micturition in the spinal cord. Accurate history taking revealed micturitional symptoms in 95 patients, including irritative symptoms in 61 and obstructive symptoms in 71. Urinary incontinence was noted in 25 and residual urine of over 100 ml or retention was found in 22. Neurological examination revealed disturbed deep sensation in 55, disturbed superficial sensation in 63 and pyramidal signs (weakness, hyperreflexia of legs and Babinski sign) in 96 patients. Urodynamic studies revealed uninhibited contraction in 61 and detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia in 22 patients. Bladder capacity was smaller in patients with Babinski sign (P < 0.05) and in patients with uninhibited contraction (P < 0.001). Uninhibited contraction was more frequent in patients with all three of the above-mentioned pyramidal signs (P < 0.05). Detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia was more frequent in patients with disturbed deep sensation (P < 0.05) and pyramidal signs (P < 0.05, P < 0.0005). From above results and our previous findings in patients with anterior spinal artery syndrome and with tabes dorsalis, it is concluded that the pathway subserving detrusor function seems to be located mainly in the lateral column of the spinal cord. The descending pathway subserving coordination of bladder and urethral sphincter seems to be located mainly in the lateral column, and its ascending pathway seems to be located in the dorsal column. The path subserving urinary sensation seems to be located mainly in the dorsal column of the spinal cord.
