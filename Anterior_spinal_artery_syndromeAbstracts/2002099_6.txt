Magnetic resonance imaging was utilized to evaluate three women, one of whom was pregnant, with a clinical diagnosis of anterior spinal artery syndrome. In each case, development of spinal cord infarctions was spontaneous. Sagittal and axial MR images of the spine were obtained prior to and following administration of Gd-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid. Magnetic resonance showed no cord enlargement or signal abnormality on T1-weighted images prior to contrast medium administration. On T2-weighted images there was abnormal increase in signal intensity in the cord at levels corresponding to the neurologic deficits in all three patients. Variable contrast enhancement was demonstrated in these areas. Magnetic resonance imaging was positive, whereas CT-myelography, carried out in the two nonpregnant women, failed to demonstrate any abnormalities.
