Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS) is a rare genetic condition in which the main diagnostic criteria are terminal transverse limb defects and aplasia cutis congenita. Within the spectra of the clinical phenotype of AOS, anthropometric abnormalities have also been reported. We present growth pattern along with hormonal assays in three patients with AOS, one being treated with growth hormone (GH). In Patient 1 (a boy, age 1.9 years), with delayed psychomotor development, epilepsy, deficits of body mass and height, cryptorchidism, low insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) levels were found and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed hypoplasia of midline structures of the central nervous system (CNS). In Patient 2 (a girl, age 3.6 years) no significant abnormalities in development, body mass, height or neuroimaging were found. In Patient 3 (a girl, age 8.2 years), with delayed psychomotor development and short stature, low IGF-1 levels and partial GH deficiency were found; MRI revealed small pituitary and polymicrogyria. The girl started GH treatment, improving height velocity and gross coordination. Based on these observations, it seems that intensity of auxologic and hormonal deficits in children with AOS is associated with CNS lesions. Hence, there are indications for neuroimaging and interdisciplinary follow-up of psychomotor development, growth and puberty in this subset of patients with AOS.
