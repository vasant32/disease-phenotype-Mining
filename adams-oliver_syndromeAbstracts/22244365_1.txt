 AIMS: The aims were to investigate the prevalence of musculoskeletal pain in patients with type 2 diabetes and demonstrate possible associated factors. METHODS: Nine hundred fifty-one patients completed a validated questionnaire used in The Danish Health and Morbidity Survey and results were compared to data for 2923 matched subjects from the Danish population. Musculoskeletal pain was self-reported Pain in the shoulder and neck; Low-back pain; and Pain in the arm, hand, knee and/or hip. RESULTS: Compared to the age, gender and region matched controls patients reported musculoskeletal pain 1.7-2.1 times as frequent (p<0.001). Pain was more frequently reported in women (p<0.001). Low-back pain and Pain in the arm, hand, knee and/or hip was associated with body mass index (p<0.005). Low-back pain was associated with a sedentary life style, impaired quality of life and reduced physical function (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of musculoskeletal pain was seriously increased in patients with type 2 diabetes. It was associated with body mass index, reduced quality of life, low physical function and the ability to be physical active. Focus on musculoskeletal pain in clinical practice is therefore of major importance in lifestyle interventions in type 2 diabetes.
