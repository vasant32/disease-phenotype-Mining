Aplasia cutis congenita is a rare disorder characterized by developmental absence of skin on the scalp as multiple or solitary, noninflammatory, well demarcated, oval or circular 1- to 2-cm ulcers. The disease may be isolated or associated with anomalies of the skin, eyes, ear-nose-neck and limbs, developmental defects of the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary and central nervous systems, and malformation syndromes such as chromosomal abnormalities, Adams-Oliver syndrome, Bart's syndrome, and Johanson-Bilzzard syndrome. In this article, five newborn infants with aplasia cutis congenita (one associated with Adams-Oliver syndrome and another concomitant with Bart's syndrome) are reported because of their rare presentation in the literature.
