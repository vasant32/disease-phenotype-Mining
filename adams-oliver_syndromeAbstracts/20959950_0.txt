Cutis verticis gyrata (CVG) describes a rare thickening and folding of the scalp resembling the outer surface of the brain. Secondary CVG is caused by a variety of diseases such as nevi. A 38-year-old woman presented with a long history of a deformed right parietofrontal scalp. Clinical and histopathologic criteria lead to the diagnosis of CVG secondary to a combined blue and congenital nevus. Reports of malignant melanoma developing in this clinical setting mean that each patient must be followed closely or considered for prophylactic excision.
