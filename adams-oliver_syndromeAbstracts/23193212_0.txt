OBJECTIVE Oxidized lipoproteins and antioxidized LDL antibodies (antioxLDL abs) have been detected in human plasma and atherosclerotic lesions. The principle aim of this study was to analyze the possible relationship between IgG and IgM antioxLDL abs and factors involved in different metabolic pathways (inflammation, lipid metabolism, apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest profile) in the occluded popliteal artery (OPA) compared with the femoral vein (FV). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Fifteen patients with advanced atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes undergoing lower limb amputation participated in this study. Each patient had OPA and FV biopsy specimens and peripheral arterial occlusive disease. By real-time PCR, gene expression was analyzed from the OPA and FV specimens, and antioxLDL ab levels were measured by specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . RESULTS The OPA and FV showed a positive correlation between only IgM antioxLDL ab levels and the expression of genes involved in different metabolic pathways, including inflammation (TFPI), apoptosis (BAX, caspase 3, AKT1), plaque disruption (MMP2 and MMP10), lipid metabolism (SCARB1, PPARg), and cell turnover (CDKN1A), and genes for transcription and growth factors (NFkB and VEGFA, respectively). CONCLUSIONS The results show that gene expression in the metabolic pathways (apoptosis, lipid metabolism, and inflammation) in the OPA and FV are directly related to the levels of IgM antioxLDL abs.
