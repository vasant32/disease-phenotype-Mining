 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the management of congenital scalp defects in infants. METHODS: From 1996 to 2008, 6 infants with congenital scalp defects were treated with dressing change, flap transposition, or tissue expansion combined with skull defect reconstruction. RESULTS: Parietal scalp defects in 6 cases were healed after treatment. 5 cases were followed up for 3 months to one year. 2 cases had scalp alopecia in some areas. The scar was inconspicuous in the other 3 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Dressing change is suitable for small scalp defect, while flap transposition should be used for medium defect. For large full-thickness cranial defect, dressing change and tissue expansion should be performed at the first stage, followed by skull defect reconstruction and expanded flap transposition.
