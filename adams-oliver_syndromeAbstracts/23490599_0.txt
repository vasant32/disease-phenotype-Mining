Incretin based therapies are known to have pleotropic benefits in type 2 diabetes but have not been studied in new onset type 1 diabetes. In this randomized, open label study, we investigated the effect of the addition of exenatide or sitagliptin to insulin in patients with new onset type 1 diabetes. Our data suggest that the addition of exenatide and sitagliptin decreases insulin requirements without increasing endogenous insulin production and hypoglycemic events.
