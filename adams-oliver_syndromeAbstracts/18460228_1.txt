 OBJECTIVES: We report the multicentric French experience with transcatheter closure in children weighing 15 kilograms or less, with the aim of assessing the efficacy of the procedure in this age group. PATIENTS: We included all children weighing 15 kilograms or less, and seen between January, 1997, and June, 2004, who had successful transcatheter closure of an interatrial communication within the oval fossa. RESULTS: Transcatheter closure was performed in 35 patients weighing 15 kilograms or less, of whom 14 were male and 21 female. The procedures were undertaken in 8 different centres, the patients having a median age of 3 years, with a range from zero to 6.2 years, and a mean weight of 13 kilograms, with a range from 3.6 to 15 kilograms. All the patients were symptomatic, with associated cardiac malformations present in 4 cases, and extracardiac anomalies in 4 patients, including Down's syndrome in 3, and Adams Oliver syndrome in the other case. In 1 patient, emergency cardiac surgery was needed 24 h after the procedure to correct a previously undiagnosed divided right atrium. No other complication occurred. After a median follow-up of 2 years, with a range from 0.5 to 5.2 years, all the patients are asymptomatic, except for one long-standing patient with bronchodysplasia. In 1 other patient, a small residual bidirectional shunt was detected by echocardiography. No patient presented significant arrhythmia. In the patients followed-up for more than 12 months, we found a significant gain in weight gain. CONCLUSION: Transcatheter closure of an interatrial communication within the oval fossa is efficient in children weighing 15 kilograms or less, and can be proposed as a first line of treatment in symptomatic patients. Children with retarded growth tend to have complete recovery within one year of closure.
