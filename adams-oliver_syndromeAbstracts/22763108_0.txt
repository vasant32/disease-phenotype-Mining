 AIMS: Our main aim was to analyse gender differences in the association of adherence and poor glycaemic control (PGC) in a cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Germany. METHODS: Baseline data of the DIANA-study, a prospective cohort study of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in South-West Germany, were analysed. Information on medication adherence and factors related to PGC was obtained by self-administered questionnaire. PGC was defined as HbA(1c)â‰¥7.5%. Bivariate and multivariate analyses using log-binomial regression were employed to assess overall and gender-specific associations of non-adherence and PGC. RESULTS: 624 men and 518 women were included in the analyses. In total, 147 men (24%) and 114 women (23%) reported non-adherence to medication. In men, PGC was found in 37% of the participants reporting non-adherence and in 19% reporting adherence (adjusted prevalence ratio (PR)=1.90, 95%-CI: 1.46-2.49). In women, PGC was found in 19% of the participants reporting non-adherence and in 18% reporting adherence (adjusted PR=0.97, 95%-CI: 0.65-1.46). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show gender-specific differences in the association of adherence and PGC. This underlines the need for efforts to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with a particular focus on men.
