 In rare cases (1-8%) diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) suffer from diabetic nephropathy (dNP) due to pancreatic diabetes mellitus (PDM). Aim of this study was to investigate differences in the outcome of patients with PDM and those with type 2 diabetes.In a retrospective study we evaluated 96 diabetic patients, who started hemodialysis (HD) in our dialysis centre (1997-2005). In 12 patients PMD was diagnosed, and 84 patients had type 2 diabetes. In both groups we compared vascular risk factors and prevalence of vascular diseases at the start of dialysis. We also evaluated incidence of malnutrition, and 5-year survival in both patient groups.The vascular risk factors were similar in both patient groups, also the prevalence of vascular diseases at the initiation of HD was similar in both groups. In the patients with PDM the mean BMI (kg/m2) was lower (22 + 3 versus 25 + 3), and also their serum albumin was lower (2.7 + 0.3 versus 3.4 + 0.3 g/dl, p < 0.05). Four of these patients (33%) developed malnutrition (BMI < 18.5). In the patients with PDM the age adjusted 5-year survival was significantly lower (8% versus 27%, p < 0.05) than in the type 2 diabetic patients.Conclusions in HD-treated patients with type 2 diabetes or PDM the prevalence of vascular diseases was not significantly different. The lower survival of PDM patients can be related to poor nutrition status.
