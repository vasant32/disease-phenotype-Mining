Prediabetes (IPD; n=122) and normoglycemic individuals (n=100) underwent assessment of polymorphisms of TNFα (-238, -308) and IL6 (-174). After 27.25±5.64 months, 16 IPD had reverted to normoglycemia and 18 progressed to diabetes. TNFα -238AA/GA genotypes were significantly more common in IPD, had higher TNFα, higher progression to diabetes and lower reversal.
