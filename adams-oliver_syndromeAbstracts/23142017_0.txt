We measured circulating C1q-binding adiponectin (C1q-APN) levels before and after 3-month treatment with pioglitazone in people with type 2 diabetes. The results indicate 3-month treatment with pioglitazone reduces circulating levels of C1q-APN/total-adiponectin ratio without changes in body mass index.
