AIMS: To determine whether baseline characteristics, especially HbA1c, predict the likelihood of reaching HbA1c ≤7.0% or the risk of experiencing hypoglycemia after the addition of insulin glargine to oral therapy in type 2 diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pooled patient-level data from 12 prospective, randomized, controlled studies that used insulin glargine in a treat-to-target titration regimen seeking fasting glucose levels ≤5.5 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) were analyzed. Baseline characteristics were evaluated by logistic regression models as predictors of reaching a target HbA1c ≤7.0% or experiencing confirmed hypoglycemia. The effect of prior glycemic control was further explored by analysis of categorical ranges of baseline HbA1c. RESULTS: Of 2312 participants, 95% completed 24 weeks of treatment. Lower HbA1c at baseline was independently associated with reaching HbA1c target (adjusted OR for 1% difference: 0.538, p < 0.0001) and also with likelihood of experiencing confirmed hypoglycemic events (adjusted OR: 0.835, p <0.0001) at week 24. In an unadjusted analysis by baseline HbA1c range, the strong association between baseline control and attaining target HbA1c was confirmed (75% with baseline HbA1c <8.0%, 60% with baseline HbA1c ≥8.0% and <9.0%, and 38% with baseline HbA1c ≥9.0% attained HbA1c ≤7.0%). The incidence of hypoglycemia confirmed <3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) was higher in the lower baseline HbA1c ranges but severe hypoglycemia was infrequent at all baseline HbA1c levels. CONCLUSIONS: Systematically titrated insulin glargine, added to oral agents, was effective over a wide range of baseline HbA1c. Lower baseline HbA1c was the best clinical predictor of achieving HbA1c ≤7.0% and also associated with higher risk of glucose-confirmed hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia was infrequent using this treatment approach.
