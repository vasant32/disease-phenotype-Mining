In this report we describe a male patient with the interesting combination of a large congenital scalp defect, distal limb reduction anomalies, right spastic hemiplegia and hypoplasia of the left arteria cerebri media. Follow-up data from birth up to the age of 18 years revealed positive evolution with low to normal intelligence. The findings in the present patient, i.e. an Adams-Oliver syndrome associated with a severe neurological deficit, are best explained as resulting from interruption of the early embryonic blood supply.
