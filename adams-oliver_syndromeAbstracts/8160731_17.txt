We describe a mother and her 3 children with variable scalp defects and limb defects consistent with a diagnosis of Adams Oliver syndrome also presenting with additional anomalies including congenital heart disease, microcephaly, epilepsy, mental retardation, arrhinencephaly, hydrocephaly, anatomic bronchial anomalies, and renal anomalies. The clinical variation between the individuals is more pronounced than in previously reported families.
