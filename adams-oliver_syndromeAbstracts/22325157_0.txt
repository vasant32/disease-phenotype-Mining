 BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In this study, broccoli sprout powder (BSP), a good source of bioactive components, was used as supplementary treatment in type 2 diabetic patients. METHODS: This randomized clinical trial included 81 patients with type 2 diabetes. Participants were randomly assigned to consume 10g/d BSP (group A), 5g/d BSP (group B), or the placebo (group C), each for 4 weeks. Fasting blood glucose (FBS), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride concentration (TG), LDL-C, HDL-C, and oxidized-LDL were measured at baseline and 4 weeks after treatment. The ratios of OX-LDL/LDL, atherogenic index of plasma (AIP; log TG/HDL), TC/HDL and LDL/HDL were calculated as cardiovascular risk factors parameters, at baseline and 4 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients completed the study; n=23, 26 and 23 for groups A, B and C, respectively. After 4 weeks, BSP in dose of 10g/d, significantly decreased serum triglycerides, OX-LDL/LDL ratio and AIP (p<0.05 for treatment effect). HDL-C concentration was significantly higher (p<0.01 for treatment) in group A as compared with group B and placebo. CONCLUSIONS: BSP as supplementary treatment in type 2 diabetes could have favorable effects on lipid profiles and OX-LDL/LDL ratio, as risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
