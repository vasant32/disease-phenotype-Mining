 AIMS: This study was carried out with the purpose of investigating the association between serum lactadherin, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: A total of 105 subjects including 27 T2DM patients without vascular complications (DM), 28 T2DM patients with vascular complications (DC), 25 elderly healthy volunteers (older) and 25 younger healthy volunteers (younger) were recruited into the study. Carotid-femoral PWV was measured using an automatic device. Serum lactadherin, MCP-1 and TNFα were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: PWV and lactadherin, MCP-1 and TNFα were significantly higher in DM and DC groups than those of older and younger groups. PWV and lactadherin were higher in older group than those of younger group. Moreover, lactadherin was significantly correlated with MCP-1, TNFα, PWV, HbA1c and 2 h postprandial blood glucose (P2hBG) (P<0.05). In multivariate regression analysis, the independent determinants of lactadherin were HbA1c, P2hBG and age (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore that lactadherin is correlated with poor blood glucose control and diabetic vascular complications.
