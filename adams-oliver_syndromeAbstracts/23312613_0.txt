We examined the effects of atorvastatin on urinary podocyte excretion. Thirteen patients with type 2 diabetes receiving 2.5mg of rosuvastatin were recruited and the medication was switched to 10mg of atorvastatin for a 24-week period. With the switch to atorvastatin, the urinary excretion of podocytes was significantly reduced.
