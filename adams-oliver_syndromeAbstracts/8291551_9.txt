We report on a patient with Adams-Oliver syndrome and report new findings: a chylous pleural effusion and juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia. Also, our patient had congenital heart disease, confirming that heart lesions are a manifestation in this syndrome. The major manifestations of this disorder are summarized. Included are cases not previously recognized as having Adams-Oliver syndrome identified in a literature survey. Distal limb deficiency is commonest with more frequent and more severe involvement of the lower limbs. Scalp defects are the second commonest manifestation, while an underlying skull defect is not infrequent. Cutis marmorata telangiectatica and dilated scalp veins are significant signs of this condition. This review highlights unresolved questions about Adams-Oliver syndrome.
