 BACKGROUND: There are an increasing number of patients suffering from fatty liver caused by type 2 diabetes. We intended to study the preventive and therapeutic effect of L-carnitine (LC) on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 2 diabetic mice and to explore its possible mechanism. METHODS: Thirty male Kungming mice were randomly divided into five groups: control group, diabetic group, pre-treatment group (125 mg/kg BW), low-dose (125 mg/kg BW) therapeutic group and high-dose (250 mg/kg BW) therapeutic group. The morphology of hepatocytes was observed by light and electron microscopy. LC and ALC (acetyl L-carnitine) concentrations in the liver were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Moreover, liver weight, insulin levels and free fatty acid (FFA) and triglyceride (TG) levels in the liver and plasma were measured. RESULTS: Average liver LC and ALC levels were 33.7% and 20% lower, respectively, in diabetic mice compared to control mice (P < 0.05). After preventive and therapeutic treatment with LC, less hepatocyte steatosis, clearer crista and fewer glycogen granules in the mitochondria were observed. Decreased liver weight, TG levels, and FFA concentrations (P < 0.05) in the liver were also observed after treatment with LC in diabetic mice. Moreover, liver LC and ALC levels increased upon treatment with LC, whereas the ratio of LC and ALC decreased significantly (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: LC supplements ameliorated fatty liver in type 2 diabetic mice by increasing fatty acid oxidation and decreasing the LC/ALC ratio in the liver. Therefore, oral administration of LC protected mitochondrial function in liver.
