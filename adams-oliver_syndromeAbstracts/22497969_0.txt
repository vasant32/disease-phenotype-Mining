We investigated a possible association between serum plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels and renal dysfunction in 124 type 2 diabetes patients. Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that the PAI-1 levels were significantly inversely correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) independent of albuminuria, BMI, LDL-C, and triglyceride.
