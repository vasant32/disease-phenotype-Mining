Aplasia cutis congenita (ACC) may occur in isolation or with other congenital malformations. Peripheral limb anomalies and ACC are major elements of the Adams-Oliver syndrome, which is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder. We report on a sister and brother with ACC and brain, eyes, and transverse limb anomalies. The phalanges of the hands and feet were either short or absent. The girl also had absence of right patella, was severely mentally retarded and blind with retinal nonattachment. The boy had a falciform fold in the left eye. He died at age one week and autopsy showed partial agenesis of corpus callosum. The findings in the sibs may represent a severe variant of the Adams-Oliver syndrome, or a previously unrecognized syndrome involving vascular disruption.
