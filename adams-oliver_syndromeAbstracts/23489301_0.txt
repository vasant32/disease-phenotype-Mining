Pharmacotherapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes has not been shown to reduce major cardiovascular (CV) events. Conversely, there have been concerns that some classes or agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes may increase CV risk. We sought to determine whether the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor alogliptin affects CV risk by evaluating the incidence of CV events in patients treated with alogliptin, placebo or comparator anti-hyperglycemic drugs in the clinical trial database for alogliptin using the composite major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) end points of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke. The pooled analysis included 4,168 patients exposed to alogliptin 12.5 and 25 mg daily for 2023 patient-years compared to 691 patients treated with placebo for 263 patient-years and 1,169 patients treated with other anti-diabetic agents (metformin, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones) for 703 patient-years. Cardiovascular events were adjudicated by an expert endpoint committee blinded to treatment allocation. The incidence rates of the combined MACE were not significantly different between patients treated with alogliptin and comparator therapies (hazard ratio = 0.635, 95% CI, 0.0, 1.41). Additionally, other types of serious CV events were not significantly different between patients treated with alogliptin and comparator therapies. In conclusion, these analyses have not demonstrated a signal of increased CV risk with alogliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes. Future results from the adequately powered EXAMINE trial will definitively assess the CV safety profile of aloglipin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
