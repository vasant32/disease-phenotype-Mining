OBJECTIVEWe investigated whether glycation gap (G-Gap), an index of intracellular glycation of proteins, was associated with diabetes complications.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSWe measured concomitantly HbA(1c) and fructosamine in 925 patients with type 2 diabetes to calculate the G-Gap, defined as the difference between measured HbA(1c), and fructosamine-based predicted HbA(1c). Patients were explored for retinopathy, nephropathy, peripheral neuropathy, cardiac autonomic neuropathy (n = 512), and silent myocardial ischemia (n = 506).RESULTSMacroproteinuria was the only complication that was associated with G-Gap (prevalence in the first, second, and third tertile of G-Gap: 2.9, 6.2, and 11.0%, respectively; P < 0.001). The G-Gap was higher in patients with macroproteinuria than in those without (1.06 ± 1.62 vs. 0.03 ± 1.30%; P < 0.0001). Because HbA(1c) was associated with both G-Gap (HbA(1c) 7.0 ± 1.4, 7.9 ± 1.4, and 10.1 ± 1.8% in the first, second, and third G-Gap tertile, respectively; P < 0.0001) and macroproteinuria (HbA(1c) 8.8 ± 2.2% if macroproteinuria, 8.3 ± 2.0% if none; P < 0.05), and because it could have been a confounder, we matched 54 patients with macroproteinuria and 200 patients without for HbA(1c). Because macroproteinuria was associated with lower serum albumin and fructosamine levels, which might account for higher G-Gap, we calculated in this subpopulation albumin-indexed fructosamine and G-Gap; macroproteinuria was independently associated with male gender (odds ratio [OR], 3.2; 95% CI, 1.5-6.7; P < 0.01), hypertension (2.9; [1.1-7.5]; P < 0.05), and the third tertile of albumin-indexed G-Gap (2.3; [1.1-4.4]; P < 0.05) in multivariate analysis.CONCLUSIONIn type 2 diabetic patients, G-Gap was associated with macroproteinuria, independently of HbA(1c), albumin levels, and confounding factors, suggesting a specific role of intracellular glycation susceptibility on kidney glomerular changes.
