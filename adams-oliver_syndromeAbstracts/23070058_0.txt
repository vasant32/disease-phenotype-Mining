 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Downregulation of levels of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) during in-vitro short-term exposure to high glucose concentrations relates to reduced activity of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) and increased synthesis of platelet-activating factor (PAF). We investigated the possible relationship between PAF and SIRT1 pathways in EPCs during altered glucose homeostasis. METHODS: SIRT1 and PAF receptor (PAF-R) levels were determined by western blot, RT-PCR and confocal laser-scanning microscopy. In-vivo experiments were performed on 48 type 2 diabetic patients (25 with poor glycaemic control and 23 with good glycaemic control) and 20 control individuals. In-vitro experiments with the PAF-R antagonist CV3988 were performed on EPCs isolated from leucocyte-rich buffy coat of healthy human donors. RESULTS: Decreased SIRT1 protein levels were observed in EPCs from type 2 diabetic patients compared with control individuals (p < 0.01). Notably, the SIRT1 level was consistently lower in patients with poor glycaemic control than in those with good glycaemic control (p < 0.01). Diabetic patients also showed an upregulation of PAF-Rs; this response occurred to a greater extent in individuals with poor glycaemic control than in those with good glycaemic control. In-vitro experiments confirmed that EPCs respond to PAF stimulation with decreased SIRT1 protein and SIRT1 mRNA levels. Moreover, reduction of SIRT1 levels and activity were abolished by CV3988. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These findings unveil a link between PAF and SIRT1 pathways in EPCs that contributes to the deleterious effect of hyperglycaemia on the functional properties of EPCs, crucial in diabetes and peripheral vascular complications.
