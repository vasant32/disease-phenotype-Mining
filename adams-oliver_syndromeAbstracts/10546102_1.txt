We report on a girl with congenital scalp and acral reduction limb defects, consistent with the diagnosis of Adams-Oliver syndrome. The presence of constriction rings makes the limb anomalies in this case similar to those seen in the amniotic band disruption sequence. Vascular disruption--with or without secondary amniotic rupture--may be responsible for the observed anomalies. Therefore we believe that the present observation adds further evidence for the hypothesis that the Adams-Oliver syndrome is a vascular disruption sequence.
