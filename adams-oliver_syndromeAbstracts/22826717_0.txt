 BACKGROUND: Aplasia cutis congenita (ACC) is a congenital absence of skin, and a single alopecic lesion on the scalp is the most common form. MAIN OBSERVATION: We present a case of ACC with tetralogy of Fallot-A. Differetial diagnosis included Adams-Oliver syndrome and nevus psiloliparus. Interestingly, our patient showed multiple ACC lesions, which were located along Blaschko's lines. CONCLUSIONS: As far as we know, our case is the third case of ACC with tetralogy of Fallot-A. Also, this is the first case of ACC associated with Blaschko's lines.
