AIM: Bariatric surgery is associated with a significant improvement in glucose control and even diabetes remission. There are no studies investigating national trends in the use of bariatric surgery in people with type 2 diabetes. We examine trends in the use of bariatric surgery in patients with and without type 2 diabetes between 2001 and 2010 in Spain. METHODS: We identified patients who underwent bariatric surgery using national hospital discharge data. Discharges were grouped by diabetes status. Incidence of discharges due to bariatric surgery were calculated and stratified by diabetes status, procedure and year. We calculated length of stay (LOS) and in-hospital mortality (IHM). RESULTS: From 2001 to 2010 13,038 bariatric surgery procedures were performed. Over the study period 23.6% (n=3080) of all patients undergoing bariatric procedure had DM as a co-diagnosis. This prevalence increased from 17.3% in 2001 to 25.5% in 2010. LOS and IHM were similar among patients with and without type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSION: The proportion of subjects with type 2 diabetes among bariatric surgery patient has increased over time, in part due to an increase in the use of laparoscopic techniques.
