Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) are used for treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Little is known about their cardiovascular (CV) impact. We sought to determine the effects of chronic treatment on vascular function in T2DM. Brachial artery endothelial-dependent flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and endothelial-independent glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) function and carotid intima-medial thickness (cIMT) were assessed in 11 severely obese T2DMs (4 females, 7 males: 55 ± 8 years, diabetes duration 8.3 ± 4.7 years mean ± s.d.) before and after 6 months GLP-1 RA. Body weight (5.3 ± 1.2 kg; p < 0.05) and magnetic resonance imaging determined total and subcutaneous fat, but not visceral fat, decreased. Glycaemic control improved. There were no significant changes in FMD, GTN and cIMT (-1.1 ± 0.4%, 0.3 ± 3.0% and 0.00 ± 0.04 mm, respectively). Despite significant improvements in body composition and glycaemic control, 6 months GLP-1 RA treatment did not modulate vascular function. Alternative strategies may therefore be needed to reduce the burden of CV risk in severely obese patients with long-standing T2DM.
