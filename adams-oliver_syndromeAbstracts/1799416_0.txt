A 29-year-old woman consulted together with her husband for a problem of congenital joint contractures. Clinical findings in the woman were characteristic of "amyoplasia congenita". In view of the severe distal limb involvement, the possibility of a distal arthrogryposis was also considered. Unexpectedly, the husband presented terminal transverse defects, mainly of the feet, suggestive of Adams-Oliver syndrome, an autosomal dominant condition with variable expression. This discovery significantly altered the counseling given to the couple, i.e. they had to be given a high recurrence risk for congenital limb malformations in their offspring and rigorous echographic monitoring of future pregnancies was advised.
