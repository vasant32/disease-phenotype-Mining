A study by Chan et al in this issue of Diabetologia (DOI: 10.1007/s00125-012-2818-4 ) reports that low plasma bilirubin levels are associated with an increased risk of amputation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participating in the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study. These findings raise the interesting and clinically relevant hypothesis that bilirubin protects against risk of amputation in patients with type 2 diabetes. This commentary considers some of the limitations associated with research aiming to define any link between circulating bilirubin levels and vascular disease. Numerous confounding factors (several of which may be present in patients with type 2 diabetes) may explain why the literature regarding this potentially protective role of bilirubin remains controversial.
