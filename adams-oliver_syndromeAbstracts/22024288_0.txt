 AIM: To investigate circulating visfatin and vaspin levels in first-degree relatives of subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (FDRs) who frequently have higher value of HOMA-IR and beta cell dysfunction. METHODS: Serum visfatin and vaspin concentrations were measured in 179 Iranian subjects (90 normoglycemic FDRs and 89 age- and sex-matched healthy controls) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods. RESULT: Serum visfatin levels were significantly lower in the FDRs when compared to the controls (1.71±0.93 ng/ml versus 2.69±2.02 ng/ml, p=0.0001). However, no significant difference was found in serum vaspin concentrations between the FDRs and the controls (0.452±0.254 ng/ml versus 0.409±0.275 ng/ml, p>0.05). In multiple logistic regression analysis, the FDRs showed a significant association with lower visfatin levels after adjustments for age, sex, Body Mass Index, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, lipid profile, blood glucose levels and HOMA-IR [odds ratios (OR)=1.71, 95% confidence interval (1.30-2.25); p<0.0001]. CONCLUSION: The FDRs showed a significant association with lower visfatin levels. The observed lower circulating visfatin levels in FDRs may suggest a pathophysiological role for visfatin in beta cell dysfunction in this group.
