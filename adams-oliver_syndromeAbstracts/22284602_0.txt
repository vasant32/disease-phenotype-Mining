The multiple physiological characterizations of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) make it a promising drug candidate for the therapy of type 2 diabetes. However, the biological half-life of GLP-1 is short in vivo due to degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) and renal clearance. The stabilization of GLP-1 is critical for its utility in drug development. In this study, several GLP-1 mutants containing an N-terminal cyclic conformation were prepared in that the existence of cyclic conformation is predicted to increase the stabilization of GLP-1 in vivo. In this study, the binding capacities of the mutants were determined, the stabilities of the mutants were investigated and the physiological functions of the mutants were compared with those of wild-type GLP-1 in animals. The results indicated that the mutant (GLP1N8) remarkably raised the half-life in vivo; it also showed better glucose tolerance and higher HbA(1c) reduction than GLP-1 and exendin-4 in rodents. These results suggest that the GLP-1 analog (GLP1N8) which contains an N-terminal cyclic structure might be utilized as possible potent anti-diabetic drugs in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
