During weight loss, erythrocyte thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) decreased (221±52 to 195±39 nmol/L, P<0.05) on a diet with adequate thiamine (1.1 mg/day) but was unchanged (217±55 vs 218±52 nmol/L, NS) on a high thiamine diet (2.8 mg/day). Attention to thiamine status may be required in patients with diabetes after weight loss.
