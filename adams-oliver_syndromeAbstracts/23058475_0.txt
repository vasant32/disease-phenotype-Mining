 AIMS: To identify healthcare, self-care, and health status disparities between immigrants and non-immigrants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Canada. METHODS: Immigrants and non-immigrants with T2DM were compared in the nationally representative 2005 and 2007 Canadian Community Health Surveys (N = 7658 representing 1,205,000 in 2005; N = 3605 representing 1,446,000 in 2007). RESULTS: No significant differences existed between immigrants and non-immigrants with T2DM in annual glycated hemoglobin testing, foot examination by a physician, urine protein testing, or eye examinations. Among self-care measures, immigrants were less likely to perform foot self-examination at least weekly (OR = 0.70 [0.50, 0.98] in 2005; OR = 0.65 [0.47, 0.91] in 2007) or smoke (OR = 0.63 [0.45, 0.87] in 2005; OR = 0.44 [0.25, 0.77] in 2007), but there were no differences in self-monitoring of blood glucose or physical inactivity. With respect to health status, immigrants were less likely to have a chronic condition in addition to T2DM (OR = 0.68 [0.54, 0.86] in 2005; OR = 0.59 [0.41, 0.84] in 2007), but there were no differences in self-perceived general or mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare, self-care, and health status were similar in immigrants and non-immigrants with T2DM in Canada; however, immigrants were less likely to regularly examine their feet. Culturally appropriate footcare education should be considered to prevent lower limb complications.
