Adams-Oliver syndrome is a rare congenital anomaly complex characterized by aplasia cutis congenita (ACC) and terminal transverse limb defects. We present a 9-year-old girl with a large, congenital scalp defect on her vertex, without underlying bone defect. Brachydactyly and syndactylia of her toes were also evident. Her 13-year-older brother had an 8 x 5 cm scalp defect without any limb defects (isolated ACC).
