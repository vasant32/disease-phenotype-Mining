 OBJECTIVE: To compare magnetic resonance imaging-derived right ventricular (RV) dimensions and function between men with type 2 diabetes and healthy subjects, and to relate these parameters to left ventricular (LV) dimensions and function. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: RV and LV volumes and functions were assessed in 78 men with uncomplicated type 2 diabetes and 28 healthy men within the same range of age using magnetic resonance imaging. Steady-state free precession sequences were used to assess ventricular dimensions. Flow velocity mapping across the pulmonary valve and tricuspid valve was used to assess RV outflow and diastolic filling patterns, respectively. Univariate general linear models were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: RV end-diastolic volume was significantly decreased in patients compared with healthy subjects after adjustment for BMI and pulse pressure (177 ± 28 mL vs. 197 ± 47 mL, P < 0.01). RV systolic function was impaired: peak ejection rate across the pulmonary valve was decreased (433 ± 54 mL/s vs. 463 ± 71 mL/s, P < 0.01) and pulmonary flow acceleration time was longer (124 ± 17 ms vs. 115 ± 25 ms, P < 0.05). Indexes of RV diastolic function were impaired: peak filling rate and peak deceleration gradient of the early filling phase were 315 ± 63 mL/s vs. 356 ± 90 mL/s (P < 0.01) and 2.3 ± 0.8 mL/s(2) × 10(-3) vs. 2.8 ± 0.8 mL/s(2) × 10(-3) (P < 0.01), respectively. All RV parameters were strongly associated with its corresponding LV parameter (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic cardiomyopathy affects the right ventricle, as demonstrated by RV remodeling and impaired systolic and diastolic functions in men with type 2 diabetes, in a similar manner as changes in LV dimensions and functions. These observations suggest that RV impairment might be a component of the diabetic cardiomyopathy phenotype.
