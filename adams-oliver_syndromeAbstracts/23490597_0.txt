Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of end stage renal disease and dialysis worldwide. Despite aggressive treatment, the number of patients on hemodialysis due to type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasing annually. The lack of reliable animal models that mimic human disease has delayed the identification of specific factors that cause or predict DN. Different investigators around the world are testing different murine models. Validation criteria for early and advanced DN, phenotypic methods, background strain have recently been developed. Establishment of an authentic mouse model of DN will undoubtedly facilitate the understanding of the underlying genetic mechanisms that contribute to the development of DN and to study new treatments. Here we describe the characteristics of our new mouse model with type 1 diabetes mellitus and different haptoglobin genotypes that can mimic human DN.
