The authors report a case of Adams-Oliver syndrome in an 11Â months child. This child was referred to our unit at the age of six months with right hand brachydactyly and alopecia on the vertex. We decided not to treat hand malformations, given the lack of functional impact. Alopecia of the vertex was corrected by tissue expansion of the scalp, with a satisfactory cosmetic result at five months.
