AIMS: To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of linagliptin as add-on therapy to one approved oral antidiabetes drug (OAD) in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and insufficient glycaemic control. METHODS: This 52-week, multicentre, open-label, parallel-group study evaluated once-daily linagliptin 5 mg, as add-on therapy to one OAD (biguanide, glinide, glitazone, sulphonylurea [SU] or Î±-glucosidase inhibitors [A-GI]) in 618 patients. After a 2-week run-in, patients on SU or A-GI were randomised to either linagliptin (once daily, 5 mg) or metformin (two- or three-times daily, up to 2250 mg/day) as add-on therapy. Patients receiving the other OADs received linagliptin add-on therapy (non-randomised). RESULTS: Adverse events were mostly mild or moderate, and rates were similar across all groups. Hypoglycaemic events were rare, except in the SU group. Overall, 26 (5.8%) hypoglycaemic events were reported in patients receiving linagliptin (non-randomised). Hypoglycaemic events were similar for linagliptin and metformin added to A-GI (1/61 versus 2/61, respectively) or SU (17/124 versus 10/63). Significant reductions in HbA1c levels (between -0.66% and -0.92%) occurred throughout the study period for the background therapy groups that received linagliptin (baseline HbA1c 7.86% to 8.12%). The decline in HbA1c levels was indistinguishable between linagliptin and metformin groups when administered as add-on therapy to A-GI or SU. CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily linagliptin demonstrated safety and tolerability over 1 year and provided effective add-on therapy leading to significant HbA1c reductions, similar to metformin, over 52 weeks in Japanese patients.
