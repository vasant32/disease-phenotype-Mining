Adams-Oliver syndrome is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by aplasia cutis congenita (ACC) and variable degrees of terminal transverse limb defects. We report on a neonatal case with the sporadic form of the disease with minimal expression, illustrating the wide spectrum of clinical expression in Adams-Oliver syndrome. We also review the literature and highlight the different pathogenetic hypotheses of this syndrome.
