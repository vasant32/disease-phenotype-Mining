CONTEXT: To examine whether widespread tissue expression of the glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 receptor supports the possibility of differential effects of GLP-1-based therapeutics on cardiac function, blood pressure, food intake, gastric emptying, and other regulatory activities. GLP-1 receptor agonists (RAs) have demonstrated pleiotropic effects on overweight/obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular (CV) disease. Food-regulatory effects have been demonstrated in preclinical and clinical trials, including reduced gastric motility and food intake leading to body weight reductions. Native GLP-1 and GLP-1 RAs have demonstrated cardioprotective effects in preclinical models. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Using PubMed, we performed a search of the recent literature on GLP-1 and GLP-1 RAs. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Preliminary clinical data indicate native GLP-1 has beneficial effects on endothelial cell function and vascular inflammation. Native GLP-1 and GLP-1 RAs have demonstrated renoprotective and antihypertensive effects, and reductions in lipid parameters. The GLP-1 RA liraglutide has also demonstrated positive effects on such markers of endothelial dysfunction as tumor necrosis factor-Î± and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. CONCLUSION: Preliminary data suggest GLP-1 RAs could benefit type 2 diabetes patients at risk for CV comorbidities. Additional studies are needed to confirm the extraglycemic and extrapancreatic effects and determine whether outcomes will translate into beneficial effects for patient care.
