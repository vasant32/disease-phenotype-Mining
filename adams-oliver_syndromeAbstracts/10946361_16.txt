We describe cortical malformations in two siblings who also had features of Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS, MIM 100300). The parents were first cousins and showed no signs of either disorder, suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance. Psychomotor delay was present in both sibs, and cerebral imaging was indicative of polymicrogyria (PMG). One sib had aplasia cutis congenita of the scalp and transverse limb defects, and the other had short fingers and toes and also developed lymphedema of the right leg. CNS abnormalities and lymphatic abnormalities are rare manifestations of AOS, and we suggest that these sibs have a rare variant of AOS with probable recessive inheritance.
