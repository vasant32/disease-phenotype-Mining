We investigated two single nucleotide polymorphisms of the NOS3 gene in type 2 diabetic patients (n=93) and healthy non-diabetic controls (n=76) and their relationship with smoking habits, body mass index, hypertension and dyslipidemia. Results showed that eNOS polymorphism rs891512 (G24943A) is associated with hypertension in Chilean individuals (p<0.05).
