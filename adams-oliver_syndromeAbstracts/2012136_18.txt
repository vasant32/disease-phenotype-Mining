We report on 2 families having members affected with the Poland sequence and Adams-Oliver syndrome. In the first family, a 5-month-old boy presented with Adams-Oliver syndrome; his mother had Poland sequence. In the second family, a 12-year-old boy and his mother presented with findings suggestive of Adams-Oliver syndrome and Poland sequence. This suggests that the same genetic predisposition may result in either or both conditions.
