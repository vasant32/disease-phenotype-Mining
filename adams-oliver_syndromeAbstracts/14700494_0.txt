A case of cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita (CMTC) is reported. A young girl had an unusual presentation with sclerosis in the skin lesions, senile features, hypoplasia of the mandible, transverse nail dystrophy, and transverse toe defects resembling Adams-Oliver syndrome. These associated abnormalities are very rare and some have not been documented before with CMTC. The possible relationship of CMTC with Adams-Oliver syndrome is also discussed.
