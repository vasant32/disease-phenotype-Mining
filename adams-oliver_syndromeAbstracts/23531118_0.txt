AIM: To prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of alogliptin versus glipizide in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) over 1 year of treatment. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study of elderly T2DM patients (aged 65-90 years) with mild hyperglycemia on diet/exercise therapy alone (glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c] 6.5%-9.0%) or plus oral antidiabetic monotherapy (HbA1c 6.5%-8.0%). Patients were randomized to once-daily alogliptin 25 mg or glipizide 5 mg titrated to 10 mg, if needed. Hypoglycemic episodes were systematically captured under predefined criteria. RESULTS: In the primary analysis, HbA1c mean changes from a baseline of 7.5% were -0.14% with alogliptin (n = 222) and -0.09% with glipizide (n = 219) at study end, demonstrating noninferiority of alogliptin to glipizide (least squares [LS] mean difference = -0.05%; 1-sided 97.5% confidence interval [CI]: - ∞, 0.13%). More clinically relevant HbA1c reductions occurred among patients who completed the study: -0.42% and -0.33% with alogliptin and glipizide, with noninferiority again confirmed (LS mean difference = -0.09%; 1-sided 97.5% CI: - ∞, 0.07%). Overall, alogliptin was safe and well tolerated, with notably fewer hypoglycemic episodes than glipizide (5.4% [31 episodes] vs. 26.0% [232episodes], respectively); 3 patients experienced severe hypoglycemia, all with glipizide. Alogliptin also resulted in favorable weight changes versus glipizide (-0.62 vs. 0.60 kg at week 52; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Alogliptin monotherapy maintained glycemic control comparable to that of glipizide in elderly patients with T2DM over 1 year of treatment, with substantially lower risk of hypoglycemia and without weight gain.
