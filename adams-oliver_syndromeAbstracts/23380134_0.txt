Diabetic macular edema (DME) is the most common cause of vision loss in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Glycemic control, hypertension, and dyslipidemia are known to be important risks factors for DME. In addition, nephropathy, anemia, sleep apnea, glitazone usage, and pregnancy are also important modifiable risk factors. It is important for physicians of different subspecialties to work together and understand multiple aspects of DME and diabetic healthcare.
