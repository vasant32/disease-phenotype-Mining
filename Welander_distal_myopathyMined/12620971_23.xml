<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies in desmin (-/-) mice have shown that the targeted ablation of desmin leads to pathological changes of the extrasarcomeric intermediate filament cytoskeleton, as well as structural and functional abnormalities of mitochondria in striated muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report on a novel heterozygous single <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> insertion mutation (c.5141_5143insA) in a 40-year-old patient with a distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The insertion mutation leads to a frameshift and a truncated desmin (K239fs242) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using transfection studies in SW13 and BHK21 cells, we show that the K239fsX242 desmin mutant is incapable of forming a desmin intermediate filament network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it induces the collapse of a pre-existing desmin cytoskeleton, alters the subcellular distribution of mitochondria and leads to abnormal cytoplasmic protein aggregates reminiscent of desmin-immunoreactive granulofilamentous material seen in the ultrastructural analysis of the patient's muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function in isolated saponin-permeablized skeletal muscle fibres from our patient showed decreased maximal rates of respiration with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi>-dependent substrate combination <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and malate, as well as a higher <z:chebi fb="19" ids="2673">amytal</z:chebi> sensitivity of respiration, indicating an in vivo inhibition of complex I activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the heterozygous K239fsX242 desmin insertion mutation has a dominant negative effect on the polymerization process of desmin intermediate filaments and affects not only the subcellular distribution, but also biochemical properties of mitochondria in diseased human skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, the intermediate filament pathology-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction may contribute to the degeneration/regeneration process leading to progressive muscle dysfunction in human desminopathies </plain></SENT>
