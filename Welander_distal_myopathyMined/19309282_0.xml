<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Absence of dysferlin in frozen muscle biopsy allowed diagnostic confirmation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these two patients, two mutations not previously identified in other populations were found: a homozygous c.1948delC (p.Leu650TyrfsX6) was found in the male patient; the heterozygous mutation c.1276G&gt;A (p.Gly426Arg) was found in the female patient in association with the previously reported c.2858dupT (p.Phe954ValfsX2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first time that mutations in DYSF are identified in native Chileans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest the possibility that mutations in the DYSF gene were present in the Native American population before colonization </plain></SENT>
