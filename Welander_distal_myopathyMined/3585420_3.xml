<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An ultrastructural study of biopsied muscles was performed in seven patients with rimmed vacuolar distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, which was characterized by prominent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> in the muscle fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The earliest changes noted were focal proliferation of the Golgi's apparatus and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> degeneration with myofibrillar loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A proliferation of the T-system appeared later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary lysosomes (autophagosomes) could be noted much later and gradually increased in number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autophagosomes tended to coalesce and became larger <z:hpo ids='HP_0003736'>autophagic vacuoles</z:hpo>, which were surrounded in part by relatively preserved myofibrils and partly by a single membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gently curved laminated structures (tubulomembranous structures) were seen in the degenerating muscle fibers and also in relatively intact fibers, satellite cells, and interstitial cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They were closely associated with lipofuscin-like material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that an abnormality of the lysosomal system might be essential in the pathogenesis of rimmed vacuolar distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
