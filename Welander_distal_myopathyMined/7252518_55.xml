<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disorder seemed to be inherited through an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> trait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The EMG demonstrated a myopathic pattern and CPK was mildly elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The striking finding in their muscle biopsies was the presence of "rimmed" vacuoles which had acid phosphatase-positive autophagic activity and which contained numerous concentric lamellar bodies in various forms (myeloid and cabbage bodies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite rapid clinical progression, not only necrotic fibers with phagocytosis, as seen in Duchenne <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath>, but also evidence of regeneration were virtually absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Continuous destruction of myofibrils by activation of certain lysosomal proteolytic enzymes might be responsible for the production of atrophic fibers </plain></SENT>
