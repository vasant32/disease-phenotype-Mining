<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The neurologic examinations were otherwise <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Motor nerve conduction velocities were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, whereas compound muscle action potentials from the interosseous muscles were decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings were consistent with a primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 3rd pup from a different litter and a 4th pup from a litter with 3 of 8 affected dogs had similar clinical presentations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histopathologic changes in fresh-frozen muscle biopsy samples were similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pups and consisted of myofiber <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> with mild myonecrosis, endomysial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and replacement of muscle with fatty tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These changes were more severe in distal muscles than in proximal muscles </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Muscle <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> concentrations (total and free) were decreased in 3 of 4 pups and the least affected pup had a borderline low free muscle <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities involving major metabolic pathways were not found on quantification of organic and amino acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Dystrophin immunocytochemistry was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 2 dogs tested </plain></SENT>
