<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To characterise a Swedish family with a rare hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with unique sarcoplasmic inclusion bodies in the muscle biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Part of the pedigree was described in 1980 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine new members of the included and the phenotype further characterised through clinical, neurophysiological and radiological investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six of the nine subjects displayed clinical and/or laboratory evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with sarcoplasmic inclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sarcoplasmic body <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> is distinguished from other distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> by a more malignant course and early involvement of thenar muscles and hand flexors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five to ten years after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> the affected subjects develop distal, as well as proximal, <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and the majority require a wheelchair after ten to fifteen years of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The disorder is manifested through <z:hpo ids='HP_0003236'>elevated creatine kinase</z:hpo> levels and the presence of the pathognomonic sarcoplasmic inclusions prior to clinical signs and symptoms </plain></SENT>
