<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Four different phenotypes have been associated with CAV3 mutations: <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>-1C (LGMD-1C), rippling muscle disease (RMD), and distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (DM), as well as idiopathic and familial hyperCKemia (HCK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Detailed molecular characterization of two caveolin-3 mutations (P104L and DeltaTFT), associated with LGMD-1C, shows them to impart a dominant-negative effect on <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> caveolin-3, rendering it dysfunctional through sequestration in the Golgi complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, substitution of glutamine for arginine at amino acid position 26 (R26Q) of caveolin-3 is associated not only with RMD but also with DM and HCK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the phenotypic behavior of the caveolin-3 R26Q mutation has never been evaluated in cultured cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus we characterized the cellular and molecular properties of the R26Q mutant protein to better understand how this mutation can manifest as such distinct disease phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that the caveolin-3 R26Q mutant is mostly retained at the level of the Golgi complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The caveolin-3 R26Q mutant formed oligomers of a much larger size than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> caveolin-3 and was excluded from caveolae-enriched membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, caveolin-3 R26Q did not behave in a dominant-negative fashion when coexpressed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> caveolin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus the R26Q mutation behaves differently from other caveolin-3 mutations (P104L and DeltaTFT) that have been previously characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data provide a possible explanation for the scope of the various disease phenotypes associated with the caveolin-3 R26Q mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We propose a haploinsufficiency model in which reduced levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> caveolin-3, although not rendered dysfunctional due to the caveolin-3 R26Q mutant protein, are insufficient for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> muscle cell function </plain></SENT>
