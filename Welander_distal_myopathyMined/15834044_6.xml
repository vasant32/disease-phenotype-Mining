<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is not clear how the same GNE gene mutations can result in different phenotypes in the same family with DMRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical, neurophysiological, histopathological, and genetic characteristics of two patients with DMRV from a Chinese family from Taiwan were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two novel compound heterozygous mutations in different domains of the protein, Ile241Ser in the epimerase and Trp513stop in the kinase domain, were detected in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the two patients demonstrated different patterns of disease progression: one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slow disease progression</z:hpo> with a typical feature of DMRV (that is, <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> beginning in the distal leg muscles, typically anterior tibialis, with the quadriceps remaining relatively unaffected), and the other had rapid disease progression with an atypical presentation of DMRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study indicate that GNE gene mutations and probably modifier gene(s) or additional factors may result in different phenotypes of DMRV </plain></SENT>
