<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To detect gene mutations on beta-myosin heavy chain gene MYH7 in 3 Chinese families with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM), and to analyze the correlation between genotype and phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and sequencing mutation screening of the exons (exon3-23) coding for MYH7 gene were performed in 3 Chinese families with HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this study, we identified several mutations in MYH7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A mutation of Thr441Met previously reported in a patient with Laing distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> was first identified in one Chinese pedigree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study illustrated the high frequency of mutation in MYH7 gene in Chinese HCM families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Different mutations and carriers of the MYH7 gene present phenotypic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutation screening and analysis in HCM family could therefore facilitate the early HCM diagnosis and would be helpful for the prediction, prevention and early treatment of HCM linked with MYH7 gene mutation </plain></SENT>
