<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>Muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo> (mdm) is a recessive mouse mutation with severe and progressive muscular degeneration caused by a deletion in the N2A domain of titin (TTN-N2ADelta83), disrupting a putative binding site for CAPN3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> in mutant mdm mice is caused by misregulation of CAPN3 activity, genetic crosses with CAPN3 overexpressing transgenic (C3Tg) and CAPN3 knockout (C3KO) mice were generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that overexpression of CAPN3 exacerbates the mdm disease, leading to a <z:mp ids='MP_0002083'>shorter life span</z:mp> and more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in a direct genetic test of CAPN3's role as a mediator of mdm pathology, C3KO;mdm double mutant mice showed no change in the progression or severity of disease indicating that aberrant CAPN3 activity is not a primary mechanism in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine whether we could detect a functional deficit in titin in a non-disease state, we examined the treadmill locomotion of heterozygous +/mdm mice and detected a significant increase in stride time with a concomitant increase in stance time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, these altered gait parameters were completely corrected by CAPN3 overexpression in transgenic C3Tg;+/mdm mice, supporting a CAPN3-dependent role for the N2A domain of TTN in the dynamics of muscle contraction </plain></SENT>
