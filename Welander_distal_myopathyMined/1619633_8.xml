<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A family study was carried out to clarify the problem of two separate muscle disease phenotypes in a large consanguineous pedigree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These were a severe limb-girdle type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and a mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two first degree and 14 other relatives of 18 previously examined index patients were available for clinical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three subjects underwent computed tomography of the lower leg muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No new cases of limb-girdle type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 14 subjects, 10 first degree relatives and four other relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Segregation analysis showed that the corrected proportion of affected with the severe proximal type was 0.246 and the proportion of affected with the distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> was 0.58 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pedigree analysis is compatible with the possibility that the mild, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> is caused by a dominant gene and that the limb-girdle type may be expressed in homozygotes </plain></SENT>
