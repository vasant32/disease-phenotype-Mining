<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical, pathological, laboratory test and follow-up data between familial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> patients with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> (DMRV) and discuss the characteristics of this disorder in Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical and pathological features, laboratory data and follow-up results of 33 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and 4 familial cases of pathologically confirmed DMRV were summarized and compared retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age, or disease duration showed no significant difference between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and familial cases; the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> pattern and affected muscle groups were also similar, but the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases showed more frequent dysmorphic features than the familial cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients showed mild to moderate elevation of the muscle enzymes by one to three folds, and the familial patients had more significant elevation than the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between the disease duration and the level of muscle enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pathological findings were similar between the cases, and Gomori staining showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> and inclusion bodies without inflammatory cell infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up results of 29 cases showed no significant difference between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The disease was <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo> and severely affected the quality of life of the patients, but did not produce obvious effect on the life expectancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The clinical, pathological and laboratory data of Chinese DMRV patients are basically similar to those of Japanese cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>Sporadic</z:hpo> cases tend to show more dysmorphic features than the familial ones, and occasional <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases have early disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in early childhood </plain></SENT>
