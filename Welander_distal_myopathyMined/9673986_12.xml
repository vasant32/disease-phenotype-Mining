<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A Saudi family with five siblings aged 3-25 years, an unrelated 18-year-old woman and a 40-year-old man with MM were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent a neurological examination, serum chemistry, electromyography and MRI of the legs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four patients underwent a muscle biopsy that was processed for routine enzyme histochemistry and immunocytochemical analyses for dystrophin and adhalin (alpha-sarcoglycan) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and two familial cases showed classic findings of MM, including early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo>, preferential involvement of gastrocnemius muscles, markedly <z:hpo ids='HP_0003236'>elevated serum creatine kinase</z:hpo> levels and dystrophic-appearing muscle without vacuoles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging revealed selective involvement of the posterior compartment muscles and myoedema by STIR sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining three familial cases had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003236'>elevated serum creatine kinase</z:hpo> levels and two also had early myopathic findings by EMG suggestive of MM </plain></SENT>
