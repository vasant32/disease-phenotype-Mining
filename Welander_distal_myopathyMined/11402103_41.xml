<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dysferlin immunolocalizes to the muscle fiber periphery but does not associate with the dystrophin--<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> complex; its function in humans, and the mechanism by which it causes muscle fiber injury, are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors therefore searched for pathogenetic clues by examining early abnormalities in nonnecrotic muscle fibers in dysferlinopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five dysferlin-deficient patients were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>Weakness</z:mp> was distal in two, proximal in one, and both proximal and distal in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient 5 was only mildly affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunoblot analysis, membrane attack complex (MAC) immunolocalization, and quantitative electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In Patients 1 through 4, but not in 5, part or the entire surface of isolated nonnecrotic muscle fibers immunostained for MAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Quantitative electron microscopy of 175 nonnecrotic muscle fibers revealed one or more of the following: 1) small (0.11 to 1.8 microm) plasmalemmal defects in 64% of fibers; 2) thickened basal lamina over some defects; 3) replacement of the plasma membrane by one to multiple layers of small vesicles in 57% of fibers; 4) papillary projections, frequently disintegrating, in 24 to 36% of fibers in Patients 1 through 4 but absent in fibers of Patient 5; 5) small subsarcolemmal vacuoles, some undergoing exocytosis, in 57% of fibers; and 6) infrequent subsarcolemmal regions containing rough endoplasmic reticulum and abundant free ribosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dysferlin is likely required for maintaining the structural integrity of the muscle fiber plasma membrane, and plasma membrane injury is an early event in the pathogenesis of dysferlinopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MAC activation can participate in but is not an initial or primary event causing muscle fiber injury </plain></SENT>
