<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Nebulin is a large actin-binding protein of the skeletal muscle sarcomere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multiple isoforms of nebulin are produced from the 183-exon-containing nebulin gene (NEB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in NEB cause nemaline <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, and core-rod <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nebulin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was assessed by microarrays and RT-PCR in 21 human leg muscle and 2 brain samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in 5 regions of 1 brain sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nebulin isoform diversity is as high in brain as in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Isoforms with more than 22 super repeats seem to be more common than previously anticipated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry showed nebulin expression predominantly in the cytoplasm of pyramidal neurons but also in the cytoplasm of mainly subcortical endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nebulin, as in skeletal muscle, may have a role as an actin filament stabilizer or length regulator in neurons of the human brain, although patients with NEB mutations usually have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognition </plain></SENT>
