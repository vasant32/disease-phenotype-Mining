<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Desmuslin is an alpha-dystrobrevin-interacting protein expressed primarily in heart and skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The desmuslin protein interacts with and is closely related to desmin, a protein encoded by a locus mutated in some forms of hereditary distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a muscle-specific intermediate filament protein, desmuslin is also a candidate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> of unknown etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The desmuslin gene was localized to chromosome 15q26.3 by electronic screening of the human DNA sequence database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primer pairs were designed to amplify the 5 exons of the desmuslin gene in 11 overlapping DNA segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The desmuslin gene was screened for mutations in 71 patients with various forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> for which there was no known cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this analysis, 10 common and 2 rare amino acid altering single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were seen in a control population of individuals thus making these unlikely causes of the phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, one of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms found in a patient resulted in a premature stop codon in the first exon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The nonsense mutation was also detected in the patient's unaffected father and one unaffected control; it was detected in 0.44% (2/454) of unrelated chromosomes and is therefore predicted to have a homozygous frequency of 0.002% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: No causative mutations were found in the desmuslin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the single-nucleotide polymorphisms mapped in this study represent a well-mapped group that can be used for disequilibrium studies of this region of chromosome 15q26.3 </plain></SENT>
