<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The dominant tibial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (TMD) and recessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> 2J are allelic disorders caused by mutations in the C-terminus of titin, a giant sarcomeric protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both clinical presentations were initially identified in a large Finnish family and linked to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutation (FINmaj) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To further understand the physiopathology of these two diseases, we generated a mouse model carrying the FINmaj mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In heterozygous mice, dystrophic myopathology appears late at 9 months of age in few distal muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In homozygous (HO) mice, the first signs appear in the Soleus at 1 month of age and extend to most muscles at 6 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the heart is also severely affected in HO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mutation leads to the loss of the very C-terminal end of titin and to a secondary deficiency of calpain 3, a partner of titin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By crossing the FINmaj model with a calpain 3-deficient model, the TMD phenotype was corrected, demonstrating a participation of calpain 3 in the pathogenesis of this disease </plain></SENT>
