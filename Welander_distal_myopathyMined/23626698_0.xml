<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The establishment of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) has enabled the production of in vitro, patient-specific cell models of human disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro recreation of disease pathology from patient-derived hiPSCs depends on efficient differentiation protocols producing relevant adult cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, myogenic differentiation of hiPSCs has faced obstacles, namely, low efficiency and/or poor reproducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the rapid, efficient, and reproducible differentiation of hiPSCs into mature myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that inducible expression of myogenic differentiation1 (MYOD1) in immature hiPSCs for at least 5 days drives cells along the myogenic lineage, with efficiencies reaching 70-90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Myogenic differentiation driven by MYOD1 occurred even in immature, almost completely undifferentiated hiPSCs, without mesodermal transition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Myocytes induced in this manner reach maturity within 2 weeks of differentiation as assessed by marker gene expression and functional properties, including in vitro and in vivo cell fusion and <z:mp ids='MP_0005424'>twitching</z:mp> in response to electrical stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Miyoshi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>Myopathy</z:hpo> (MM) is a congenital distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> caused by defective muscle membrane repair due to mutations in DYSFERLIN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using our induced differentiation technique, we successfully recreated the pathological condition of MM in vitro, demonstrating defective membrane repair in hiPSC-derived myotubes from an MM patient and phenotypic rescue by expression of full-length DYSFERLIN (DYSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings not only facilitate the pathological investigation of MM, but could potentially be applied in modeling of other human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026848" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">muscular diseases</z:e> by using patient-derived hiPSCs </plain></SENT>
