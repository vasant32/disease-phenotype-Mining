<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report 12 cases with clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three groups of patients could be described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first one corresponded to asymmetrical muscle involvement and distribution with a slow clinical course (4 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second was characterized by a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085655" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polymyositis</z:e>-like syndrome (3 cas), but steroid therapy was ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The last group mimicked a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0007269'>spinal muscular atrophy</z:hpo> (4 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient showed a scapuloperoneal syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both myopathic and neurogenic EMG patterns were present in 6 patients; a neurogenic pattern was found in 4 cases and a myopathic pattern in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, muscle biopsies showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> with eosinophilic inclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 9 cases ultrastructural studies displayed abnormal filaments of 15-18 nm in diameter in the vacuoles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intranuclear filaments were rarely observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The significance of the filaments is unknown and their specificity is doubtful because they are present in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> (some distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> and oculopharyngeal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Finally a rich inflammatory exudate was present in 8 patients only </plain></SENT>
