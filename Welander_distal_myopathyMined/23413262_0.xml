<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rod-shaped dimers of tropomyosin regulate actin-myosin interactions and β-tropomyosin mutations have been associated with nemaline <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, cap <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, Escobar syndrome and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005684'>distal arthrogryposis</z:hpo> types 1A and 2B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we expand the allelic spectrum of β-tropomyosin-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> through the identification of a novel β-tropomyosin mutation in two clinical contexts not previously associated with β-tropomyosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first clinical phenotype is core-rod <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, with a β-tropomyosin mutation uncovered by whole exome sequencing in a family with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> and muscle biopsy features of both minicores and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003798'>nemaline rods</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second phenotype, observed in four unrelated families, is <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000211'>trismus</z:hpo>-pseudocamptodactyly syndrome (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005684'>distal arthrogryposis</z:hpo> type 7; previously associated exclusively with myosin heavy chain 8 mutations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four families, the mutation identified was a novel 3-bp in-frame deletion (c.20_22del) that results in deletion of a conserved lysine at the seventh amino acid position (p.K7del) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the first mutation identified in the extreme N-terminus of β-tropomyosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To understand the potential pathogenic mechanism(s) underlying this mutation, we performed both computational analysis and in vivo modelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our theoretical model predicts that the mutation disrupts the N-terminus of the α-helices of dimeric β-tropomyosin, a change predicted to alter protein-protein binding between β-tropomyosin and other molecules and to disturb head-to-tail polymerization of β-tropomyosin dimers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To create an in vivo model, we expressed <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> or p.K7del β-tropomyosin in the developing zebrafish. p.K7del β-tropomyosin fails to localize properly within the thin filament compartment and its expression alters sarcomere length, suggesting that the mutation interferes with head-to-tail β-tropomyosin polymerization and with overall sarcomeric structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We describe a novel β-tropomyosin mutation, two clinical-histopathological phenotypes not previously associated with β-tropomyosin and pathogenic data from the first animal model of β-tropomyosin-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
