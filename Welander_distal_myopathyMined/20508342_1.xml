<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> (DMRV) is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> (AR) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> characterized clinically by the preferential involvement of the tibialis anterior and has been reported predominantly in the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case series of DMRV patients seen over a period of 3 years at a tertiary national referral center for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> in south India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We describe the clinical characteristics, muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and classical histopathological feature in 23 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 12 men and 11 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> was 27.04 +/- 6.35 years (10-39 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>Onset</z:hpo> was in the second or third decade in a majority </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean age at presentation was 33.95 +/- 6.35 years (25-48 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of illness was 6.74 +/- 4.8 years (1-18 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consanguinity was reported in eight (34.8%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The predominant and initial manifestation was bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003377'>foot drop</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Muscle MRI demonstrated classical involvement of the anterior compartment muscles of the lower legs and the posterior compartment muscles of the thighs and the quadriceps was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Muscle histopathology showed numerous fibers containing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Necrotic fibers or phagocytosis or regenerating fibers were rarely noted or were absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DMRV is a rare AR <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The disorder presents as progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003377'>foot drop</z:hpo> and hence has many differential diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It is easily mistaken as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> of hereditary nature and hence it is extremely important to recognize the preferential muscle involvement and characterize the phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This is the first report from India with patients having characteristic phenotype of Nonaka's/AR hereditary inclusion body <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with quadriceps sparing, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were confirmed by histopathology </plain></SENT>
