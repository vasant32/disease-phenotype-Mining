<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several desmin mutations have been described in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> and distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among them, A213V substitution has been associated with three completely different clinical phenotypes: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001723'>restrictive cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and isolated distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the identification of this substitution also in control subjects has highlighted the question if the A213V shift represents a conditional mutation, giving rise to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> only in the presence of other predisposing factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present work was to study the potential role of this substitution in predisposing to <z:mp ids='MP_0004937'>heart dilation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methods and results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We screened 108 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004937'>heart dilation</z:mp> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, alcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp>, and 300 healthy controls for the presence of A213V substitution by direct sequencing and confirmed the results by site-specific restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the control group A213V substitution was identified in 3 out of 300 patients, representing a rare polymorphism with a frequency of approximately 1%, which corresponds to the earlier reported frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the study group A213V substitution was found in 5 out of 108 cases, corresponding to approximately 4.6% (p &lt; 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore we conclude that A213V desmin substitution represents a conditional mutation, i.e. a rare polymorphism that plays a role as a predisposing factor resulting in maladaptive heart remodelling in the presence of other pathological factors </plain></SENT>
