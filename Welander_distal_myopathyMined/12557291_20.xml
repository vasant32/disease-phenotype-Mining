<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the human caveolin-3 gene (cav-3) on chromosome 3p25 have been described in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, rippling muscle disease, hyperCKemia, and distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe the genetic, myopathological, and clinical findings in a large German family harboring a novel heterozygous mutation (GAC--&gt;GAA) in codon 27 of the cav-3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This missense mutation causes an amino acid change from asparagine to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> (Asp27Glu) in the N-terminal region of the Cav-3 protein, which leads to a drastic decrease of Cav-3 protein expression in skeletal muscle tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In keeping with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo>, this novel cav-3 mutation was found to cosegregate with neuromuscular involvement in the reported family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural analysis of Cav-3-deficient muscle showed an abnormal folding of the plasma membrane as well as multiple vesicular structures in the subsarcolemmal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nine subjects from three generations harboring the novel cav-3 mutation showed clear evidence of rippling muscle disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, only two of these nine patients showed isolated signs of rippling muscle disease without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, whereas five had additional signs of a distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> and two fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of a coexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that mutations in the human cav-3 gene can lead to different and overlapping clinical phenotypes even within the same family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Different clinical phenotypes in caveolinopathies may be attributed to so far unidentified modifying factors/genes in the individual genetic background of affected patients </plain></SENT>
