<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The term filaminopathy was introduced after a truncating mutation in the dimerization domain of filamin C (FLNc) was shown to be responsible for a devastating muscle disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the same mutation was found in patients from diverse ethnical origins, indicating that this specific alteration is a mutational hot spot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients initially present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003701'>proximal muscle weakness</z:hpo>, while distal and respiratory muscles become affected with disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsies of these patients show typical signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003715'>myofibrillar myopathy</z:hpo>, including disintegration of myofibrils and aggregation of several proteins into distinct intracellular deposits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Highly similar phenotypes were observed in patients with other mutations in Ig-like domains of FLNc that result in expression of a noxious protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biochemical and biophysical studies showed that the mutated domains acquire an abnormal structure causing decreased stability and eventually becoming a seed for abnormal aggregation with other proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The disease usually presents only after the fourth decade of life possibly as a result of ageing-related impairments in the machinery that is responsible for disposal of damaged proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is confirmed by mutations in components of this machinery that cause a highly similar phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transfection studies of cultured muscle cells reflect the events observed in patient muscles and, therefore, may provide a helpful model for testing future dedicated therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More recently, FLNC mutations were also found in families with a distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> phenotype, caused either by mutations in the actin-binding domain of FLNc that result in increased actin-binding and non-specific myopathic abnormalities without <z:hpo ids='HP_0003715'>myofibrillar myopathy</z:hpo> pathology, or a nonsense mutation in the rod domain that leads to <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> instability, haploinsufficiency with decreased expression levels of FLNc in the muscle fibers and myofibrillar abnormalities, but not to the formation of desmin-positive protein aggregates required for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003715'>myofibrillar myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
