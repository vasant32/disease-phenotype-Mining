<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients present with spared quadriceps muscles even in a late stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hamstring and tibialis anterior muscles are affected severely in early adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have localized the NM gene to the region between markers D9S319 and D9S276 on chromosome 9 by linkage analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To further refine the localization of the NM gene, we conducted homozygosity and linkage disequilibrium analysis for 14 patients from 11 NM families using 18 polymorphic markers </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also provided evidence for significant allelic associations between the NM region and five marker loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Examination of the haplotype analysis identified a predominant ancestral haplotype comprising the associated alleles 199-160-154-109 (marker order: D9S2179-D9S2180-D9S2181-D9S1804), present in 60% of NM chromosomes and in 0% of parent chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the data obtained in this study, the majority of NM chromosomes were derived from a single ancestral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e>, and the NM gene is probably located within the 1.5-Mb region between markers D9S2178 and D9S1791 </plain></SENT>
