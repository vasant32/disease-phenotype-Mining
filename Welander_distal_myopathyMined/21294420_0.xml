<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine of eleven patients had elevated CK concentrations ranging from 338 to 1023 IU/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinicopathological correlation revealed specific diagnoses in nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Suspected cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> neurogastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (MNGIE), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003715'>myofibrillar myopathy</z:hpo> (MFM) and distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> (DMRV) were confirmed by molecular genetic studies examining <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> phosphorylase, GNE, ZASP myotilin, desmin, abeta-crystalline and filamin C genes </plain></SENT>
