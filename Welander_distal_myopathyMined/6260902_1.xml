<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sarcoplasmic bodies were glassy, drop-shaped structures up to 10 microns of length and easily distinguished in the scanning mode of electron microscopy performed on thick freeze-dried cryosections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were found to be source of X-ray spectra characterized by a high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26833">sulfur</z:chebi> peak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On semithin <z:chebi fb="48" ids="30721">epoxy</z:chebi> sections the sarcoplasmic bodies were observed in the scanning transmission mode as electron-dense structures which, according to X-ray microanalysis, exhibited a high sulphur and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30687">osmium</z:chebi> content, possibly indicating the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29917">sulphydryl groups</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003798'>nemaline rods</z:hpo> were of 3 different types as judged by their light-microscopical appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were, however, not visible in the scanning mode of electron microscopy performed on freeze-dried unstained cryosections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were small differences in the elemental composition between different rods within the same biopsy but these were not systematically related to the differences in morphological appearance </plain></SENT>
