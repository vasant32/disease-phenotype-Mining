<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is pathologically characterized by the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> (RVs), especially in atrophic fibers, which also occasionally contain congophilic materials that are immunoreactive to beta-amyloid, lysosomal proteins, ubiquitin and tau proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the pathomechanism of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> and to explore treatment options, we generated a mouse model of DMRV/hIBM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We knocked out the Gne gene in mice but this resulted in <z:mp ids='MP_0008762'>embryonic lethality</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore generated a transgenic mouse that expressed the human GNE D176V mutation, which is one of the most prevalent mutations among Japanese DMRV patients, and crossed this with Gne(+/-) mice to obtain Gne(-/-)hGNED176V-Tg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, these mice exhibit marked hyposialylation in serum, muscle and other organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reduction in motor performance in these mice can only be seen from 30 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A compelling finding is the development of beta-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath> in myofibers by 32 weeks, which clearly precedes RV formation at 42 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results show that the Gne(-/-)hGNED176V-Tg mouse mimics the clinical, histopathological and biochemical features of DMRV/hIBM, making it useful for understanding the pathomechanism of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> and for employing different strategies for therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings underscore the notion that hyposialylation plays an important role in the pathomechanism of DMRV/hIBM </plain></SENT>
