<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The dysferlin gene product is a membrane-associated protein belonging to the ferlins family of proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The function of the dysferlin protein and the cause of deterioration and regression of muscle fibres in its absence, are incompletely known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A functional clue may be the presence of six hydrophilic domains, C2, that bind calcium and mediate the interaction of proteins with cellular membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dysferlin seems to be involved in the membrane fusion or repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Molecular diagnosis of dysferlinopathies is now possible and the types of gene alterations that have been characterized so far include missense mutations, deletions and insertions </plain></SENT>
