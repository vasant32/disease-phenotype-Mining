<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: MM is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> that arises from mutations in the dysferlin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This gene is also mutated in families with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> 2B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors examined 25 Japanese patients with MM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral lymphocytes of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The PCR products of each of 55 exons were screened by single strand conformation polymorphism or direct sequencing from the PCR fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The authors identified 16 different mutations in 20 patients with MM; 10 were novel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutations in Japanese patients are distributed along the entire length of the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Four mutations (C1939G, G3370T, 3746delG, and 4870delT) are relatively more prevalent in this population, accounting for 60% of the mutations in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study revealed that the G3370T mutation was associated with milder forms of MM and the G3510A mutation was associated with a more severe form </plain></SENT>
