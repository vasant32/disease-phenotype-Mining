<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We presented the clinical, pathological and genetic characteristics of eight Chinese DMRV patients from six unrelated families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six previously reported Chinese DMRV patients from four unrelated families were also reviewed for comparison in GNE mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present eight patients with DMRV, direct sequencing analysis revealed one homozygous mutation of c.1760T&gt;C (p.I587T) and seven compound heterozygous mutations in the GNE gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latter included two known mutations, c.1892C&gt;T (p.A631V) and c.527A&gt;T (p.D176V), and three novel mutations, c.1523T&gt;C (p.L508S), c.103G&gt;A (p.E35K) and c.153A&gt;G (p.I51M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The allelic frequency of c.1523T&gt;C (p.L508S) was 25% in the Chinese patients with DMRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings expand the genetic spectrum of DMRV and indicate that the common mutations of GNE gene in DMRV may be variable among different ethnic populations </plain></SENT>
