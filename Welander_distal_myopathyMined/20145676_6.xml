<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim is to reframe dystrophin transcripts using antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These hide an exon from the splicing machinery to induce exon skipping, restoration of the reading frame and generation of internally deleted, but partially functional proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It thus relies on the characteristic of the dystrophin protein, which has essential N- and C-terminal domains, whereas the central rod domain is largely redundant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This approach may also be applicable to <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> type 2B (LGMD2B), Myoshi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (MM) and distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with anterior tibial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (DMAT), which are caused by mutations in the dysferlin-encoding DYSF gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dysferlin has a function in repairing muscle membrane damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dysferlin contains calcium-dependent C2 <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> binding (C2) domains and an essential transmembrane domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, mildly affected patients in whom one or a large number of DYSF exons were missing have been described, suggesting that internally deleted dysferlin proteins can be functional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, exon skipping might also be applicable as a LGMD2B, MM and DMAT therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this study we have analyzed the dysferlin protein domains and DYSF mutations and have described what exons are promising targets with regard to applicability and feasibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We also show that DYSF exon skipping seems to be as straightforward as DMD exon skipping, as AONs to induce efficient skipping of four DYSF exons were readily identified </plain></SENT>
