<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study presents the main clinical and electrophysiological features of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007959" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Charcot-Marie-Tooth</z:e> (CMT) disease or hereditary motor and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000763'>sensory neuropathy</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HMSN</z:e>) in Northern Finland diagnosed during the period 1969-1983 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The group consists of 40 patients aged between 5 and 74 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A positive family history suggesting a dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> was seen in 23 patients--the rest were classified as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to median or sural nerve conduction velocities the disease was graded as demyelinating (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HMSN</z:e> type I) and neuronal (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HMSN type II</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A clear tendency towards an earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was seen in type I cases compared to those in type II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both clinically and neurophysiologically the lower arms were more severely affected in type I than in type II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>Muscular atrophy</z:hpo> of the legs occurred more often in type I than in type II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Electromyographic abnormalities were characteristically neurogenic, though in some advanced cases small motor unit potentials could also be seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition 2 cases originally diagnosed as CMT proved to be distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> on electromyography (EMG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>According to electrodiagnostic criteria, patients in the same family could belong to different subgroups of CMT suggesting that the present use of conduction velocities as the discriminating factor between the groups may be unsound </plain></SENT>
