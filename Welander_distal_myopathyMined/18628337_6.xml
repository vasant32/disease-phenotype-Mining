<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is caused by mutations in the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) gene that is important in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, we generated a mouse model (Gne(-/-)hGNED176VTg) that exhibits <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> and pathological changes similar to DMRV patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To gain better understanding of the pathomechanism of DMRV, we determined temporal changes in the overall motor performance of this model mouse for DMRV in correlation with the structure and function of isolated skeletal muscles and muscle pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These DMRV mice exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo>, decreased whole muscle mass and cross-sectional area (CSA), and reduced contractile power in an age-related manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Single-fiber CSA further supported the finding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle atrophy</z:hpo> that involved both type I and type II fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> is highly correlated with reduced production of force at young age, both in vivo and ex vivo, thereby implicating the important role of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in the pathomechanism of DMRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In older age, and particularly in gastrocnemius muscles, RVs and intracellular inclusions were seen in type IIA fibers, further aggravating reduction of force and specific increase in twitch-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039614" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tetanus</z:e> ratio </plain></SENT>
