<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Linkage analysis of the dominant distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> we previously identified in a large Australian family demonstrated one significant linkage region located on chromosome 7 and encompassing 18.6 Mbp and 151 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The strongest candidate gene was FLNC because filamin C, the encoded protein, is muscle-specific and associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003715'>myofibrillar myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of FLNC cDNA identified a c.752T&gt;C (p.Met251Thr) mutation in the N-terminal actin-binding domain (ABD); this mutation segregated with the disease and was absent in 200 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified an Italian family with the same phenotype and found a c.577G&gt;A (p.Ala193Thr) filamin C ABD mutation that segregated with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Filamin C ABD mutations have not been described, although filamin A and filamin B ABD mutations cause multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026857" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">musculoskeletal disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> phenotype and muscle pathology in the two families differ from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003715'>myofibrillar myopathies</z:hpo> caused by filamin C rod and dimerization domain mutations because of the distinct involvement of hand muscles and lack of pathological protein aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, like the position of FLNA and B mutations, the position of the FLNC mutation determines disease phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The two filamin C ABD mutations increase actin-binding affinity in a manner similar to filamin A and filamin B ABD mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cell-culture expression of the c.752T&gt;C (p.Met251)Thr mutant filamin C ABD demonstrated reduced nuclear localization as did mutant filamin A and filamin B ABDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Expression of both filamin C ABD mutants as full-length proteins induced increased aggregation of filamin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude filamin C ABD mutations cause a recognizable distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, most likely through increased actin affinity, similar to the pathological mechanism of filamin A and filamin B ABD mutations </plain></SENT>
