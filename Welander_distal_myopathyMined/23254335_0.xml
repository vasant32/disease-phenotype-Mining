<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The classifications of the dysferlinopathies mainly include <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> 2B (LGMD2B) with predominantly proximal <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, Miyoshi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (MM) with calf <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, and distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with anterior tibial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (DMAT) with tibialis <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe the genetic character of dysferlinopathies in a group of Chinese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DYSF mutations screening were done after muscle biopsy and immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight patients showed an absence or drastic decrease of dysferlin expression in biopsied muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified 6 different mutations, including one nonsense mutation, two insertion mutation, two deletion mutations and one splice site mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five of them were novel mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We described 8 Chinese patients with dysferlinopathy (four had a distal phenotype of MM; one had a phenotype of DMAT and three presented with LGMD2B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is the first report of genetic confirmed DMAT in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mutations c.3112C&gt;T and c.1045dup, may be recurrent mutations in China </plain></SENT>
