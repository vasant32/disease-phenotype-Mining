<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In these <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo>, it is the repair, not the structure, of the plasma membrane that is impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Though much is known about the effects of dysferlin deficiency in skeletal muscle, little is known about the role of dysferlin in maintenance of cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence suggests that dysferlin deficiency affects cardiac muscle, leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> when stressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, neither the morphological location of dysferlin in the cardiomyocyte nor the progression of the disease with age are known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined a mouse model of dysferlinopathy using light and electron microscopy as well as echocardiography and conscious electrocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We determined that dysferlin is normally localized to the intercalated disk and sarcoplasm of the cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the absence of dysferlin, cardiomyocyte membrane damage occurs and is localized to the intercalated disk and sarcoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This damage results in transient functional deficits at 10 months of age, but, unlike in skeletal muscle, the cell injury is sublethal and causes only mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> even at advanced ages </plain></SENT>
