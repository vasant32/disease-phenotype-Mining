<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The immunostaining showed negative results in the control muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In dystrophinopathy [DMD and BMD], positivity was seen mainly in type 2 fibers with no correlation to the opaque fibers and histochemical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> loading fibers in DMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In DMD carriers, a relative correlation was seen between dystrophin-negative and Fas-positive fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo>, fibers with positive staining in the vacuoles but negative in their membranes were seen at high frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In FSH, a very low frequency of positivity was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>And in myotonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath>, positivity was seen in the type 2 fibers containing the internal nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0009071'>inflammatory myopathies</z:hpo>, strong positivity was seen in the medium size fibers, and mild to moderate positivity in the fibers facing the perimysium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In neurogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026848" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">muscular disorders</z:e>, fibers with concave borders or highly atrophic fibers showed Fas-positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, there was no disease-specific Fas reaction in the human pathologic muscle samples, but the high positivity was apparent in some <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This fact of Fas antigen would reflect a pathologic state in the skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
