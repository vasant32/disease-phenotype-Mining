<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous co-immunoprecipitation studies have shown that endogenous PFK-M (phosphofructokinase, muscle-specific isoform) associates with caveolin (Cav)-3 under certain metabolic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it remains unknown whether Cav-3 expression is required for the plasma membrane recruitment and caveolar targeting of PFK-M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate that recombinant expression of Cav-3 dramatically affects the subcellular localization of PFK-M, by targeting PFK-M to the plasma membrane, and by trans-locating PFK-M to caveolae-enriched membrane domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we show that the membrane recruitment and caveolar targeting of PFK-M appears to be strictly dependent on the concentration of extracellular <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, recombinant expression of PFK-M with three Cav-3 mutants [DeltaTFT (63 to 65), P104L, and R26Q], which harbor the same mutations as seen in the human patients with Cav-3-related muscle diseases, causes a substantial reduction in PFK-M expression levels, and impedes the membrane recruitment of PFK-M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of skeletal muscle tissue samples from Cav-3(-/-) mice directly demonstrates that Cav-3 expression regulates the phenotypic behavior of PFK-M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More specifically, in Cav-3-null mice, PFK-M is no longer targeted to the plasma membrane, and is excluded from caveolar membrane domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As such, our current results may be important in understanding the pathogenesis of Cav-3-related muscle diseases, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>-1C, distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, and rippling muscle disease, that are caused by mutations within the human Cav-3 gene </plain></SENT>
