<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the protease calpain 3 (CAPN3), in turn, lead to LGMD2A, and secondary CAPN3 deficiency in LGMD2J suggests that the pathomechanisms of the diseases are linked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Yeast two-hybrid screens carried out to elucidate the molecular pathways of TMD/LGMD2J and LGMD2A resulted in the identification of myospryn (CMYA5, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>-associated 5) as a binding partner for both M-band titin and CAPN3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional yeast two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation studies confirmed both interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The interaction of myospryn and M-band titin was supported by localization of endogenous and transfected myospryn at the M-band level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Coexpression studies showed that myospryn is a proteolytic substrate for CAPN3 and suggested that myospryn may protect CAPN3 from autolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Myospryn is a muscle-specific protein of the tripartite motif superfamily, reported to function in vesicular trafficking and protein kinase A signaling and implicated in the pathogenesis of Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The novel interactions indicate a role for myospryn in the sarcomeric M-band and may be relevant for the molecular pathomechanisms of TMD/LGMD2J and LGMD2A </plain></SENT>
