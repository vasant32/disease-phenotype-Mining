<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is characterized clinically by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>skeletal muscle atrophy</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, and pathologically by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo>, which are actually accumulations of autophagic vacuoles2, 3, 4, scattered angular fibers and intracellular accumulation of amyloid and other proteins5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, no therapy is available for this debilitating <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, primarily because the disease pathomechanism has been enigmatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is known that the disease gene underlying DMRV-hIBM is GNE, encoding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">glucosamine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>)-2-epimerase and N-acetylmannosamine kinase6, 7, 8--two essential enzymes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> biosynthesis9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is still unclear, however, whether decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> production causes <z:mp ids='MP_0000749'>muscle degeneration</z:mp>, as GNE has been proposed to have roles other than for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> biosynthesis10, 11, 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By showing that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle atrophy</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> are completely prevented in a mouse model of DMRV-hIBM after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> metabolites orally, we provide evidence that hyposialylation is indeed one of the key factors in the pathomechanism of DMRV-hIBM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results support the notion that DMRV-hIBM can potentially be treated simply by giving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acids</z:chebi>, a strategy that could be applied in clinical trials in the near future </plain></SENT>
