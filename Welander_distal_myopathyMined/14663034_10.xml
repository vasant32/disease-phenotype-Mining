<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the gene encoding caveolin-3 (CAV3) underlie four distinct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1533847" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disorders of skeletal muscle</z:e>: the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> type 1C (LGMD-1C), rippling muscle disease (RMD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and familial forms of hyperCKemia, and distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To characterize a multigenerational Italian family affected by an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> myopathic disorder and to assess the expression of caveolin-3, dystrophin, dystrophin-associated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi>, and neuronal nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase in the myocardium of an affected patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical analysis involved 15 family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Skeletal muscle expression of sarcolemmal proteins was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis in three affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Caveolar structures were analyzed through electron microscopy in muscle biopsies and in one heart biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CAV3 genetic analysis showed a heterozygous 3-bp microdeletion (328-330del) in affected individuals, resulting in the loss of a phenylalanine (Phe97del) in the transmembrane domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the skeletal muscle, the mutation was associated with severe caveolin-3 deficiency and caveolar disorganization, whereas the expression of the other analyzed muscle proteins was unaltered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, caveolin-3 was expressed in myocardium at a level corresponding to about 60% of that of control individuals and was correctly localized at the myocardial cell membranes, with preservation of cardiac myofiber caveolar structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical analysis revealed the concomitant presence in this family of the following phenotypes: RMD, LGMD, and hyperCKemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intrafamilial phenotypic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> is associated with caveolin-3 Phe97 microdeletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The molecular network interacting with caveolin-3 in skeletal muscle and heart may differ </plain></SENT>
