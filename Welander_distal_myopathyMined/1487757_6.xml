<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study vacuolar degeneration was not present in 12 patients with late <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were members of a large kindred, with 26 patients showing this new form of distal leg <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a severely disabling proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> appeared in eight other members of the large consanguineous kindred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsies were obtained from clinically affected muscles, and from clinically unaffected muscles in patients with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For comparison specimens from various muscles of patients with severe proximal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histopathological changes correlating to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> were extensive in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> muscles studied in patients with proximal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath>, and in tibial anterior muscles in patients with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathic changes</z:hpo>, mainly increased internal nuclei in muscle fibers, were detected in clinically unaffected muscles in the distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The spectrum of findings is compatible with the hypothesis of previous clinical and genetic studies, indicating that the severe proximal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> could be a homozygous manifestation of the dominantly inherited gene of the distal tibial muscle <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
