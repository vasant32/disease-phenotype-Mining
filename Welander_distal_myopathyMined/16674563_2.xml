<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Located within the minimum VCPDM candidate interval, myotilin mutations also cause a similarly progressive and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> muscle disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined myotilin in VCPDM patients by sequence analysis, RT-PCR, Southern blotting, and western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We detected no defects in the myotilin gene, transcript, or protein in VCPDM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also report several useful SNPs and STRs for the analysis of myotilin in muscle diseases of suspected, yet unknown genetic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that MYOT mutations likely are not a cause of VCPDM </plain></SENT>
