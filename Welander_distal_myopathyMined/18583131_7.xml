<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Phenotypes that have so far been associated with primary caveolin-3 deficiency include <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, rippling muscle disease, distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> and hyperCKaemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is the first report describing the clinical, pathological and genetic features of patients with caveolinopathy from the UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (six families) were identified via the National Commissioning Group (NCG) service for patients with limb girdle muscle <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> in Newcastle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003326'>Myalgia</z:hpo> was the most prominent symptom in our cohort of patients and for 50% it was the reason for referral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>Muscle weakness</z:hpo> was only found in 60% of the patients, whereas rippling muscle movement was present in 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One of the patients reported episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002913'>myoglobinuria</z:hpo> and another one episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five different mutations were identified, two of which were novel and three that had previously been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Caveolinopathy needs to be considered as a differential diagnosis in a range of clinical situations, including in patients who do not have any <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Indeed, rippling muscles are a more frequent symptom than <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, and can be detected in childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Presentation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003326'>myalgia</z:hpo> is common and management of it as well as of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002913'>myoglobinuria</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> may have a major impact on the patients' quality of life </plain></SENT>
