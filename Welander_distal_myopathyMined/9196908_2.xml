<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disorder is considered as the most prevalent of the distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> and is almost only seen in Sweden and in some parts of Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On clinical, morphological and genetical grounds the disorder is clearly separated from other distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have performed linkage analysis with the MLINK program in a total of six families with microsatellite markers dispersed throughout the genome and report exclusion for the localisation of the gene of 64% of the human genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These studies have clearly separated Welander distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> from previously mapped forms of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> such as the Miyoshi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> by excluding linkage to chromosome 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The region on 14q that has been suggested to house the gene of the distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> described by Laing et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(Am J Hum Genet 1995;56:422-7), has as well been excluded by several markers </plain></SENT>
