<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (Welander) were subjected to muscle biopsy from the anterior tibial muscle (n = 4) and to nerve biopsy from the sural nerve at the ankle (n = 5) in order to elucidate a possible neurogenic component of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The type I muscle fibres had a larger mean cross-sectional area as compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and an increased variation in fibre size with both hypertrophic and atrophic fibres in one and the same biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> muscle fibre type composition was found in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Structural muscle fibre abnormalities such as atrophic fibres, mainly angulated, split fibres, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> and centrally located nuclei were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A disorganization and loss of myofibrils as well as autolytic vacuoles were the most prominent findings at the ultrastructural level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients had a moderate loss of myelinated sural nerve fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean nerve fibre density was decreased as compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls while the mean nerve fibre area and circular diameter were increased due to selective loss of small diameter (A-delta) nerve fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The muscle and nerve fibre abnormalities are discussed with reference to neuropathic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathic changes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Some muscle fibre abnormalities are typical for a neurogenic disorder while some others are mostly seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> but may also appear in neurogenic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A neurogenic etiology in Welander distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> is further supported by the finding of loss of small diameter nerve fibres in the sural nerve </plain></SENT>
