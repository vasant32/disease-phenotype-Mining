<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 53-year-old man presented mild, but gradually worsening, distal-dominant upper bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003690'>limbs weakness</z:hpo> and muscle cramp in both legs from the age of 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He had no obvious <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle atrophy</z:hpo> during the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsy of the right lateral vastus muscle showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathic changes</z:hpo> with round or helical hyaline inclusions in eosinophilic on H&amp;E staining and dark green on modified Gomori trichrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were also non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi>-TR showed lack of enzymic activity in areas corresponding to the inclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry demonstrated abnormal accumulation of desmin and myotilin in fibers with inclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Given these pathological findings, he was diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003715'>myofibrillar myopathy</z:hpo> (MFM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because MFM is genetically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, its clinical manifestations are reported as variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While MFM patients are sometimes reported to develop serious conditions such as severe <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo>, which require a pacemaker or mechanical ventilator, our case only had mild distal dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0003690'>limb weakness</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003394'>muscle cramps</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our patient suggests that we must consider MFM as a differential diagnosis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
