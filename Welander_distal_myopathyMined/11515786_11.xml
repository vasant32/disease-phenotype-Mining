<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased lysosomal activity is associated with the formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo>, which are observed in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026848" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">muscle disorders</z:e> such as inclusion body <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBM</z:e>) and distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with rimmed vacuole (DMRV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 in biopsied muscle specimens from four cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBM</z:e> and two of DMRV, as well as six of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBM</z:e> and DMRV, immunohistochemistry showed accumulation of LAMPs in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> and the subsarcolemmal portion of the vacuolated fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivities of LAMPs in the vacuolated fibers were often associated with those of cathepsin D; however, cathepsin D was not expressed on some LAMP-positive fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, atrophic muscle fibers were sometimes positive for LAMPs expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings were more prominent in LAMP-2 than in LAMP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, LAMP-2 may play an important role in the increased protein degradation in diseased muscle fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increased expression of LAMPs in the vacuolated muscle fibers may be associated with the formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBM</z:e> and DMRV </plain></SENT>
