<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: Mutations in the gene encoding dysferlin cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> type 2B (LGMD2B), distal Miyoshi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (MM), and a rare form of distal anterior compartment <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study the correlations between clinical manifestations and muscle imaging changes we conducted a 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study in six German patients with primary dysferlinopathies defined by absence of dysferlin expression in muscle (MM, n = 3; LGMD2B, n = 2; hyperCKemia without clinical symptoms, n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with manifest <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> had widespread muscular pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In analogy to previous imaging studies, we confirmed an involvement of the anterior and posterior thigh compartments and a predominant involvement of posterior lower legs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, our whole-body MRI study further provided evidence of signal alterations in the glutei, erector spinae and shoulder girdle muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlation of clinical findings with imaging demonstrated the potential of MRI to detect subclinical muscle pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Whole-body 3.0-T MRI is a non-invasive method to demonstrate various degrees of skeletal muscle alterations and disease progression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, whole-body high-field MRI may serve as a helpful diagnostic tool in differentiating primary dysferlinopathies from other forms of LGMD and distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
