<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was first described in two families suffering from limb girdle muscle <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> type 1 (LGMD 1A), and later identified in a subset of dominant or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003715'>myofibrillar myopathy</z:hpo>, as well as in a family with spheroid body <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Disease phenotypes associated with MYOT mutations are clinically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and include pure LGMD forms as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report here on a 53-year-old male suffering from a unique clinical profile characterized by generalized symmetrical increase in muscle bulk leading to a Herculean appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>Muscle weakness</z:hpo> and stiffness in the lower extremities were the patient's main complaints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Muscle MRI showed extensive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_591'>fatty infiltration</z:mpath> in the thigh and leg muscles and a muscle biopsy showed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003715'>myofibrillar myopathy</z:hpo> with prominent protein aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gene sequencing revealed a Ser55Phe missense mutation in the myotilin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mutation was identified in his older brother, who presented a mild hypertrophic appearance and had a myopathic pattern in EMG, despite not presenting any of the complaints of the proband and having <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> muscle strength </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding, and his deceased father and paternal aunt's similar gait disorders, suggest that this is in fact a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> kindred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present observations further expand the spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with mutations in the myotilin gene </plain></SENT>
