<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two female patients with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (Miyoshi) are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination revealed marked <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and a low skin temperature of both lower legs, especially over the gastrocnemius muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens of the anterior tibial muscle exhibited myopathological features compatible with a dystrophic change and showed positive dystrophin reactions with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six antibodies used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Autonomic nerve studies in both patients, including laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF), component analysis of the cardiographic R-R interval and a sympathetic skin response (SSR) test, demonstrated marked abnormalities, such as sensitive vasoconstrictive responses, a suppressed peak of low frequency components and an absence of SSR, respectively, compared with findings in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sympathetic nerve blocking by means of epidural anesthesia produced clinical improvement and a marked decrease in the serum CK level in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the etiology of autonomic nerve disturbances in these cases remains to be elucidated, a positive immunoreactivity of nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) implies the possibility of some unknown sympathetic neurovascular disorder involving <z:mp ids='MP_0000749'>muscle degeneration</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
