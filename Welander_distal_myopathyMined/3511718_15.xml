<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Skeletal muscle obtained from a patient with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with rimmed vacuole formation (DMRV) was examined by a new direct labeled antibody enzyme method of immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abnormal increases of cathepsins B and H, capable of degrading the myofibrillar proteins, were demonstrated to be localized at the site of vacuoles and other intramyofibral portions and not to be associated with concomitant increases of their endogenous inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Autodigestion by these intramyofibral lysosomal proteinases may be of major importance in focal destruction of myofibers and formation of vacuoles, because no myofiber <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> with invasion of macrophages, overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> was seen in the muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings provide the first reasonable explanation of myofibral breakdown and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in DMRV, and should be helpful in further studies on the mechanism of myofibral breakdown in various vacuolar <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> of so far unknown pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
