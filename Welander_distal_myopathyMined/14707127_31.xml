<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a Japanese patient with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo>, we identified pathogenic mutations in the gene encoding the bifunctional enzyme <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16264">UDP-GlcNAc</z:chebi> 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase, which catalyzes the initial two steps in the biosynthesis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrated the relationship between the genetic mutations and enzymatic activities using an in vitro expression assay system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we also showed that the levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> in muscle and primary cultured cells from DMRV patients were reduced to 60-75% of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reactivities to lectins were also variable in some myofibers, suggesting that hyposialylation and abnormal glycosylation in muscles may contribute to the focal accumulations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003736'>autophagic vacuoles</z:hpo>, amyloid deposits, or both in patient muscle tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The addition of ManNAc and NeuAc to primary cultured cells normalized sialylation levels, thus demonstrating the therapeutic potential of these compounds for this disease </plain></SENT>
