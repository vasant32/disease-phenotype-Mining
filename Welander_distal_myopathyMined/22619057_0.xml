<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report on a German family presenting with a predominantly distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> primarily affecting anterior compartments of lower legs in childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proximal lower limb and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003749'>hip girdle weakness</z:hpo> developed later in early adulthood in the female index patient and likewise in her mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consecutive muscle biopsy findings were first attributed to a mild congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> and later on interpreted as neurogenic changes without clear signs of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Molecular genetic analysis was performed because of the clinical impression of a distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> combined with dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The heterozygous mutation c.349G&gt;A (p.D117N) in the ZASP gene could be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This mutation had been previously associated with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo>, isolated, dilated left ventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011664'>non-compaction cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (OMIM*605906.0007), which was not present in our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data show that this mutation can be associated with an isolated skeletal <z:mp ids='MP_0005369'>muscle phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Second, mutation analysis of the ZASP gene is suggested for distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> of any age, even in cases of uncharacteristic muscle biopsy findings on routine analysis </plain></SENT>
