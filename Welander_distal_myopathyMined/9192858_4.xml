<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genes for LGMD type 2B and Miyoshi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (a form of DM) have been mapped to essentially the same region on chromosome 2p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We described recently a large inbred family with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> in which the LGMD and the DM phenotypes were manifested in separate affected members, and we assigned the gene for this condition to the same locus as in LGMD2B and Miyoshi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we report extended haplotypes in this family generated from 15 markers located at the region of interest on chromosome 2p13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Key recombinants allowed us to reduce further the candidate region for this polymorphic condition and defined the loci D2S327 and D2S2111 as the most likely boundaries of the mutant gene </plain></SENT>
