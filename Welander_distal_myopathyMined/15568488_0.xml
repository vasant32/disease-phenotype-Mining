<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a 40-year-old man who noticed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003698'>difficulty in standing</z:hpo> on his tiptoe from approximately 36 years-old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He presented with selective calf <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> on flexion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase (CK) level slightly increased to 569IU/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Muscle computed tomography (CT) revealed selective gastrocnemius and soleus <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle atrophy</z:hpo> with fat tissue replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A biopsy of the left gastrocnemius muscle revealed a marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0003557'>variation in muscle fiber size</z:hpo> and some necrotic and regenerating fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis using an anti-dysferlin antibody showed a faint and irregular immunostaining of the muscle surface membrane and abnormal immunoreactive depositions in the cytoplasm, although <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> dysferlin content was detected by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sequence analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> exons of the dysferlin gene revealed no responsible mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The case had clinical and pathological findings similar to those of Miyoshi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present study indicates that there may be a secondary abonormality of dysferlin derived from some other factors in patients with clinical and pathological findings similar to those of Miyoshi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of dysferlin expression should be elucidated to obtain a conclusive pathogenetic mechanism underlying this disorder </plain></SENT>
