<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disorder is considered as the most common of the distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> but is almost only seen in Sweden and some parts of Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The finding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> in muscle biopsies from patients with moderate and severe symptoms constitutes one similarity with hereditary inclusion body <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (HIBM) sparing the quadriceps as described by Argov and Yarom [Argov Z, Yarom R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>J Neurol Sci 1984;64:33-43] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The question has been raised whether some of the different forms of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> might be allelic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In previous reports the gene defects for HIBM and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> hereditary distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> (DMRV) have been mapped to chromosome 9pl-q1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Finnish tibial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (TMD) that displays similar histopathological findings has recently been linked to chromosome 2q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the regions of interest with dispersed microsatellite markers in four well-described pedigrees, and this study now excludes the regions on chromosome 9pl-q1 and 2q from linkage to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WDM</z:e> both by haplotype analysis and linkage analysis with the MLINK program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WDM</z:e>, showing morphological similarities with HIBM, is clearly separated from the disorders mapped to chromosomes 9 and 2 on clinical and genetical grounds </plain></SENT>
