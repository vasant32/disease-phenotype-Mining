<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An unusual inherited progressive distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011463'>childhood onset</z:hpo> is described in two sisters from a consanguineous Asian family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Motor milestones were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but gait deteriorated slowly thereafter with development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001290'>generalized hypotonia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> particularly in the wrist extensors and hand muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsies obtained at the ages of 6 and 10 years respectively (Case 1) showed significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 6 years muscle <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and histochemical appearance were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> although type I fibres predominated (79%) and a substantial pool of 'undifferentiated' fibres (12%) was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By 10 years there was a significant reduction in type I fibres (-13%) and in 'undifferentiated' fibres (-10%) with a concomitant increase in type II fibres (+23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fibre size and shape were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at the age of 6 years but no further fibre growth was evident 4 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The older sister (Case 2, age 13 years) was similarly affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The possibility of this progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> being caused by loss of neural control at two separate stages of development is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The importance of performing sequential morphometric studies of muscle biopsies from patients with unusual childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> is emphasized </plain></SENT>
