<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, subcellular localization of GNE and the mechanism of muscular damage have not been clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A rabbit polyclonal antibody for GNE was prepared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was performed using anti-GNE and anti-nuclear protein antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blotting with subcellular fractionated proteins was performed to determine subcellular localization of GNE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sizes of myonuclei were quantified in muscle biopsies from patients with DMRV and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007354'>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</z:hpo> (ALS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In DMRV muscles, immunohistochemistry identified GNE in sarcoplasm and specifically in myonuclei and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> (RV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nuclear proteins were also found in RVs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry showed colocalization of GNE and emerin in C2C12 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Western blotting revealed the presence of GNE in nuclear fractions of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean size of myonuclei of DMRV was significantly larger than that of ALS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: GNE is present in myonuclei near nuclear membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that myonuclei are involved in RV formation in DMRV, and that mutant GNE in myonuclei seems to play some role in this process </plain></SENT>
