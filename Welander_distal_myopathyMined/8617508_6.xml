<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have mapped an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> form of LGMD (LGMD2B) to chromosome 2p13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two other conditions have been shown to map to this region or to the homologous region in mouse: a gene for a form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, Miyoshi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, shows linkage to the same markers on chromosome 2p as LGMD2B, and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> mouse mutation mnd2, in which there is <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapidly progressive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle atrophy</z:hpo>, has been mapped to mouse chromosome 6 to a region showing conserved synteny with human chromosome 2p12-p13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have assembled a 6-cM YAC contig spanning the LGMD2B locus and have mapped seven genes and 13 anonymous polymorphic microsatellites to it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using haplotype analysis in the linked families, we have narrowed our region of interest to a 0-cM interval between D2S2113 and D2S2112/D2S145, which does not overlap with the critical region for mnd2 in mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Use of these most closely linked markers will help to determine the relationship between LGMD2B and Miyoshi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>YACs selected from our contig will be the starting point for the cloning of the LGMD2B gene and thereby establish the biological basis for this form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and its relationship with the other <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
