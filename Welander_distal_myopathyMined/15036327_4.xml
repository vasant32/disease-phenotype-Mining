<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We recently described a new type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (MPD3) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms is around the age of 30 and the characteristic first symptoms include <z:hpo ids='HP_0002312'>clumsiness</z:hpo> of the hands and stumbling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The thenar and hypothenar muscles are involved at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The disease progressed to the intrinsic muscles of the hands, both anterior and posterior muscle compartments of the lower legs, the forearm muscles, and later to the proximal muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dystrophic changes with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> were observed in the muscle biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have performed a genome wide scan here in order to identify the MPD3 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, markers on two distinct chromosomal regions 8p22-q11 and 12q13-q22, provided significant evidence for linkage in this family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multipoint linkage analyses produced equal maximum multipoint LOD score of 3.01 for both chromosomal regions and haplotype analysis showed a specific haplotype segregating with the disease for both loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is thus impossible to distinguish between two loci without additional family material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two obvious regional candidate genes, encoding muscular proteins became subjects for sequence analyses, the gene for myosin light chain 1 slow-twitch muscle A on 12q13 and the muscle specific exons of ankyrin 1 on 8p11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No mutations were identified in the coding sequence </plain></SENT>
