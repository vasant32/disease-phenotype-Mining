<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite of the characteristic clinical features, the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FSHD</z:e> is sometimes difficult because clinical symptoms are extremely variable including facial sparing type, limb-girdle type, and distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FSHD</z:e> patients have a deletion in the subtelomeric region of chromosome 4q35 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FSHMD1A</z:e>), however the linkage analysis in some families suggested <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we identified 40 patients without a deletion in the 4q35 region (non-4q35del) among 200 Japanese patients who were clinically suspected to have FHSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> non-4q35del patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003547'>shoulder-girdle weakness</z:hpo> and 75% also had facial <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight patients showed clinical features that were indistinguishable from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FSHD</z:e>, but two of them had Becker <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FSHD</z:e> is clinically, and most likely genetically, as well, variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> can also mimic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FSHD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
