<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We directly screened calpain-3 (CAPN3) in 18 Chinese Han subjects who exhibited severely reduced or completely absent calpain-3 expression, as determined by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We subsequently analyzed genotype/phenotype correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen patients (94.4%) were identified who had at least 1 causative mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 18 mutations were distributed along the entire gene, and 11 of the mutations were novel, including 4 missense mutations, 5 deletions, and 2 splicing mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The phenotypes of these Chinese LGMD2A patients varied from severe LGMD to distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, and even asymptomatic hyper-CK-emia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No evidential correlation was found between the genotypes and phenotypes of the patients assessed in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis is still a useful diagnostic method when genetic analysis is unavailable </plain></SENT>
