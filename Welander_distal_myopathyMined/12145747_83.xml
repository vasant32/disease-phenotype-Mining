<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The linked region includes the giant TTN gene, which encodes the central sarcomeric protein, titin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown a secondary calpain-3 defect to be associated with TMD, which further underscored that titin is the candidate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We now report the first mutations in TTN to cause a human skeletal-muscle disease, TMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Mex6, the last exon of TTN, a unique 11-bp deletion/insertion mutation, changing four amino acid residues, completely cosegregated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tested 81 Finnish patients with TMD in 12 unrelated families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mutation was not found in 216 Finnish control samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a French family with TMD, a<z:chebi fb="3" ids="30006"> Leu--</z:chebi>&gt;Pro mutation at position 293,357 in Mex6 was discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mex6 is adjacent to the known calpain-3 binding site Mex5 of M-line titin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis using two exon-specific antibodies directed to the M-line region of titin demonstrated the specific loss of carboxy-terminal titin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> in the TMD muscle samples that we studied, thus implicating a functional defect of the M-line titin in the genesis of the TMD disease phenotype </plain></SENT>
