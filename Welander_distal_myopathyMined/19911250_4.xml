<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here the first Italian cases of TTN mutated titinopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The proband, a 60 year-old female, had the first muscular signs at the age of 59 years, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002355'>difficulty in walking</z:hpo> and right <z:hpo ids='HP_0003377'>foot drop</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Muscle imaging showed selective fatty degenerative change in the anterior compartment of leg muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Her 67 year-old brother, started to show <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo>, pain at lower limbs and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of calf muscles at the age of 66 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their mother began to show <z:hpo ids='HP_0003377'>foot drop</z:hpo> and impaired walking from the age of 60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other relatives are reported to be affected in a similar way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because the phenotype appeared compatible with TMD, we analyzed the TTN gene in the DNA of the proband and we identified a heterozygous mutation 293326A&gt;C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This mutation is also present in the brother and in the other affected individuals of the same family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mutation predicts a His33378Pro change located next to the previously known Belgian TMD mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mutation was not found in 100 Italian control DNA samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Then, since the introduction of a proline in the last domain of titin was previously known to cause TMD in French families, we can conclude that this missense mutation is the obvious pathogenetic mutation in the affected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No other disease causing mutations in the TTN gene have so far been reported in the Italian population </plain></SENT>
