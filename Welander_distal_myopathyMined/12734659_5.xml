<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The protein is normally expressed at the skeletal muscle level and absent or reduced in affected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We selected a clinically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> population of Italian myopathic patients with clinical evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> and/or hyperCKemia, EMG myopathic pattern, and no alterations of the dystrophin-sarcoglycan complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Calpain, merosin, emerin and caveolin were also tested and found <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dysferlin immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses allowed us to identify six patients with dysferlin deficiency: one with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, four with limb girdle <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> and one with hyperCKemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was found in any of the six muscle specimens, although expression of the pro-apoptotic Fas antigen was mildly increased in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory reactions were present in two of the six cases, but we found no evidence of immune-mediated processes </plain></SENT>
