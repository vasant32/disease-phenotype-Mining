<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Through whole exome sequencing, we identified a novel p.Ala1439Pro MYH7 mutation in a Korean LDM family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This missense mutation is located in more N-terminal than any reported rod domain LDM mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the early stage of disease, the present patients showed similar clinical patterns to the previously described patients of LDM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in the later stage, fatty replacement and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of paraspinal or proximal leg muscles was more severely marked than lower leg muscles, and asymmetric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophies</z:mpath> were observed in trapezius, subscapularis and adductor magnus muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> like LDM showed marked and predominant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_591'>fatty infiltrations</z:mpath> in paraspinal or proximal leg muscles with marked asymmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations expand the clinical spectrum of LDM with the MYH7 mutation </plain></SENT>
