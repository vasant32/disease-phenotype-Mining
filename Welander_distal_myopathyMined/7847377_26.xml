<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied a family segregating a form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (MIM 160500) and containing nine living affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> in this family is closest in clinical phenotype to that first described by Gowers in 1902 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A search for linkage was conducted using microsatellite, VNTR, and RFLP markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In total, 92 markers on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 22 autosomes were run </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Positive linkage was obtained with 14 of 15 markers tested on chromosome 14, with little indication of linkage elsewhere in the genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Maximum two-point LOD scores of 2.60 at recombination fraction .00 were obtained for the markers MYH7 and D14S64--the family structure precludes a two-point LOD score &gt; or = 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recombinations with D14S72 and D14S49 indicate that this distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> locus, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD1</z:e>, should lie between these markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A multipoint analysis assuming 100% penetrance and using the markers D14S72, D14S50, MYH7, D14S64, D14S54, and D14S49 gave a LOD score of exactly 3 at MYH7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis at a penetrance of 80% gave a LOD score of 2.8 at this marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This probable localization of a gene for distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD1</z:e>, on chromosome 14 should allow other investigators studying distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> families to test this region for linkage in other types of the disease, to confirm linkage or to demonstrate the likely <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
