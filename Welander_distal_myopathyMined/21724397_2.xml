<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported a nonspecific distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> caused by homozygous missense mutations in the nebulin gene in six Finnish patients from four different families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we describe three non-Finnish patients in two unrelated families with distal nemaline <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> caused by four different compound heterozygous nebulin mutations, only one of which is a missense mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of the mutations has previously been identified in one family with the severe form of nemaline <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that nemaline <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> and distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> caused by nebulin mutations form a clinical and histological continuum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nemaline <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with an early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> predominantly distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
