<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the results of a longitudinal study involving MRI and clinical follow-up in nine siblings from four families with Miyoshi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (MM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> individuals carried pathogenic dysferlin gene (DYSF) mutations with six of them suffering from symptomatic disease and three being presymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In presymptomatic subjects, MRI was sensitive to detect alterations in muscle tissue years before disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first MRI alteration to disclose was evidence for myoedema in dorsal compartment muscles of the legs followed by fatty degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, MRI changes anticipated the topography of subsequent clinical muscle involvement and progressed from distal to proximal dorsal leg muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In symptomatic subjects, MRI changes reflected the pattern and severity of clinical muscle involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRI evidence, however, suggests that muscle involvement is much more prominent in early disease stages than clinically seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up up to 8 years made evident that MM <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> occurs at a mean age of 18.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most prominent initial deficit was impaired tiptoe gait due to muscle plantarflexor dysfunction followed by impaired dorsiflexor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dorsal compartments were predominantly affected not only in distal but also in proximal leg muscles, and a more <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> was noticed during the early phase of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that MRI is a helpful diagnostic tool for an early diagnosis of MM and other distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> since it provides sensitive and topographic information about initial and even preclinical muscle involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is of particular relevance in Miyoshi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> because distinct CK elevation is present long before its clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and often misdiagnosed as "idiopathic" </plain></SENT>
