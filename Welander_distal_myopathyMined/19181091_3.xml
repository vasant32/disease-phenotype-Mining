<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is a determinant of thin filament length, Z-disk structure and fiber contractility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The nebulin gene contains four regions of alternative splicing, providing a wealth of different isoforms of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The precise function of these numerous isoforms in various types of muscle tissue remains to be elucidated, as does their role in the maintenance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> muscle strength and activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Understanding these basic mechanisms is a prerequisite for the development of specific therapies for the disorders caused by mutations in the nebulin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such mutations are the main cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> nemaline (rod) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, especially of the typical form of this congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further known disorders caused by nebulin mutations are several other subcategories of recessively inherited nemaline <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> and a novel distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> caused byhomozygous missense mutations in the nebulin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because of the giant size of the gene, molecular genetic testing methods are difficult to design for routine diagnostic use </plain></SENT>
