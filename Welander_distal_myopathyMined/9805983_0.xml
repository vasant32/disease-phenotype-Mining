<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>UEA I binding to muscle fibers was also observed in a small number of biopsies with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009071'>inflammatory myopathy</z:hpo>, but not in other diseases, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>neurogenic muscular atrophies</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to elucidate the relationship between this UEA I binding, rimmed vacuole formation and active autophagocytosis, we examined the UEA I binding fibers in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> which frequently showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017921" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="AMD">acid maltase deficiency</z:e>, oculo-pharyngo-distal type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> and oculopharyngeal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No UEA I lectin labeling fiber was observed in the diseases examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then studied UEA I binding behavior on 70 biopsies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009071'>inflammatory myopathy</z:hpo> to characterize the clinical features of UEA I binding positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>UEA I binding fibers were observed in 3 of 28 patients (11%) with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748408,C0009326" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">collagen diseases</z:e>, 11 of 36 (31%) without these disorders, and 2 of 6 (33%) with inclusion body <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no common clinical histories, complications or laboratory findings among the UEA I binding positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a common process may exist between the muscle fiber degeneration in DMRV and subgroups of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009071'>inflammatory myopathy</z:hpo> patients, but the basic mechanism remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
