<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The authors carried out clinical, histopathologic, immunocytochemical, electrophysiologic, and imaging investigations and molecular genetic analysis in seven patients with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> belonging to a Finnish family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The disease showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> ranged from 32 to 45 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first symptoms for referral were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002312'>clumsiness</z:hpo> with the hands and frequent stumbling from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003376'>steppage gait</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>Muscle weakness</z:hpo> was characterized by early involvement of the small muscles of the hands, gluteus medium, and both anterior and posterior muscle compartments of the legs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The disease progressed to involve other intrinsic muscles of the hands, as well as the forearm muscles, triceps and infraspinatus, and proximal lower limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Asymmetry of muscle involvement was common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EMG showed myopathic features, serum CK was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or slightly elevated, and muscle biopsy showed many <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> and dystrophic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of linkage to Welander distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> or tibial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These patients may have a distinct distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide scan is undertaken in order to identify the disease locus </plain></SENT>
