<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The author described one patient showing characteristic MM phenotype with deficiency of dysferlin on immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Direct DNA sequencing of whole exons of DYSF gene revealed one homozygous missense mutation (G1165C) on exon 12, which let to an amino acid substitution from the glutamic acid to glutamine at the 389 of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> sequence in this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is the first reported case of MM confirmed by immunohistochemical and genetic analyses in Korea </plain></SENT>
