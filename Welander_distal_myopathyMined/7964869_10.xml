<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 56-year-old female and her 34-year-old daughter presented with a predominantly distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> affecting the peroneal and calf muscles, neck flexors and hand muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both patients and two other daughters had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, three requiring the insertion of cardiac pacemakers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Skeletal muscle biopsies revealed a complex myopathic process with granular degeneration, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> and eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructurally, the inclusions were composed of electron dense granular material and filaments forming linear masses beneath the sarcolemma and rounded masses within the cytoplasm of the fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry revealed labelling of the inclusions for desmin, dystrophin and vimentin, but not for alpha-actinin, spectrin, utrophin or myosin heavy chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This family shows a hereditary distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with some features in common with previously-reported cases in which biopsies showed cytoplasmic inclusion bodies containing desmin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This group of diseases is clinically and pathologically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the present cases, the accumulation of cytoplasmic filaments may reflect a generalised disturbance of filamentous protein metabolism rather than a specific disorder of desmin </plain></SENT>
