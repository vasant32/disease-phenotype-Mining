<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report the identification of the mdm mutation as a complex rearrangement that includes a deletion and a LINE insertion in the titin (Ttn) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutant allele-specific splicing results in the deletion of 83 amino acids from the N2A region of TTN, a domain thought to bind calpain-3 (CAPN3) the product of the human <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> type 2A (LGMD2A) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Ttn(mdm) mutant mouse may serve as a model for human tibial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, which maps to the TTN locus at 2q31 and shows a secondary reduction of CAPN3 similar to that observed in mdm skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is the first demonstration that a mutation in Ttn is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and provides a novel animal model to test for functional interactions between TTN and CAPN3 </plain></SENT>
