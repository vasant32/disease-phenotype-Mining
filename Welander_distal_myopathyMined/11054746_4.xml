<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Investigators have speculated that the degenerative process in distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> (DMRV) mainly involves the lysosomal system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate possible protein abnormalities related to intracellular lysosomal proteolytic pathways in DMRV-affected muscles, we performed immunohistochemical analyses of certain proteins in muscle biopsy specimens obtained from patients with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular diseases</z:e>, including DMRV, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085655" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polymyositis</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007354'>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</z:hpo>, and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human muscles specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, most muscle fibers in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control specimens showed little or no reaction for clathrin and alpha- and gamma-subunits of adaptin-constituted adaptin proteins (AP)-1 and AP-2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abnormal increases in these proteins were demonstrated mainly in the cytoplasm of atrophic fibers or in necrotic fibers in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diseased specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Particularly in DMRV-affected muscles, alpha- and gamma-adaptins were often observed inside or on the rims of vacuoles and in the cytoplasm of vacuolated fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abnormal increases in Golgi-zone protein were also demonstrated in DMRV muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rims of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> were negative for kinectin, an endoplasmic reticulum-binding protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Positive staining for both proteins, however, was sometimes seen inside the vacuoles in DMRV-affected fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest increased endocytosis at the plasma membrane as well as secretion involving transport from the trans-Golgi network of the Golgi apparatus in DMRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Accumulation of various lysosome-related proteins within the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> indicates at least some of these vacuoles may be autolysosomes </plain></SENT>
