<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPDs</z:e>) are genetically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic causes within this subgroup of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026848" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">muscle disorders</z:e> remain largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> linked to chromosome 14q11-q13 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD1</z:e>) is rare, and to our knowledge, only one family with definitive linkage has been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the results of clinical and genetic analysis of the second kindred with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD1</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have identified a family with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> segregating in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We tested linkage to previously identified genetic loci on chromosomes 2p, 2q, and 14q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The coding sequence of PABP2 (the polyadenylate-binding protein 2 gene) was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Every affected individual had selective <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of foot extensors, with the average age of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> at 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Some patients also had proximal <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, but none had signs of finger or hand extensor muscle involvement, even in advanced stages of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two typically affected individuals had signs of idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Genetic analysis detected a tight linkage to chromosome 14q11-q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Recombination at the telomeric end of the 14q11-q13 locus was found in an unaffected individual who was not considered to be at risk, potentially reducing the locus interval by 2 centimorgans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No mutations in the PABP2 gene were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, our described family is only the second known kindred with a chromosome 14-linked <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> in whom the linkage has been unequivocally established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We did not detect signs of involvement of hand or finger extensors and neck muscles, seen in the original family with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD1</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The degree and frequency of proximal <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> seem to be more prominent than in other patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD1</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis suggests that the gene is located between polymorphic microsatellite markers D14S283 and D14S1034 on chromosome 14q11-q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in some affected individuals may help in the identification of candidate genes </plain></SENT>
