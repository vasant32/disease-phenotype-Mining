<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most reported cases were large inbred kindreds whose members demonstrated both MM and LGMD2B phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical, neurophysiological, histopathological, and genetic features in 4 patients with MM from 2 unrelated Chinese families demonstrating linkage to the dysferlin locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were characterized by early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo>, preferential <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of calf muscles, marked elevation of serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase levels, and absence of dysferlin staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging showed fatty and fibrotic tissue signals in the affected muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genetic analysis revealed novel compound heterozygous mutations, 1310+1G to A and GGG to GTC transition at nucleotide 1650 (G426V ) in one family and another novel compound heterozygous mutation, a deletion of C at nucleotide 477 and a CCG to CTG transition at nucleotide 6576 (P2068L), in the other family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Miyoshi distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> in these 2 Chinese families demonstrated a homogenous phenotype and compound heterozygous mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 4 mutations, 3 were novel mutations that, to our knowledge, have not been reported previously </plain></SENT>
