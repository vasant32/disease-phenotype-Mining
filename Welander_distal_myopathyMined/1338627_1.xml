<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A case of 55-year-old male with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with rimmed vacuole formation is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He first noticed dragging of his legs at the age of forty-three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two years later, he was evaluated to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle wasting</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> in lower legs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In another ten years, he became unable to stand or walk unaided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On physical examination, proximal limb muscles were more severely affected than distal limb muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Notably, muscle strength of the quadriceps femoris muscles were weak (MRC Scale 3/5), compared to hamstrings, tibialis anterior muscle and gastrocnemius muscle (4/5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase, electromyography, nerve conduction velocities were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> compatible with this diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A computed tomography of the musculoskeletal system was consistent with physical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsy revealed many fibers with typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> (approximately 6% of fibers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, small amount of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003200'>ragged-red fibers</z:hpo> (0.5%) was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histochemical reaction showed a focal deficiency of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> oxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This case suggests that during the longstanding course of the illness, proximal limb muscles may be more severely affected, and quadriceps femoris muscle may be predominantly involved </plain></SENT>
