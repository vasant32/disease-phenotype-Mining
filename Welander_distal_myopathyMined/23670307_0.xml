<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Since the initial description in 2010 of anoctamin 5 deficiency as a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, a handful of papers have described this disease in cases of mixed populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the first large regional study and present data on new aspects of prevalence, muscular and cardiac phenotypic characteristics, and muscle protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients in our neuromuscular unit with genetically unclassified, recessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (LGMD2), Miyoshi-type distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (MMD) or persistent asymptomatic hyperCK-emia (PACK) were assessed for mutations in the ANO5 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genetically confirmed patients were evaluated with muscular and cardiopulmonary examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 40 unclassified patients (28 LGMD2, 5 MMD, 7 PACK), 20 were homozygous or compound heterozygous for ANO5 mutations, (13 LGMD2, 5 MMD, 2 PACK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of ANO5 deficiency in Denmark was estimated at 1:100.000 and ANO5 mutations caused 11 % of our total cohort of LGMD2 cases making it the second most common LGMD2 etiology in Denmark </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight patients complained of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> and 3 dated symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardiac examinations revealed increased frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four novel putative pathogenic mutations were discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Total prevalence and distribution of phenotypes of ANO5 disease in a representative regional cohort are described for the first time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A high prevalence of ANO5 deficiency was found among patients with unclassified LGMD2 (46 %) and MMD (100 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The high incidence of reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> is a new phenotypic feature not previously reported, and cardiac investigations revealed that ANO5-patients may have an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
