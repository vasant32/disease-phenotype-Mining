<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The phenotypes are: (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> 1C (LGMD1C) characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> usually in the first decade, mild-to-moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0003701'>proximal muscle weakness</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0008981'>calf hypertrophy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003391'>positive Gower sign</z:hpo>, and variable <z:hpo ids='HP_0003394'>muscle cramps</z:hpo> after exercise; (2) isolated hyperCKemia (i.e., elevated serum concentration of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase (CK) in the absence of signs of muscle disease) (HCK); (3) rippling muscle disease (RMD), characterized by signs of increased muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo>, such as percussion-induced rapid contraction (PIRC), percussion-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003719'>muscle mounding</z:hpo> (PIMM), and/or electrically silent muscle contractions (rippling muscle); (4) distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (DM), observed in one individual only; and (5) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM), without skeletal muscle manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:   CAV3, which encodes caveolin-3, a muscle-specific membrane protein and the principal component of caveolae membrane in muscle cells in vivo, is the only gene known to be associated with caveolinopathies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis identifies mutations in more than 99% of affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MANAGEMENT:  Treatment of manifestations: aggressive supportive care to preserve muscle function, maximize functional ability and treat complications, especially in those with the LGMD phenotype; weight control to avoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>; physical therapy and stretching exercises to promote mobility and prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo>; use of mechanical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> such as canes, walkers, orthotics, and wheelchairs as needed to help ambulation and mobility; social and emotional support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prevention of secondary complications: In individuals with isolated HCK, special precautions during surgical procedures and anesthesia because of possible risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002047'>malignant hyperthermia</z:hpo> (MH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surveillance: periodic monitoring of spine, respiratory function, cardiac function, mobility, and muscle function based on individual needs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GENETIC COUNSELING:  Most caveolinopathies are inherited in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> manner; they may also be inherited in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>Autosomal dominant</z:hpo> caveolinopathies: Most affected individuals have an affected parent; the proportion of cases caused by de novo mutations is unknown, but probably rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Each child of an individual with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> caveolinopathy has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>Autosomal recessive</z:hpo> caveolinopathies: The parents of an affected child are obligate heterozygotes (carriers) and therefore carry one mutant allele; heterozygotes can be asymptomatic or can display modest elevation of serum CK concentration and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0008981'>calf hypertrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At conception, each sib of an individual with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> caveolinopathy has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the disease-causing mutation(s) has/have been identified in an affected family member </plain></SENT>
