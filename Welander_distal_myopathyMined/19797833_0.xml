<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On muscle CT, the red muscles of the soleus, anterior tibial and paraspinal muscles, where type 1 fiber is known to predominate, were almost totally replaced by fat tissue while quadriceps femoris, gastrocnemius and upper extremity muscles were relatively spared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quadriceps muscle biopsy revealed multi-minicores in addition to occasional larger cores, in about 70% of the type 1 fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A novel heterozygous nucleotide change c.5869T &gt; A (p.S1957T) was identified in RYR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although pathogenicity was not confirmed, this nucleotide change was absent in 100 control DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We did not find a mutation in either multi-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">minicore disease</z:e>-associated gene, SEPN1, or major distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>-related genes, including GNE, ZASP, MYOT, exons 32-36 of MYH7, and the last exon of TTN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is probably a unique form of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> characterized by the presence of multi-minicores with preferential involvement of type 1 fibers </plain></SENT>
