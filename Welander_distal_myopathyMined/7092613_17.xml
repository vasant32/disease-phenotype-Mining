<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most striking change seen by light microscopy was the appearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These were presumed to be autophagic, because they were found by electron microscopy to contain membranous lamellar structures and other heterogenous materials enclosed by a limiting membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, lysosomal activity was markedly increased in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 6% to 22% of affected muscle fibers there were acid phosphatase-positive granules deep in the sarcoplasm, whereas control muscles had no such granules </plain></SENT>
