<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Acid phosphatase activity was also increased in and around these vacuoles, but the vacuoles were negative for other histochemical stainings such as with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi>-tetrazolium reductase, ATPase and phosphorylase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> deaminase is bound to membranous components in addition to myosin in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
