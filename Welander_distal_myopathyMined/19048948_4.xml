<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We reported a 23-year-old woman with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> and highly <z:hpo ids='HP_0003236'>elevated serum creatine kinase</z:hpo> (CK) caused by calpainopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> was not evident, a muscle CT scan revealed replacement by adipose tissue in the medial head of the gastrocnemius </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The gluteus maximus and biceps femoris were also affected to a lesser degree, but the lateral head of the gastrocnemius was preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A histological study of a biopsied specimen of the biceps brachii revealed obvious variation in fiber size and a few necrotic or regenerating fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>Rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> or lobulated fibers were absent in vacuoles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the clinical features suggested Miyoshi's distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, gene analysis of calpain 3 revealed a c.802-9G &gt; A mutation in intron 5 and a c.1319G &gt; A (p.Arg440Gln) in exon 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mini-multiplex Western Blotting (MMW) of the patient's muscle showed no band in calpain 3 (p94) and calpain 3 30 kDa fragments and immunoblotting did not reveal any dysferlin abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Calpainopathy should be also considered in patients with clinical manifestations of Miyoshi distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
