<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mutations in the valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene are known to cause inclusion body <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029401" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Paget's disease of bone</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (IBMPFD) and familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0007354'>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</z:hpo> (ALS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite an increasing number of clinical reports, only one Asian family with IBMPFD has been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To characterize patients with VCP mutations, we screened a total of 152 unrelated Asian families who were suspected to have rimmed vacuolar <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified VCP mutations in seven patients from six unrelated Asian families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five different missense mutations were found, including a novel p.Ala439Pro substitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle wasting</z:hpo> with variable involvement of axial, proximal, and distal muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of seven patients were suggested to have mild brain involvement including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo>, and only one showed radiological findings indicating a change in bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Findings from skeletal muscle indicated mixed neurogenic and myogenic changes, fibers with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo>, and the presence of cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These inclusions were immunopositive for VCP, ubiquitin, transactivation response DNA-binding protein 43, and also <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), of which function is regulated by VCP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Evidence of early nuclear and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> damage was also characteristic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: â€‚ Valosin-containing protein mutations are not rare in Asian patients, and gene analysis should be considered for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> rimmed vacuolar <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with neurogenic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A wide variety of central and peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system symptoms coupled with rare bone abnormalities may complicate diagnosis </plain></SENT>
