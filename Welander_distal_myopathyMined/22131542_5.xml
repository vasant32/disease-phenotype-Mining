<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the detailed clinical findings and underlying genetic defect in 3 presumably related Bulgarian families displaying dominantly transmitted <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with upper limb predominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed neurologic, electrophysiologic, radiologic, and histopathologic analyses of 13 patients and 13 at-risk but asymptomatic individuals from 3 generations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide parametric linkage analysis was followed by bidirectional sequencing of the filamin C (FLNC) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We characterized the identified nonsense mutation at cDNA and protein level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Based on clinical findings, no known <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> subtype was implicated in our distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Light microscopic analysis of affected muscle tissue showed no specific hallmarks; however, the electron microscopy revealed changes compatible with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003715'>myofibrillar myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Linkage studies delineated a 9.76 Mb region on chromosome 7q22.1-q35 containing filamin C (FLNC), a gene previously associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003715'>myofibrillar myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutation analysis revealed a novel c.5160delC frameshift deletion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients of the 3 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mutation results in a premature stop codon (p.Phe1720LeufsX63) that triggers nonsense-mediated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> decay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FLNC transcript levels were reduced in muscle and lymphoblast cells from affected subjects and partial loss of FLNC in muscle tissue was confirmed by protein analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The FLNC mutation that we identified is distinct in terms of the associated phenotype, muscle <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, and underlying molecular mechanism, thus extending the currently recognized clinical and genetic spectrum of filaminopathies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that filamin C is a dosage-sensitive gene and that FLNC haploinsufficiency can cause a specific type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> in humans </plain></SENT>
