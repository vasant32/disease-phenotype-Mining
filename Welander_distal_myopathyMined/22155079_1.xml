<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the MYH7 gene encoding for the β-myosin heavy chain are the underlying genetic cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD1</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, their pathogenic mechanisms are currently unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we measure the biological effects of the R1500P and L1706P <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD1</z:e> mutations in different cellular systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that, while the two mutations inhibit myosin self-assembly in non-muscle cells, they do not prevent incorporation of the mutant myosin into sarcomeres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, we find that the L1706P mutation affects proper antiparallel myosin association by accumulating in the bare zone of the sarcomere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay shows that the α-helix containing the R1500P mutation folds into homodimeric (mutant/mutant) and heterodimeric [mutant/<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (WT)] myosin molecules that are competent for sarcomere incorporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both mutations also form aggregates consisting of cytoplasmic vacuoles surrounding paracrystalline arrays and amorphous rod-like inclusions that sequester WT myosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Myosin aggregates were also detected in transgenic nematodes expressing the R1500P mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By showing that the two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD1</z:e> mutations can have dominant effects on distinct components of the contractile apparatus, our data provide the first insights into the pathogenesis of the disease </plain></SENT>
