<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiology of DMRV has not been clarified yet, although the responsible gene was identified as that encoding <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase involved in the biosynthesis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To identify defective carbohydrate moieties of muscular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> from DMRV patients, frozen skeletal muscle sections from seven patients with DMRV, as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathological controls, were treated with or without sialidase or N-glycosidase F followed by lectin staining and lectin blotting analysis </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that Arachis hypogaea agglutinin (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi>) lectin reacted strongly with sarcolemmal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> in the DMRV patients but not with those in control subjects </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results show that impaired sialyl O-glycan formation in muscular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi>, including alpha-dystroglycan, occurs in DMRV </plain></SENT>
