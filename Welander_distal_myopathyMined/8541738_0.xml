<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper reports two siblings with DMRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each showed a different pattern of disease progression, one being slowly and the other <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapidly progressive</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both patients' initial symptoms appeared in early adulthood, manifesting as muscular <z:mp ids='MP_0005150'>wasting</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of the legs, especially in the distal muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Severe generalized involvement of skeletal muscles, with sparing of the facial, extraocular, bulbar, intercostal and diaphragm muscles was recognized in the advanced stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The striking finding in their muscle biopsy specimens was the presence of "rimmed" vacuoles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging showed more severe involvement of the anterior compartment muscles of the lower legs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DMRV is thought to be inherited as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> trait and is distinguishable from other types of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> on the basis of clinical and pathologic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The literature on the subject is reviewed with emphasis on the differences between distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026848" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myopathic syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
