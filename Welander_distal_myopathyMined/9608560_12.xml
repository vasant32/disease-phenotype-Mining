<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Desminopathies form a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> characterised by pathological aggregations of desmin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a family, where mother and daughter presented with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002460'>distal muscular weakness</z:hpo>, with non-homogeneous focal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> on computed tomography scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mother developed a severe global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018801" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart insufficiency</z:e> necessitating a heart transplantation at 56 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Skeletal muscle biopsies were characterised by inclusion bodies strongly expressing desmin and alpha B-crystallin, with a predominantly subsarcolemmal localisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructurally most inclusions corresponded to non-membrane bound granulo-filamentous material with disruption of myofibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An immunoblot showed a hyperintense desmin band at 53 kDa and a second band at 49 kDa, the latter being absent in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cardiac muscle of the explanted heart showed very similar inclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These cases illustrate that in this distinct subtype of desminopathies the cardiac muscle alterations are comparable with those observed in skeletal muscle, and suggest the possibility of a primary desmin pathology </plain></SENT>
