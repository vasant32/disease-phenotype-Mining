<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disorder is considered a model disease for hereditary distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> and is almost only seen in Sweden and some parts of Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A genomewide screening has been performed in initially two Swedish families with 400 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report here that the disease is linked to chromosome 2p13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven additional nonrelated families have subsequently been mapped to the same area where a maximum two-point LOD score of 17.97 was obtained with the marker D2S2113 at 0.0 recombination fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The region has been restricted by recombinations and the finding of a common shared haplotype through <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> analyzed families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This restricts the gene locus region to 2.4 cM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings provide evidence for the involvement of a single locus for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WDM</z:e> region overlaps with the linkage region for Miyoshi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> 2B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The dysferlin gene responsible for these disorders is considered a primary candidate gene for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
