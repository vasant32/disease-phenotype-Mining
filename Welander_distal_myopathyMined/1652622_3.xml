<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Slight <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of the extensors of the fingers and hands was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nine patients, and of the dorsiflexors of the feet in seven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152027" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory disturbance</z:e> most prominent for temperature which agrees with earlier observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EMG changes in TA and extensor digitorum communis (<z:chebi fb="107" ids="27789">EDC</z:chebi>) muscles were of myopathic type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Slight abnormalities compatible with either <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> or early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> were found in one muscle biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that a neurogenic lesion affecting at least the peripheral sensory system is present at an early stage of Welander's distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> and that the neurogenic lesion might precede the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathic changes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
