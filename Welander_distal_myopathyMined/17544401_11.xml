<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have determined crystal structures of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> and S581L-mutant human GlyRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The S581L mutation is approximately 50A from the active site, and yet gives reduced aminoacylation activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall structures of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> and S581L-GlyRS, including the active site, are very similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, residues 567-575 of the anticodon-binding domain shift position and in turn could indirectly affect glycine binding via the tRNA or alternatively inhibit conformational changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reduced enzyme activity may underlie <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp>, although a dominant-negative effect is more likely in this <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> disorder </plain></SENT>
