<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, disease-causing defects were not known until recently, when this central sarcomeric protein was associated with human skeletal tibial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (TMD/LGMD2J), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several mutations in different parts of titin have now been identified and more are expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous mouse and zebrafish mutants have also been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experimental knock-outs are not viable, even in cases where just a c-terminal part of the gene was silenced, telling something of the basic importance of titin for life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this article we review the current known structure and functions of this elementary molecule with some emphasis on the only defects so far known to cause human skeletal muscle disease, mutations in the c-terminal M-line part of titin </plain></SENT>
