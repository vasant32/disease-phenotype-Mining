<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine whether tau protein found in muscle fibers with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> and in regenerating fibers was phosphorylated, we examined eight muscle biopsy samples containing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> (from five patients with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with rimmed vacuole formation and three patients with inclusion body <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo>) and three muscle biopsy samples from patients with Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> containing numerous regenerating fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although both rimmed vacuolated and regenerating fibers had increased immunoreactivity against tubulin and tau protein, tau protein in the former was more highly phosphorylated than that in the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While very few microtubules in muscle fibers with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> were recognizable by electron microscopy, regenerating fibers, especially immature ones, contained numerous microtubules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since tau protein found in vacuolated fibers is hyperphosphorylated, it can be considered to have reduced ability to bind tubulin molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the tau protein cannot stabilize microtubules, resulting in their depolymerization even in the presence of tubulin molecules </plain></SENT>
