<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, mutations in the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) gene have been identified as the genetic basis of DMRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the mutation spectrum of the GNE gene in Korean patients with DMRV, we performed clinical and genetic analysis of nine unrelated patients suspected to have DMRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing analysis revealed that eight out of nine patients (88.9%) were either homozygous or compound heterozygous for GNE gene mutations, including three known (C13S, R129Q, and V572L) and two novel mutations (M29T and A591T) [corrected] The allelic frequencies of the V572L and C13S mutations were 68.8% (11/16) and 12.5% (2/16), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that screening for GNE gene mutations in patients suspected to have DMRV would be helpful for molecular diagnosis of DMRV in the Korean population </plain></SENT>
