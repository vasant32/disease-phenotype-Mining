<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 24 Dutch patients with Miyoshi-type distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and focused on its clinical expression and natural history, muscle CT-scans and muscle biopsy findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study shows that Miyoshi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive disorder</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The disease starts with <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the calves and progressively involves the proximal leg and hip muscles and, in a later stage the shoulder and upper arm muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 10 years disease duration, one-third of the patients are dependent on wheelchairs for out-of-door transportation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disease progression is related to disease duration and not to early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>Onset</z:hpo> may be at any age and is asymmetrical in roughly half of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four cases had been initially diagnosed as idiopathic hyper-CK-aemia </plain></SENT>
