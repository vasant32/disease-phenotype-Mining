<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate the variability of clinical and morphological presentation and the spectrum of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">Glucosamine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>)-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) mutations in Chinese DMRV patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 37 patients with DMRV in <z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi> General Hospital from 1986 to 2011, and further conducted a review of 16 reported Chinese DMRV patients from other hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We systematically analyzed the clinical, muscle morphological features and GNE gene mutation status of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> DMRV patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 53 DMRV patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen cases had family history and other 39 cases were <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifteen cases showed atypical pathological presentation as mononuclear cell invasion into necrotic or non-necrotic muscle fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rare initial symptom, earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> and more dysmorphic presentations were shown in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighteen mutations in GNE gene were identified. c.317T&gt;C (p.I106T) was a novel GNE gene mutation. c.1892C&gt;T (p.A631V), c.527A&gt;T (p.D176V) and c.1523T&gt;C (p.L508S) were the common GNE mutations in Chinese DMRV patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The clinical, pathological and genetic characteristics of DMRV are distinct in Chinese patients </plain></SENT>
