<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus far, seven types of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> have been linked to four chromosome loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recently examined four affected members from three generations of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> kindred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A muscle biopsy was performed on the index case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Muscle histopathology showed non-specific myopathic findings including <z:hpo ids='HP_0003557'>increased variation in fiber size</z:hpo> and increased internalized nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No abnormal inclusions or vacuoles were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite markers for the four distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> loci on chromosomes 2, 9 and 14 were studied on affected and several unaffected family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Affected patients developed distal <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> in anterior foreleg muscles followed by progressive distal upper and proximal lower extremity involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Chromosome 2, 9 and 14 regional markers were informative and demonstrated recombinations with affected individuals in the pedigree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The resulting LOD scores obtained from the multipoint analyses gave no evidence of positive linkage to any of the regions and positively excluded (LOD score less than -2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, or virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, of the candidate regions examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> family does not show evidence of linkage to any of the known distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> loci, suggesting the existence of at least one more distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the clinical and pathological features appear distinct from other previously described but genetically-undetermined <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
