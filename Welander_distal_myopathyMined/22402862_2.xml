<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DNA samples of 101 patients in 95 kindreds at our quaternary referral center in Finland, who had undetermined <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (LGMD), calf distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase (CK) elevations of more than 2,000 IU/L, were selected for ANO5 genetic evaluation, and the clinical findings of patients with mutations were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> caused by 11 different recessive mutations in the ANO5 gene were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of mutations, 8 of 11, proved to be previously unknown new mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most frequent mutation, c.2272C&gt;T (p.R758C), was present in 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The phenotypes associated with this and the common European mutation, c.191dupA, varied from nearly asymptomatic high hyperCKemia to severe LGMD with consistently milder phenotypes in female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in ANO5 are a frequent cause of undetermined <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, with both distal and proximal presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other types include high hyperCKemia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003326'>myalgia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0008981'>calf hypertrophy</z:hpo> over decades without significant <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, especially in female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mutations are distributed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> over the gene, indicating that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> caused by ANO5 can be expected to occur in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> populations </plain></SENT>
