<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe a wide range of clinical and pathologic myopathic profiles associated with the p.K1729del mutation in the MYH7 gene, known to cause Laing distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A study conducted in the Safor region (Spain), setting of a large cluster of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical, neurophysiologic, muscle imaging, and muscle biopsy studies and MYH7 gene sequencing were investigated in 32 patients from 4 kindreds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data from 36 deceased or nonexamined patients were collected from hospital records or relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>Onset</z:hpo> ranged from congenital to the 6th decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presented <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of great toe/ankle dorsiflexors and many had associated neck flexor, finger extensor, and mild facial <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In most cases, involvement of proximal and axial muscles was observed either clinically or by muscle imaging, sometimes giving rise to scapuloperoneal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">limb-girdle syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0003326'>myalgias</z:hpo>, skeletal deformities, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in one patient were associated features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Life expectancy was not reduced but the spectrum of disability ranged from asymptomatic to wheelchair confined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Electromyographic neurogenic features were frequently recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Muscle fiber type disproportion, core/minicore lesions, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> abnormalities were the most relevant pathologic alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients carried the p.K1729del mutation in MYH7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The p.K1729del mutation in the MYH7 gene expresses notable clinical variability and electromyographic and pathologic features that can lead to the misdiagnosis of neurogenic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophies</z:mpath>, congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003737'>mitochondrial myopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mutations in genes encoding other sarcomeric and reticulo-sarcoplasmic proteins involved in calcium regulation share pathologic characteristics with our patients, suggesting a possible pathogenetic connection </plain></SENT>
