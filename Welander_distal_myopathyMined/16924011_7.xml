<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe a three-generation family with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005684'>distal arthrogryposis</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> and caused by a mutation in the gene encoding for sarcomeric thin filament protein troponin I, TNNI2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors performed clinical investigations and reviewed medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsy specimens were obtained for morphologic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was extracted from blood and analyzed for mutations in TNNI2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The five affected individuals had predominantly distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002803'>congenital joint contractures</z:hpo>, mild facial involvement (mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000347'>micrognathia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000581'>narrow palpebral fissures</z:hpo>), and no detectable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The four affected adults had slightly increased levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase in blood, and muscle biopsy specimens showed findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with changes restricted to type 2 fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These included variability of muscle fiber size, internalized nuclei, and increased interstitial connective tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of TNNI2 encoding the troponin I isoform expressed in type 2 muscle fibers disclosed a heterozygous three-base in-frame deletion, 2,918-2,920del, skipping the highly conserved lysine at position 176 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mutation was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 affected individuals but was not identified in any of the 11 unaffected family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005684'>Distal arthrogryposis</z:hpo> type 1 is genetically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> due to sarcomeric protein dysfunction may be one underlying cause of the disease </plain></SENT>
