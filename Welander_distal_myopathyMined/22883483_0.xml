<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The gene GNE encodes a bifunctional enzyme, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its mutations are found in distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> (DMRV) and hereditary inclusion body <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (HIBM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Those disorders are characterized clinically by predominant anterior tibial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, and pathologically by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> on muscle biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 11 Korean patients with GNE mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mutations showed ethnic similarity to those of Japanese patients, showing the highest frequency with V572L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another mutation of C13S was also found recurring in our patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, about half of the patients showed limb-girdle <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> rather than distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was further represented by limb muscle CT scans revealing atrophic hamstring and relatively spared anterior tibial muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, quadriceps muscles were consistently spared both in distal and limb-girdle phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study demonstrates a phenotypic diversity associated with GNE mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recognizing a wider clinical spectrum of GNE mutations will help benefit more patients with imminent new therapy </plain></SENT>
