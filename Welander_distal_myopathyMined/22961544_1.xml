<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Disease associated with mutations in filamin C rod domain leading to expression of a toxic protein presents with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009073'>progressive proximal muscle weakness</z:hpo> and shows focal destructive lesions of polymorphous aggregates containing desmin, myotilin and other proteins in the affected myofibres; these features correspond to the profile of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003715'>myofibrillar myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The second variant associated with mutations in the actin-binding domain of filamin C is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002460'>weakness of distal muscles</z:hpo> and morphologically by non-specific myopathic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A frameshift mutation in the filamin C rod domain causing haploinsufficiency was also found responsible for distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with some <z:hpo ids='HP_0003715'>myofibrillar changes</z:hpo> but no protein aggregation typical of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003715'>myofibrillar myopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Controversial data accumulating in the literature require re-evaluation and comparative analysis of phenotypes associated with the position of the FLNC mutation and investigation of the underlying disease mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is relevant and necessary for the refinement of diagnostic criteria and developing therapeutic approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We identified a p.W2710X mutation in families originating from ethnically diverse populations and re-evaluated a family with a p.V930_T933del mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the expanded database allows us to refine clinical and myopathological characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003715'>myofibrillar myopathy</z:hpo> caused by mutations in the rod domain of filamin C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Biophysical and biochemical studies indicate that certain pathogenic mutations in FLNC cause protein misfolding, which triggers aggregation of the mutant filamin C protein and subsequently involves several other proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence analyses using markers for the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy reveal that the affected muscle fibres react to protein aggregate formation with a highly increased expression of chaperones and proteins involved in proteasomal protein degradation and autophagy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, there is a noticeably diminished efficiency of both the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy that impairs the muscle capacity to prevent the formation or mediate the degradation of aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Transfection studies of cultured muscle cells imitate events observed in the patient's affected muscle and therefore provide a helpful model for testing future therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
