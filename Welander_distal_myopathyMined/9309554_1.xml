<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>UEA I labelled endomysial capillaries and endothelial cells of perimysial blood vessels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the examined muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no UEA I binding to muscle fibres except for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> (9) cases of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with rimmed vacuole formation (DMRV), 1 of 5 cases of inclusion body <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo> and 1 of 36 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009071'>inflammatory myopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The UEA I binding was completely eliminated by preincubation of UEA I solution with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18287,2181">L-fucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using electron microscopy, the UEA I binding was localized to sarcolemma and intrasarco-plasmic membranous organelles other than mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Myosatellite cells were not labelled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings revealed the existence of fucosylated proteins or <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in a subset of skeletal muscles suffering from DMRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Biochemical identification of the fucosylated substance and further detailed study on subcellular localization of UEA I binding may yield important clues to the unknown pathogenesis of DMRV </plain></SENT>
