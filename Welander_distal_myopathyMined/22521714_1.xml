<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most reports describe it as a mild, early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with involvement usually restricted to foot extensors, hand finger extensors and neck flexors, and unspecific findings on muscle biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified the first two Italian families with Laing distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, harboring two novel mutations in the MYH7 gene and performed clinical, neurophysiological, pathological, muscle MRI and cardiological investigations on affected members from the two families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects from one family presented a moderate-severe phenotype, with proximal together with distal involvement and even loss of ambulation at advanced age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient displayed atypical muscle biopsy findings including cytoplasmic bodies and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003715'>myofibrillar myopathy</z:hpo>-like features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Affected members from the second family shared a very mild phenotype, with <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> largely limited to <z:hpo ids='HP_0010511'>long toe</z:hpo> and foot extensors and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patient showed any sign of heart involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study significantly broadens the clinical and pathological spectrum of Laing distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that MYH7 screening should be considered in undiagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> or cytoplasmic body <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
