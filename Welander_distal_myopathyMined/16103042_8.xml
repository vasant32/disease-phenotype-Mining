<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Laing early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD1</z:e>) is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> caused by mutations within the slow skeletal muscle fibre myosin heavy chain gene, MYH7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is allelic with myosin storage <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, with the commonest form of familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and with one form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical picture of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD1</z:e> is distinct from these three conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To collate and discuss the histological features reported in the muscle biopsies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD1</z:e> patients and to outline the clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The phenotype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD1</z:e> was consistent, with initial <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of great toe/ankle dorsiflexion, and later development of <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of finger extension and neck flexion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>Age of onset</z:hpo> was the only variable, being from birth up to the 20 s, but progression was always very slow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pathological features were variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this retrospective series, there were no pathognomonic diagnostic features, although atrophic type I fibres were found in half the families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>Rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> are consistently seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> with the exception of Myoshi distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, they were found in a minority of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD1</z:e>, and were not prominent when present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining for slow and fast myosin showed co-expression of slow and fast myosin in some type I fibres, possibly indicating a switch to type II status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This may be a useful aid to diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The pathological findings in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD1</z:e> are variable and appear to be affected by factors such as the specific muscle biopsied, the age of the patient at biopsy, and the duration of disease manifestations </plain></SENT>
