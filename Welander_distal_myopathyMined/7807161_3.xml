<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied a family with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> (fifth or sixth decade) or asymptomatic hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> of the anterior tibial muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of the disease in two successive generations pointed out an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The initial symptom was uni- or bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003377'>foot drop</z:hpo> resembling peroneal <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly many of the diagnosed patients were asymptomatic and considered themselves healthy whether there was any <z:hpo ids='HP_0003377'>foot drop</z:hpo> or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The anterior tibial muscles were atrophic in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003377'>foot drop</z:hpo> but the <z:hpo ids='HP_0010511'>long toe</z:hpo> extensors were usually and the short ones were always spared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Apparently the toe extensors could relieve the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003377'>foot drop</z:hpo> symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As shown by computed tomography there was often an early uni- or bilateral involvement of the semimembranosus muscle in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proband showed also a late involvement of the femoral biceps and the minor gluteal muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The muscles of the upper extremity were spared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The anterior tibial muscles had a characteristic myopathic alteration with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> in histopathological study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This picture was most evident in latent cases without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the anterior tibial muscle, but with distinctly <z:hpo ids='HP_0003457'>abnormal EMG</z:hpo> of that muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Non-affected muscles showed only slight non-specific histopathological changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We suggest that this disease is a new mild variety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
