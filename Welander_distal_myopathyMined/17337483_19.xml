<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> have been associated with mutations in titin, dysferlin, GNE, desmin and myosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these, only titin mutations were previously known to cause dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent findings, however, have indicated that patients affected with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003715'>myofibrillar myopathy</z:hpo> have a more distal than proximal <z:mp ids='MP_0005369'>muscle phenotype</z:mp> and a proportion of these may have mutations in myotilin, ZASP or filamin C, besides previously known desmin and alphaB-crystallin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we report that the disorder in one of the well-characterized <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> families, the Markesbery et al. family, first reported in 1974, is caused by ZASP mutation A165V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Previous linkage to the titin locus 2q31 proved incorrect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ZASP expression by immunoblotting shows <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> presence of the main 32 and 78 kDa bands and immunohistochemistry in patients reveals <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Z-disc localization except for moderate accumulations together with myotilin, desmin alphaB-crystallin and alpha-actinin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Muscle imaging reveals involvement in both the posterior and anterior compartments of the lower leg and considerable affection of proximal leg muscles at later stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Haplotype studies in this family and in five other unrelated families with European ancestry carrying the identical A165V mutation share common markers at the locus suggesting the existence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutation </plain></SENT>
