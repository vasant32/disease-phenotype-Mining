<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, 26 muscle biopsies from 25 dysferlinopathy patients were analysed by routine histochemistry and by immunohistochemistry with eight different antibodies, and scored for <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> and type of cell infiltrate, fibre degeneration and regeneration, fibre type composition and severity of histopathological changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In cases with an advanced-stage dystrophic pattern we observed type 1 fibre predominance exceeding 80%, suggesting a selective loss of type 2 fibres or a conversion process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The extent of muscle fibre regeneration and degeneration in dysferlinopathy was intermediate between sarcoglycanopathy and Duchenne <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo>, suggesting a rather aggressive course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An <z:mp ids='MP_0001846'>increased inflammatory response</z:mp> was observed in the majority of our patients (16/26), who also showed an active dystrophic pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Type and localization of cellular infiltrates suggest that inflammatory reaction is secondary to <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules were overexpressed in dysferlinopathy, mainly in association with fibre phagocytosis and regeneration; their occasional expression in non-necrotic fibres might represent a marker of ongoing <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004510'>Muscle inflammation</z:mp> might be triggered by the structurally altered membrane consequent to dysferlin defect </plain></SENT>
