<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">Mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) play pivotal roles in intracellular signal transduction and regulate cell growth and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Upon their activation, MAPKs translocate from the cytoplasm into the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN/METHODS: The authors investigated the localization of several forms of the MAPK family-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK (p38)-in 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBM</z:e> and in 52 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the localization of immunopositive deposits and nuclei was tested with bis-benzimide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Vacuolated fibers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBM</z:e> displayed very strong focal immunoreactivity of ERK, but not of JNK or p38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ERK-positive deposits in these vacuolated fibers colocalized with the nuclear substrate of ERK, Elk-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ERK- and Elk-1-positive deposits were located frequently on the surface of the nuclei in vacuolated fibers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar findings to those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBM</z:e> were observed in three patients with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo>, but not in eight <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or the other 41 disease controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is evidence for impaired molecular transport to the nucleus from the cytoplasm in the vacuolated fibers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This could be due to cytoplasmic aggregation of ERK and Elk-1 or to abnormal nuclear pore machinery involved in the transport of ERK and its substrate upon ERK activation </plain></SENT>
