<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a novel, recessively inherited distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> caused by homozygous missense mutations in the nebulin gene (NEB), in which other combinations of mutations are known to cause nemaline (rod) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (NM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two different missense mutations were identified in homozygous form in seven Finnish patients from four unrelated families with childhood or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003377'>foot drop</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both mutations, when combined in compound heterozygous form with more disruptive mutations in NEB, are known to cause NM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hitherto, no patients with NM have been found to have two missense mutations in NEB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>Muscle weakness</z:hpo> predominantly affected ankle dorsiflexors, finger extensors and neck flexors, a distribution different both from the patterns of <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> seen in NM caused by NEB mutations, and those of the known recessively inherited distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Singleton cases need to be distinguished from the Laing type of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histologically, this <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> differs from NM in that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003798'>nemaline bodies</z:hpo> were not detectable with routine light microscopy, and they were inconspicuous or absent even with electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>Rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo>, commonly seen in other distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo>, were not a feature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that homozygous missense mutations in NEB cause a novel distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, predominantly involving lower leg extensor muscles, finger extensors and neck flexors </plain></SENT>
