<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Miyoshi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, a type of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with predominant involvement of the posterior calf muscles, has been assigned to mutations in the dysferlin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, many of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> limb-girdle and distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> that resemble dysferlinopathy or Miyoshi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> remain unclassified, even after extensive immunohistological and genetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 59-year-old Caucasian man with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003738'>exercise-induced myalgia</z:hpo>, preferentially of the leg muscles, closely resembling the Miyoshi phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging of his calf muscles showed typical fatty replacement of the medial heads of the gastrocnemius muscles and soleus muscles, with progression to the adductor longus muscles over a time course of two years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, genetic analysis revealed that the phenotype of our patient was not related to a mutation in the dysferlin gene but to a novel homozygous splice mutation in the anoctamin 5 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the anoctamin 5 gene have so far been identified only in some cases of limb-girdle and distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the anoctamin 5 gene have been assigned to <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> type 2L, while distal Miyoshi-like phenotypes have been classified as Miyoshi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> type 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The case presented in this report further strengthens the underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> in Miyoshi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>-like phenotypes and adds another family to non-dysferlin, Miyoshi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> type 3 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our case supports the recent observation that anoctamin 5 mutations are a primary cause of distal non-dysferlin <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, given the increasing number of anoctamin 5 mutations in Miyoshi-like phenotypes, genetic analysis should include an anoctamin 5 screen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> limb-girdle and distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
