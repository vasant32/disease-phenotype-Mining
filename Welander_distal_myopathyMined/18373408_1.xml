<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High correlation of disease susceptibility with GNE:p.M712T allows its use as a molecular marker for diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we applied and validated the use of melting curve analysis using SimpleProbe technology for detection of this mutation using specimens obtained by mouthwash, buccal swab, and whole blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The assay was then applied to 43 clinical specimens, and results were validated by additional methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A probe spanning this mutation in exon 12 accurately discerns two Tm corresponding to its hybridization to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and M712T-derived amplicons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 10 degrees C divergence in Tm allowed rapid single-tube genotyping of reference and patient samples with 100% accuracy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Application of SimpleProbes for detection of GNE:p.M712T on genomic DNA obtained from buccal epithelial cells allows accurate, rapid, and cost-effective identification of this allele in individuals at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This procedure is amenable to automated high-throughput applications and can be extended to both clinical and research applications </plain></SENT>
