<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disorder appears to be of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> and to be inherited through a dominant autosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has a more malignant course than the distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> described earlier, from which it can be differentiated clinically by an early involvement of thenar muscles and hand flexors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The key to the correct diagnosis is provided by the morphological and immunohistological investigation of muscle biopsies, which show typical sarcoplasmic bodies and an abundance of intermediate-sized (skeletin) filaments </plain></SENT>
