<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a unique six-generation, highly consanguineous family originating from an isolated mountainous village in the Russian province of Daghestan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three separate clinical phenotypes of progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> were identified in this large family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven patients developed a classical limb-girdle variant of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (LGMD), with disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> at 15-30 years and loss of ambulation within a 25-year course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second group included three patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> first manifested in the late teens and confined to the tibial and calf muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each of these two phenotypes segregated independently as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> trait, and muscle biopsies showed non-specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathic changes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lastly, two male siblings exhibited an atypical variant of Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> confirmed by detection of a deletion in the dystrophin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To clarify the molecular basis of the polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> in this kindred, we performed molecular genetic studies on 67 family members and obtained significant evidence for linkage to chromosome 2p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A maximum pairwise lod (logarithm of odds) score of 5.64 was achieved at the zero recombination fraction (i.e. at theta = 0.00) for locus D2S291; multipoint linkage analysis confirmed the most likely location of a mutant gene near D2S291 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients with LGMD and those with the distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> phenotype share a common affected homozygous haplotype associated with the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> chromosome; key recombinants defined D2S286 and D2S292 to be the closest loci flanking the mutant gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, two clinically distinct forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, LGMD type 2B (LGMD2B) and Miyoshi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, were recently mapped to the same locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three chromosome 2p-linked conditions may represent allelic disorders, i.e. different phenotypic expressions of a single gene </plain></SENT>
