<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the DMRV/hIBM mouse model, which exhibits hyposialylation in various tissues in addition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle atrophy</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, and degeneration, we recently have demonstrated that the myopathic phenotype was prevented by oral administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17012">N-acetylneuraminic acid</z:chebi>, N-acetylmannosamine, and sialyllactose, underscoring the crucial role of hyposialylation in the disease pathomechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The choice for the preferred molecule, however, was limited probably by the complex pharmacokinetics of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acids</z:chebi> and the lack of biomarkers that could clearly show dose response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To address these issues, we screened several synthetic sugar compounds that could increase sialylation more remarkably and allow demonstration of measurable effects in the DMRV/hIBM mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found that tetra-O-acetylated N-acetylmannosamine increased cell sialylation most efficiently, and in vivo evaluation in DMRV/hIBM mice revealed a more dramatic, measurable effect and improvement in <z:mp ids='MP_0005369'>muscle phenotype</z:mp>, enabling us to establish analysis of protein biomarkers that can be used for assessing response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results provide a proof of concept in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi>-related molecular therapy with synthetic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35381">monosaccharides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
