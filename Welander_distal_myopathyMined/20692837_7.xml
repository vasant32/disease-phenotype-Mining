<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have been following clinically and with muscle MRI for the past 3-decades a Finnish family with two patients with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously we demonstrated the cellular defect in these patients to be defective membrane repair and more recently have identified the causative gene to be anoctamin 5 (ANO5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The disorder seen in these patients is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in the third decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First symptoms were burning sensation on the calves and later on calf tightness during running </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>Muscle weakness</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005150'>wasting</z:mp> were asymmetric and early involving the calf muscles, later spread to the thigh muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biceps brachi was later manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical course was slow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CK levels were high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsy showed dystrophic pattern and multifocal disruption of the sarcolemmal membrane but no subsarcolemmal vesicle accumulation nor active <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the disease seen in our cases is a new separate clinical, genetic and histopathologic entity to include within the classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
