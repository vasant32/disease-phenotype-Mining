<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At 3 years of age, he had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003698'>difficulty in standing</z:hpo> on tip-toe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase was 1074IU/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Muscle CT scan showed low-density areas in the lower legs and upper arms, but predominantly in the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsy of the biceps brachii muscle showed moderate dystrophic changes with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> dysferlin expression on immunohistochemical and western blot analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although muscle involvement mimicked that seen in Miyoshi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (MM), the very early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> were quite unusual for MM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We, therefore, made the diagnosis of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> dysferlin-positive distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, probably a new type of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
