<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six cases showed slight to moderate histopathological changes and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> distinction between Type I and Type II muscle fibres, based on their staining characteristics for myofibrillar ATPase, was well preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A selective Type I <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and an irregular distribution of oxidative enzyme and fat staining in Type I fibres were evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the other 7 cases, with moderate to advanced histopathological changes, there was a marked blurring of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> difference observed in ATPase activity between Type I and TYpe II fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, both types of fibre exhibited a high intensity of staining for myofibrillar ATPase at pH 9.4 without inhibition by acid preincubation (pH 4.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These changes in phosphatase activity were found not only in atrophic fibres but also in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-sized fibres without other signs of degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nuclear proliferation in chains and "ring fibres" were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The early histopathological and histochemical changes in distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> are strikingly similar to those of myotonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
