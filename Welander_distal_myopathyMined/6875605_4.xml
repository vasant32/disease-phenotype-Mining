<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most conspicuous features were: early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>onset in adulthood</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> first affecting the distal leg muscles, marked elevation of serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase (CK) activity, and electromyographic and histopathological findings predominantly consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computed tomographic examination of the skeletal musculature revealed that the most extensive changes were in the distal muscles of the legs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, some proximal muscles also appeared to be involved, both clinically and radiologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One conspicuous finding in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was the presence of marked low density abnormalities in the gluteus minimus muscles </plain></SENT>
