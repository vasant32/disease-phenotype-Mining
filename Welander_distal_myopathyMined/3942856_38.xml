<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new type of progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, is described, based on observations on 17 cases (8 males and 9 females) in 8 families, including an autopsied case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease developed in young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>Muscle weakness</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> were most marked in the distal parts of the legs, especially in the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, and then spread to the thighs and gluteal muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early impairment of standing on tip-toe with retention of the ability to stand on the heels was conspicuous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Difficulty in climbing stairs, standing up and walking subsequently appeared, but rarely progressed to confinement to bed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The forearms became mildly atrophic, with decrease in grip strength, but the small hand muscles were spared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The EMG showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathic changes</z:hpo> and nerve conduction was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase activity was characteristically increased up to 100-fold in the early stages of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was also markedly increased in subjects in the preclinical stage and mildly in some heterozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsies revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathic changes</z:hpo> with severe segmental <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> accompanied by regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The changes were similar to those of Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An autopsied case, aged 68 years, showed generalized muscle abnormalities with a distal predominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The muscles in the lower legs, especially those of the calves, were severely affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No lesions were found in the brain, spinal cord or peripheral nerves </plain></SENT>
