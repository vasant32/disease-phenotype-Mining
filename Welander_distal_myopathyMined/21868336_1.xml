<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five patients with typical clinical and pathological features of DMRV were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the 11 coding exons and the flanking intron sequences of GNE gene were amplified by PCR and sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four family members of case 5 were also examined for GNE gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were identified to have different GNE gene mutations: Cases 1-4 had complex heterozygous mutations and case 5 had homozygous mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six reported mutations had been identified, including 1 nonsense mutation (p.R8X) and 5 missense mutations (p.D176V, p.I298T, p.A591T, P.A631V, and p.V696M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A novel mutation (c.317T&gt;C, p.I106T) was identified in case 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first report of p.R8X, p.I298T, p.A591T and p.V696M mutations in GNE gene in Chinese population, and a novel mutation p.I106T was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings further expand the clinical and genetic spectrum of DMRV in China </plain></SENT>
