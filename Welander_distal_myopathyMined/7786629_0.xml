<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was apparently well until 17 years of age when he noted a decrease in exercise tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One year later, he noted difficulty in arising his heels when the walked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He was admitted to our service for the work up in June 10, 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On admission, the patient was rather slender in the body build up; otherwise general physical examination was unremarkable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Upon neurologic examination, mental status and higher cerebral functions were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the cranial nerves, the sternocleidomastoid muscles were atrophic bilaterally; other cranial nerves appeared intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>His gait was unstable and he showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003376'>steppage gait</z:hpo>; walking on toes and heels were impossible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Distal dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle atrophy</z:hpo> was noted in both upper and lower extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Muscle strength in the deltoid, biceps brachii and triceps brachii was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the lower extremities, both tibialis anterior and triceps surae muscles were weak (3/5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The iliopsoas and quadriceps femoris muscles were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, however, the adductor muscles of the thigh showed marked <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> (2/5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002486'>Myotonia</z:hpo> was absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Deep reflexes were decreased; sensation was intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Routine blood tests were unremarkable; CK was 96 IU/l, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> 6.9 mg/dl, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> 0.61 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>After an ischemic forearm exercise test, blood <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> level rose to 22.5mg/dl (base line 11.2), and blood ammonia to 88.3 micrograms/dl (base line 71.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>EMG showed myogenic changes and myotonic discharges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A diagnostic biopsy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The patient was discussed in a neurologic CPC, and the chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that the patient had type III <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267971" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">storage disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The differential diagnosis included rimmed vacuole type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, Miyoshi type distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, Welander type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, adult type <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017921" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="AMD">acid-maltase deficiency</z:e>, and lysosomal <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267971" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">storage disease</z:e> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> acid maltase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>However, characteristic clinical presentation of initial <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> in the triceps surae muscle associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the sternocleidomastoid muscle confirmed best of the clinical characteristics of type III <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267971" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">storage disease</z:e>; the only finding which did not fit with its diagnosis was elevation of the blood <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> level after the ischemic exercise test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The muscle biopsy specimen showed marked vacuole formation; approximately 20 to 30% of the vacuoles were <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo>, however, the majority was not rimmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> staining on an epon-embedded specimen revealed marked accumulation of <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>-positive materials in those vacuoles as well as in the interfascular space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> were not positively stained in the acid-phosphatase staining, which exclude the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017921" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="AMD">acid maltase deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> abnormalities were found.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
