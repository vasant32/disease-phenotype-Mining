<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This report describes a large consanguineous family with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> in 23 patients showing intrafamilial variation of clinical expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One main variant appeared in the first decade with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003701'>proximal muscle weakness</z:hpo> progressing over the next 20 years to wheelchair confinement, and appeared compatible with classical <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The other main variant showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009053'>distal muscle weakness in lower limbs</z:hpo> in the third or fourth decade, progressing very slowly without greater disability throughout the lifetime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tibial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005150'>wasting</z:mp> were clinical landmarks in this variant, but computed tomography of skeletal muscle revealed focal areas of fatty degeneration also in truncal, pelvifemoral, and distal leg muscles in a way not previously reported in distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall difference in clinical findings between these main variants would suggest 2 separate genetic entities, genealogical data makes a common genetic background possible </plain></SENT>
