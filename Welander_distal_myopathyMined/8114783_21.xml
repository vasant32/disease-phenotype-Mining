<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease begins in early to middle adulthood with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbance</z:hpo> due to distal <z:mp ids='MP_0009434'>leg weakness</z:mp>, and progresses over 5-10 years to involve <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> extremities, as well as bulbar, respiratory, and facial muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is frequent cardiac involvement, manifest by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, conduction blocks, and congestive failure, resulting in premature demise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On electromyography there is prominent spontaneous activity, short duration motor unit potentials, and polyphasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsies from multiple family members at different stages of the disease are characterized by desmin storage and autophagocytosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> differs from other phenotypically similar disorders in its rapidity of progression, fatal course and pathologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The role and specificity of excessive desmin accumulation in this and other myopathic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disorders</z:e> are unknown </plain></SENT>
