<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is a major clinical manifestation in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> and an important prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although dysferlin is highly expressed in cardiac muscle, the effect of dysferlin deficiency in cardiac muscle has not been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that early myocardial dysfunction could be detected by 2D strain echocardiography and late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement (LGE) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Five consecutive MM patients (3 male) in whom we detected the DYSF gene mutation and age-matched healthy control subjects were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> or signs and symptoms of overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were studied using 2D strain echocardiography and CMR, with 2D strain being obtained using the Automated Function Imaging technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had preserved left ventricular systolic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, segmental Peak Systolic Longitudinal Strain (PSLS) was decreased in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Global PSLS was significantly lower in patients with MM than in control subjects (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Basal anterior septum, basal inferior septum, mid anterior, and mid inferior septum PSLS were significantly lower in patients with MM than in control subjects (P &lt; 0.0001, &lt; 0.0001, 0.038 and 0.003, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four patients showed <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> by LGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The reduced PSLS lesion detected by 2D strain tended to be in the same area as that which showed <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> by LGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MM showed subclinical involvement of the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>2D strain and LGE are sensitive methods for detecting myocardial dysfunction prior to the development of cardiovascular symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The prognostic significance of these findings warrants further longitudinal follow-up </plain></SENT>
