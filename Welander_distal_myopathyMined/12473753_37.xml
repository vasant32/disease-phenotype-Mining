<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> (DMRV) is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal-recessive</z:hpo> disorder with preferential involvement of the tibialis anterior muscle that starts in young adulthood and spares quadriceps muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease locus has been mapped to chromosome 9p1-q1, the same region as the hereditary inclusion body <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (HIBM) locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HIBM was originally described as rimmed vacuole <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> sparing the quadriceps; therefore, the two diseases have been suspected to be allelic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, HIBM was shown to be associated with the mutations in the gene encoding the bifunctional enzyme, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether DMRV and HIBM are allelic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The GNE gene was sequenced in 34 patients with DMRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The epimerase activity in lymphocytes from eight DMRV patients was also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The authors identified 27 unrelated DMRV patients with homozygous or compound-heterozygous mutations in the GNE gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DMRV patients had markedly decreased epimerase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DMRV is allelic to HIBM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Various mutations are associated with DMRV in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The loss-of-function mutations in the GNE gene appear to cause DMRV/HIBM </plain></SENT>
