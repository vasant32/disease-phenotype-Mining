<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The myopathic muscle of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (Welander's disease), the dominantly inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular disorder</z:e> which occurs frequently in Sweden, has been characterized by electron microscopy, enzyme- and immuno-histochemistry (using antibodies against embryonic, neonatal, fast and slow myosin, and against the muscle-specific intermediate filament protein, desmin), and with gel electrophoretic techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of special interest is the fact that the ultrastructural appearance of the fibres with regard to M- and Z-band structures does not fit the proposed classification criteria for ultrastructural fibre typing of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, contrary to previous results, we conclusively demonstrate that the predominating fibres are of a slow-twitch type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, we also observed that embryonic and neonatal myosin was expressed in some residual fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This emphasises the importance of supplementing stains to demonstrate activity of ATPase with myosin immuno-histochemistry in order to improve understanding of fibre type characteristics in myopathic muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The origin of the myopathic muscle fibres in distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> could not be definitely determined, but it is suggested that neurogenic disturbances play an important part in the pathophysiology of Welander's disease </plain></SENT>
