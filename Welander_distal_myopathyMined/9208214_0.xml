<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since then a lot of cases with different <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo>, clinical involvement and morphological findings have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Obviously distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> are not a single entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe four new cases of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although we suppose that they are from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> Welander's form, they are different in some points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two cases were with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in the lower limbs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant inheritance</z:hpo>, the third one was <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in the lower limbs and the last one was <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in the upper limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distal muscles were markedly, while the proximal were slightly involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sternocleidomastoid, neck or facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscles wasting</z:hpo> were also found in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was in nearly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The electromyographic findings were consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, although <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> potentials and positive sharp waves were found in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsy data confirm the myopathic involvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We have described patients, which confirm the variability of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo>, regarding the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, initial symptoms, clinical picture, electromyographic and muscle biopsy findings </plain></SENT>
