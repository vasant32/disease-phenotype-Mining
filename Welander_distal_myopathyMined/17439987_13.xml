<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In 1965, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> disorder with a peculiar scapuloperoneal distribution of <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was described in a large, multi-generation kindred and named 'scapuloperoneal syndrome type Kaeser' (OMIM #181400) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By genetic analysis of the original kindred, we discovered a heterozygous missense mutation of the desmin gene (R350P) cosegregating with the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we detected DES R350P in four unrelated German families allowing for genotype-phenotype correlations in a total of 15 patients carrying the same mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Large clinical variability was recognized, even within the same family, ranging from scapuloperoneal (n = 2, 12%), limb girdle (n = 10, 60%) and distal phenotypes (n = 3, 18%) with variable cardiac (n = 7, 41%) or respiratory involvement (n = 7, 41%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Facial <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000771'>gynaecomastia</z:hpo> were frequent additional symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall and within each family, affected men seemingly bear a higher risk of sudden, cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as compared to affected women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, histological and immunohistochemical examination of muscle biopsy specimens revealed a wide spectrum of findings ranging from near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or unspecific pathology to typical, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003715'>myofibrillar changes</z:hpo> with accumulation of desmin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study reveals that the clinical and pathological variability generally observed in desminopathies may not be attributed to the nature of the DES mutation alone, but may be influenced by additional genetic and epigenetic factors such as gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, mutations of the desmin gene should be considered early in the diagnostic work-up of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo>, dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, even if specific myofibrillar pathology is absent </plain></SENT>
