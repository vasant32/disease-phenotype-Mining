<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to investigate the contribution of the lysosomal system, particularly autophagosome formation (an autophagic process) at the molecular level, to the abnormal accumulation of vacuoles in an experimental model of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Histological, immunohistochemical and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction studies were performed on innervated and denervated rat soleus muscles after treatment with either saline or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Accumulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> was observed only in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi>-treated denervated muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain-3 (LC3) protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were significantly increased exclusively in denervated muscles from <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi>-treated rats, whereas Apg5 and Apg12 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels did not change significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE), which are associated with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> showing numerous <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> in its skeletal muscle, were not decreased in denervatedmuscles treated with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LC3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> may increase in association with rimmed vacuole formation in denervated muscles from <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi>-treated rats, suggesting an increase in autophagy at the molecular level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Abnormal accumulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> in this <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> does not appear to be mediated by inhibition of autophagosome-related genes or GNE gene </plain></SENT>
