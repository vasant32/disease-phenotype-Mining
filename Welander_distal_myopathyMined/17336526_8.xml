<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MYH7 gene studies revealed the 5533C&gt;T mutation (Arg1845Trp) in both myosin storage <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> and in 2 of the 17 scapulo-peroneal patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>5533C&gt;T segregation analysis in the mutation carrier families identified 11 additional patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical spectrum in our cohort of patients included asymptomatic hyperCKemia, scapulo-peroneal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> and proximal and distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003712'>muscle hypertrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Muscle MRI identified a unique pattern in the posterior compartment of the thigh, characterized by early involvement of the biceps femoris and semimembranosus, with relative sparing of the semitendinosus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsy revealed hyaline bodies in only half of biopsied patients (2/4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, phenotypic and histopathological variability may underlie MYH7 gene mutation and the absence of hyaline bodies in muscle biopsies does not rule out MYH7 gene mutations </plain></SENT>
