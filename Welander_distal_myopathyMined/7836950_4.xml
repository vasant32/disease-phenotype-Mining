<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined 19 muscle biopsies from 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (DisMD) histochemically and immunohistochemically to characterize the histologic features of this disease and to determine whether dystrophin and dystrophin-associated proteins (DAPs) are normally present in the muscles of patients with this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The common histologic features in DisMD were active <z:hpo ids='HP_0003713'>muscle fiber necrosis</z:hpo> and regeneration with variation in fiber size, predominantly in the gastrocnemius muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were occasional disorganizations of the intermyofibrillar network such as moth-eaten appearance, lobulated, whorled and targetoid fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one half of the patients, small angular fibers and scattered <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> were also found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On immunohistochemical examination, dystrophin, DAPs, spectrin and laminin were normally expressed along the surface membrane of muscle fibers, even in the advanced stages of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, dystrophin was absent and DAPs reduced in the sarcolemma of Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD) muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall histochemical features in DisMD were similar to those seen in DMD, though dystrophin and DAPs were normally expressed even in severely affected gastrocnemius muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A defect in an as yet unidentified protein rather than in DAPs and dystrophin is probably responsible for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003713'>muscle fiber necrosis</z:hpo> in DisMD </plain></SENT>
