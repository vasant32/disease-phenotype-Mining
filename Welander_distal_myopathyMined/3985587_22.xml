<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although these two forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in young adulthood were highly similar in their clinical symptoms, histochemical and electron microscopic findings of muscles subjected to biopsy were quite different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The muscle abnormalities in distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> were almost the same as those in Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, showing massive fiber <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> followed by active fiber regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with rimmed vacuole formation showed a progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100295'>muscle fiber atrophy</z:hpo> and loss, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> in the sarcoplasm, and no apparent fiber <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> or regeneration </plain></SENT>
