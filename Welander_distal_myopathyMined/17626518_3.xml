<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of desmin mutations as a cause of various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is still undetermined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyse the frequency of desmin mutations in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> identified and diagnosed in the St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Petersburg area of Russia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We screened 98 patients with dilated, 40 with hypertrophic and 4 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001723'>restrictive cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> exons of the desmin gene were amplified by PCR and studied by sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two out of 98 patients showed the presence of desmin gene mutations, not previously described in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A novel IVS2-2A--&gt;G splice site mutation, presumably causing skipping of exon 3, was detected in a case of familial right ventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An A213V mutation was associated with a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No desmin mutations were found in patients with hypertrophic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001723'>restrictive cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Desmin mutations should be considered a relatively rare cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in this specific geographic area </plain></SENT>
