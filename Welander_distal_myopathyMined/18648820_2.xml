<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) has been successfully applied for oncologic and cardiovascular diagnostics, whereas imaging in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> usually employs dedicated protocols restricted to areas of specific interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we propose a comprehensive neuromuscular WB-MRI protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients with degenerative and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027121" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IIM">inflammatory muscle diseases</z:e> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whole-body imaging was performed on a 1.5-T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> system using parallel imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Examination time was 41:26 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Coronal and axial T1-weighted and coronal short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequences of the whole body were acquired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Images were analysed by two radiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With this protocol we could detect characteristic involvement patterns in different <z:hpo ids='HP_0003715'>myofibrillar myopathies</z:hpo> (MFMs): Patients with myotilinopathy showed frequent involvement of the rhomboid muscles (4/5), the erector spinae (5/5), the biceps femoris and the semimembranosus (5/5), while the semitendinosus was relatively spared (2/5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in desminopathy patients the ilipsoas (3/4), the sartorius, (3/4), the gracilis (3/4) and the semitendinosus (3/4) were frequently involved, while the semimembranosus was spared (1/4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As shown for MFMs, WB-MRI is an appropriate modality to detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_591'>fatty infiltration</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> in skeletal muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>WB-MRI could be more useful than dedicated examinations for differential diagnosis, muscle biopsy planning and noninvasive follow-up examinations </plain></SENT>
