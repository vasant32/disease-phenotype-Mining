<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among recessive forms, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> resulting from mutations in the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) gene, often designated as Nonaka <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, primarily affect young adults and are characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle wasting</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> predominating on the anterior compartment of the leg, a remarkable quadriceps sparing and a frequent evolution towards ambulation loss after a few years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Finding <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> on muscle biopsy is a further argument for the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the presentation and course may vary and we describe four patients who illustrate the clinical spectrum of the disease: the first patient had a classical form with progressive <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> over several years, the second one a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapidly progressive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> leading to ambulation loss within three years from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, the third one a very slow course with no ambulation loss after several decades, and the last one a progressive form with misleading neurogenic features on the EMG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of our four patients harbored a homozygous mutation, and three others were compound heterozygous, two of them displaying an original mutation: one had a c.2036 T&gt;G (p.Val679Gly) substitution, the c.829 C&gt;T (p.Arg277Cys) substitution </plain></SENT>
