<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two large pedigrees have been described which have both types of patient in the same families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in both pedigrees LGMD2B and MM patients are homozygous for haplotypes of the critical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This suggested that the same mutation in the same gene would lead to both LGMD2B or MM in these families and that additional factors were needed to explain the development of the different clinical phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present paper we show that in one of these families Pro791 of dysferlin is changed to an Arg residue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both the LGMD2B and MM patients in this kindred are homozygous for this mutation, as are four additional patients from two previously unpublished families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analyses suggest a common origin of the mutation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On western blots of muscle, LGMD2B and MM patients show a similar abundance in dysferlin staining of 15 and 11%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> tissue sections show that dysferlin localizes to the sarcolemma while tissue sections from MM and LGMD patients show minimal staining which is indistinguishable between the two types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings emphasize the role for the dysferlin gene as being responsible for both LGMD2B and MM, but that the distinction between these two clinical phenotypes requires the identification of additional factor(s), such as modifier gene(s) </plain></SENT>
