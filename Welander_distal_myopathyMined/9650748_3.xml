<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seeking evidence of transport abnormalities in distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> (DMRV), we performed immunohistochemistry for clathrin in muscle biopsy specimens from patients with this disorder or other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852419,C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular disorders</z:e>, and also in control muscle samples resected in orthopedic procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While most myofibers from control muscle did not stain for clathrin, some fibers revealed finely granular sarcoplasmic staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In specimens from patients with Duchenne and Becker <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0007354'>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo>, and DMRV, numerous clathrin-positive granules were often scattered through the sarcoplasm and seen to a lesser extent in subsarcolemmal regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative immunohistochemical assessment showed more reactivity for clathrin in DMRV than in controls and other diseased muscles, particularly in atrophic fibers and type 2 fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> strongly clathrin-positive muscle fibers contained <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo>, although most fibers with vacuoles were clathrin positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The result suggests that the lysosome system is activated and receptor-mediated intracellular transport pathways function appropriately in the muscles of DMRV patients </plain></SENT>
