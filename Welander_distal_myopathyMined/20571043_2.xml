<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may in part be due to limited availability of diagnostic tests for titin defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, a French family with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal-dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> of the tibial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> phenotype segregating in several members of the family was described </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to available medical records, the patient had a clearly more severe generalised <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> phenotype not recognised as a distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> at the time </plain></SENT>
