<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A large cluster of patients belonging to different families, with Laing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> due to p.K1729del mutation, was found in the Safor region, Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The same mutation was previously reported in an American family with Italian ancestry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The possibility that p.K1729del in MYH7 might be a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutation in the Safor patients and the chance of a common origin with the Italian-American family mutation was investigated by haplotype analyses, mutation data origin estimation and historical inquiry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results show that the p.K1729del in MYH7 harboured by patients from the Safor indeed is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A common ancestral origin of this mutation in the Spanish and Italian families is also suggested because they <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> share a core SNP haplotype at locus MYH7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data estimation yields the origin of the mutation in the Safor at the beginning of the XVII century, when the Moorish were spelt and the region was resettled with Italian families </plain></SENT>
