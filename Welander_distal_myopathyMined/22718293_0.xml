<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast to other protein glycosylations, this modification is highly reversible and, similar to phosphorylation, it plays important roles in various cell signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we immunolocalized O-GlcNAc-modified proteins in muscle biopsy specimens from 40 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular diseases</z:e> and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> muscle fibers, O-GlcNAc was found along plasma membranes and in nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diffuse and increased cytoplasmic staining of O-GlcNAc was detected in (1) regenerating muscle fibers in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003201'>rhabdomyolysis</z:hpo>; (2) a proportion of atrophic fibers in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo>, such as those found in perifascicular regions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011633" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatomyositis</z:e>; and (3) vacuolated fibers in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> inclusion body <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo> (s-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBM</z:e>) and distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> (DMRV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Target formations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>neurogenic muscular atrophy</z:hpo> were O-GlcNAc positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increase of O-GlcNAc glycosylation could be associated with the stress response, as these lesions have been shown to be positive for several stress markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vacuolar rims in s-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBM</z:e> and DMRV were sometimes sharply lined by O-GlcNAc-positive deposits, which reflects myonuclear breakdown occurring from the disease </plain></SENT>
