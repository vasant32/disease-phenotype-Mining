<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each displayed several characteristic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was in early adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Second, there was a unique distribution of muscle involvement: tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum and hallucis muscles were initially and most severely affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hamstrings and adductors of the thigh were also markedly involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The gluteus medius and minimus muscles and the neck flexors were mildly affected in the relatively early stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the gastrocnemius, soleus, quadriceps femoris, and gluteus maximus muscles were well preserved until an advanced stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Third, serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase activity was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or only mildly elevated; fourth, EMG were mainly myopathic, with certain neuropathic features; and fifth, histopathologically <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> in muscle fibers were found associated with certain "neuropathic" features, such as angular fibers, clustering of atrophic fibers, pyknotic nuclear clumps, and fiber-type predominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The characteristic distribution of skeletal muscle involvement was particularly noticeable, together with certain "neuropathic" features of the EMG and muscle biopsy in rimmed vacuolar distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
