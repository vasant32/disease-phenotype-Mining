<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The threshold values were compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, age-corrected values and also with data from an age-matched control group consisting of patients with antecedent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032371" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">poliomyelitis</z:e> with the same degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The screening examination indicated impaired thermal sensibility in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 11 patients and impairment for at least one other sensory modality in 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In comparison with age-corrected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values, the measured warm-cold difference limen was abnormal in the feet of 9 patients and the vibratory threshold at least at one test point in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When compared with the data from the paretic controls, the thermal abnormality was significant with regard to warm and cold thresholds, the warm-cold difference limen and the heat pain threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The vibration threshold abnormality was significant in the feet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that sensibility impairment is present in Welander's <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> indicating a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000763'>peripheral sensory neuropathy</z:hpo> involving both unmyelinated (C-fibers) and myelinated fibers </plain></SENT>
