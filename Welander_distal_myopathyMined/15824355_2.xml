<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report a dominant, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo> early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with sparing of the tibialis anterior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve affected and two possibly affected members from an Australian kindred were examined and investigated by EMG, imaging studies, histopathology, and genetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Affected patients had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo> condition with symmetric, distal <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005150'>wasting</z:mp> of the anterior upper and posterior lower limbs, with sparing of tibialis anterior, even in advanced disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients remained ambulant and there was no evidence of cardiac or respiratory muscle involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase levels were either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or mildly elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Imaging studies showed widespread involvement of the posterior and lateral leg compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proximal muscles were radiologically abnormal only in advanced disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Muscles that were mildly affected clinically appeared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EMG in nine patients showed widespread <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathic changes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Muscle histopathology in four patients showed either end stage muscle or nonspecific myopathic findings without <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> or vacuoles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite markers for distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> loci were analyzed and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> phenotype genes and linkage regions were formally excluded by multipoint analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The affected patients in this kindred display a clinically distinct <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, with selective involvement of posterior lower and anterior upper limb muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The genetic analysis suggests the existence of one more distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> locus </plain></SENT>
