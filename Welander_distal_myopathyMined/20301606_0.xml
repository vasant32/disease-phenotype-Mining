<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>Weakness</z:mp> of the neck flexors is seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected individuals and mild facial <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> is often present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After distal <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> has been present for more than ten years, mild proximal <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> is observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Life expectancy is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Diagnosis relies on clinical findings and molecular genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase concentration is usually <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>; muscle histology is not diagnostic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Molecular genetic testing of MYH7, the only gene known to be associated with Laing distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, is available on a clinical basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Physiotherapy to prevent or treat tightening of the tendo Achillis is helpful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In more advanced cases, lightweight splinting of the ankle (e.g., with an ankle-foot orthosis) can be useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surveillance: annual neurologic examination; electrocardiogram and echocardiogram performed at the time of initial evaluation should be repeated if symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac insufficiency</z:hpo> occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>GENETIC COUNSELING: Laing distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> is inherited in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>More than 90% of affected individuals have an affected parent: de novo mutations account for fewer than 10% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Each child of an affected individual has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible for families in which the disease-causing mutation has been identified </plain></SENT>
