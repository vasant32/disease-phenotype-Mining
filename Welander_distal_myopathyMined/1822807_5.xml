<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography (US) and low field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of muscles were performed in 13 patients of a large family with two clinically separate phenotypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five patients had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003701'>proximal muscle weakness</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005150'>wasting</z:mp> like in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Imaging methods showed loss of muscle structure and replacement with adipose tissue especially in proximal muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> with <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005150'>wasting</z:mp> of anterior tibial muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Imaging methods confirmed fatty degeneration of tibial muscles and, moreover, revealed unexpected large patchy lesions in several other clinically unaffected muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that some <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> which are clinically localized, may actually have a more widespread patchy involvement as revealed by non-invasive imaging methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this family CT and MRI were more informative concerning lesions and distribution than US </plain></SENT>
