<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several missense mutations in the myotilin gene (MYOT) have been identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (LGMD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003715'>myofibrillar myopathy</z:hpo>, and distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> previously reported pathogenic MYOT mutations have been identified only in Exon 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sequenced MYOT in 138 patients diagnosed as having LGMD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003715'>myofibrillar myopathy</z:hpo>, or distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, and identified a novel MYOT mutation in Exon 9 encoding the second immunoglobulin-like domain in 1 patient with clinically typical LGMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By light microscopy, there were scattered fibers with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> and myofibrillary disorganization in the patient's muscle biopsy; accumulation of Z disk proteins was observed by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that the amount of myotilin monomer was increased in the patient muscle, but that the myotilin homodimeric band was decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional analysis of the myotilin mutation using a yeast 2-hybrid system revealed defective homodimerization of the mutant myotilin and decreased interaction between mutant myotilin and alpha-actinin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The homodimerization defect was further demonstrated by immunoprecipitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the first MYOT mutation outside of Exon 2 in an LGMD type 1A patient and the first MYOT mutation identified in the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This mutation in the second immunoglobulin-like domain impairs myotilin dimerization and alters the binding between myotilin and alpha-actinin, which is known to be important for actin bundling </plain></SENT>
