<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Tibial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (TMD), a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> dominant distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, is caused by yet unknown mutations on chromosome 2q, whereas MD with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo> (MDM) is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> of the mouse, also progressing with age and linked to mouse chromosome 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For both disorders, linkage studies have implicated titin as a potential candidate gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors analyzed major candidate regions in the titin gene by sequencing and Southern blot hybridization, and performed titin immunohistochemistry on TMD patient material to identify the underlying mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Western blot studies were performed on the known titin ligands in muscle samples of both disorders and controls, and analysis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The authors identified almost complete loss of calpain3, a ligand of titin, in the patient with limb-girdle MD (LGMD) with a homozygous state of TMD haplotype when primary calpain3 gene defect was excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic myonuclei with altered distribution of transcription factor NF-kB and its inhibitor IkBalpha were encountered in muscle samples of patients with either heterozygous or homozygous TMD haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar findings were confirmed in the MDM mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results imply that titin mutations may be responsible for TMD, and that the pathophysiologic pathway following calpain3 deficiency may overlap with LGMD2A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The loss of calpain3 could be a downstream effect of the deficient TMD gene product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The significance of the secondary calpain3 defect for the pathogenesis of TMD was emphasized by similar calpain3 deficiency in the MDM mouse, which is suggested to be a mouse model for TMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Homozygous mutation at the 2q locus may thus be capable of producing yet another LGMD </plain></SENT>
