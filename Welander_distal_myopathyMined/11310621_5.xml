<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a novel <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> presenting in mid-adult life with tibialis anterior <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We carried out a detailed clinical assessment of 24 individuals spanning three generations, documenting pathologic features of the muscles in 7 of the 11 affected individuals, including an autopsy study on one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The second generation of affected individuals presented at an earlier age, and the disease progressed more rapidly than in the first generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lung function tests revealed progressive global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002747'>respiratory muscle weakness</z:hpo> detectable from the time of presentation, with preferential diaphragmatic involvement in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hip girdle and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003547'>shoulder girdle weakness</z:hpo> appeared later in the disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed a striking correlation between the clinical and pathological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinically unaffected muscles had minimal pathologic change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003555'>Fiber splitting</z:hpo>, eosinophilic inclusions, and vacuoles with basophilic rims were seen in moderately affected muscles, and fat and fibrous connective tissue replaced muscle fibers in the severely involved muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The inclusions were Congophilic and reacted with antibodies to desmin, beta-amyloid, and phosphorylated tau protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The disease was not linked to any of the known loci associated with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo>, confirming that the disorder in this family is both genetically and phenotypically distinct </plain></SENT>
