<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both these proteins have been implicated in sarcolemmal resealing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the basis of similarities in associated phenotypes and protein functions, we tested the hypothesis that ANO5 protein could compensate for dysferlin absence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We first defined that the main transcript of ANO5 expressed in skeletal muscle is the 22-exon full-length isoform, and we demonstrated that dysferlin-deficient (Dysf (prmd)) mice have lower Ano5 expression levels, an observation that further enhanced the rational of the tested hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then showed that AAV-mediated transfer of human ANO5 (hANO5) did not lead to apparent toxicity in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, we demonstrated that AAV-hANO5 injection was not able to compensate for dysferlin deficiency in the Dysf (prmd) mouse model or improve the membrane repair defect seen in the absence of dysferlin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consequently, overexpressing hANO5 does not seem to provide a valuable therapeutic strategy for dysferlin deficiency </plain></SENT>
