<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Further study employing long range RT-PCR and subcloning revealed a total of fourteen dysferlin transcripts with maintained dysferlin reading frame </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study also characterised the differences in relative frequencies of the dysferlin transcripts in skeletal muscle and blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings have potential implications for molecular diagnosis of dysferlinopathy and the identification of dysferlin isoforms </plain></SENT>
