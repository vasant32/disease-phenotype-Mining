<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical phenotype of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal-dominant</z:hpo> pedigree with myotilinopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two symptomatic patients and six asymptomatic gene mutation carriers were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed serum chemistry, electrophysiological assessments, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of lower limb musculature, histochemical and immunohistochemical studies of a muscle biopsy and mutation analysis of the myotilin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both symptomatic patients, aged 76 and 61 years, presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo>, distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0007340'>lower-limb weakness</z:hpo> involving the ankle and toe flexo-extensor muscles extending up to the thigh muscles; there was mild <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of the intrinsic hand musculature in the eldest patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electromyography revealed a myopathic pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase levels were slightly elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsy revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathic changes</z:hpo> with myotilin- and desmin-positive aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gene sequencing identified a myotilin S55F mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both patients, MRI showed moderate to severe fatty <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four leg muscle compartments, extending up to the thigh musculature, mainly involving the biceps, femoris, semimembranosus, vasti and glutei muscles; intrinsic foot musculature was involved but to a lesser degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six gene mutation carriers, aged from 21 to 63 years, clinical examinations showed no myopathic signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MRI was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the youngest individual, whereas in the remaining five individuals the outstanding finding was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_591'>fatty infiltration</z:mpath> of the soleus muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Myotilin S55F mutations may cause a clinically distinct <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal-dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> and lower-limb distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026848" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myopathic syndrome</z:e> involving <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four leg muscle compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MRI helps to reliably depict the topography of fatty <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle atrophy</z:hpo> and to detect early leg muscle changes in asymptomatic gene mutation carriers </plain></SENT>
