<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To clarify the classification of two previously reported groups of patients with anterior tibial distal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath>, to find additional patients with the disease, and to describe the clinical features of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: National survey of the records of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular diseases</z:e> in Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Findings of selected patients were compared with those of previously reported cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Thirty-six previously described patients and 30 additional patients from the current survey, with 41 symptomatic patients and 25 subjectively asymptomatic affected relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 66 patients with late <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> tibial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Symptoms appear after the age of 35 years with reduced ankle dorsiflexion, and progress is slow without marked disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Facial muscles, upper extremities, and proximal muscles are usually spared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsy results reveal nonspecific dystrophic changes in clinically affected muscles, and frequently severe adipose replacement in the anterior tibial muscles occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic muscles have mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathic changes</z:hpo> only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vacuolar degeneration is detected in a minority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Electromyography shows profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathic changes</z:hpo> in the anterior tibial muscle, but extensor brevis muscles are well preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of muscles discloses marked involvement of tibial extensor muscles and focal patches of fatty degeneration in various asymptomatic muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pedigree data suggest <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Tibial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> might represent a new form of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> and it is rather common, at least in Finland </plain></SENT>
