<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DMRV/hIBM is characterized clinically by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle atrophy</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> initially involving the distal muscles, and pathologically by the presence of small angular fibers, formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> and deposition of various proteins in the muscle fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This disease is known to be caused by mutations in the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase gene, which encodes the essential enzyme in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> biosynthesis, leading to a reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> levels in the serum and skeletal muscles of affected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As it is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disease</z:e>, metabolite supplementation is theoretically one of the therapeutic options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this review, recent animal models for DMRV/hIBM are briefly characterized followed by a focus on the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> metabolites as a reliable therapeutic option to DMRV/hIBM with the following points highlighted: the property of compounds, the pharmacokinetic metabolism in vivo, and the therapeutic effects on the DMRV/hIBM mouse model </plain></SENT>
