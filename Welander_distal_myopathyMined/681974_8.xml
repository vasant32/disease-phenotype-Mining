<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complete neurological examination was necessary in several members of the two last generations to discover the existence of the abnormalities of which they were unaware </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The propositus was the most affected member of the family iwth distal <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> of the upper and lower extremities and selective <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> of the deltoid muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition he had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002751'>kyphoscoliosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004684'>talipes valgus</z:hpo> and limitation of mobility of several joints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease was estimated as before the age of 2 when the child started walking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no progression of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical examination suggested a myopathic origin of the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A sural nerve biopsy was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Light-microscopy histochemical studies disclosed a predominance of type I fibres which were at the same time hypotrophic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subsarcolemmal deposits of mitochondria were present although they were scanty and of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ultrastructural appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In view of the morphological presentation it is postulated that this disease should be classified within the groups of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> accompanied by disproportion of fibres and selective <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of type I fibres </plain></SENT>
