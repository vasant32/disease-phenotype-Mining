<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Signs of muscle hyperexcitability and hyperckemia were observed in the youngest relatives but not motor symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Neurological examination was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> members of the family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsy sample was taken from the proband and DNA genomics was amplified for the two exons of Cav-3 by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the affected members and in three asymptomatic relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Signs of muscle hyperexcitability and hyperckemia were observed in the affected members from early ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cav-3 expression was greatly reduced in the sarcolemma of the proband's muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genetic studies revealed a G --&gt; A transition at nucleotide position 80 in exon 1 of the Cav-3 gene (c.80G&gt;A), generating a<z:chebi fb="17" ids="29952"> Arg --</z:chebi>&gt; Gln change at codon 27 (p.R27Q) of the amino acid chain in heterozygous state, while no mutation was found in unaffected members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Signs of muscle hyperexcitability and hyperckemia at early ages may predict the development of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> hand-involved <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> associated to Cav-3 mutation in the family reported herein </plain></SENT>
