<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Necrotic muscle fibers were few in number and did not appear to account for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo>, but the nuclear changes with myofibrillar degeneration followed by rimmed vacuole formation appeared to be the major reason for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100295'>muscle fiber atrophy</z:hpo> in DMRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the nuclear change in DMRV was related to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, we examined 15 muscle biopsy specimens immunohistochemically, and 7 of them ultrastructurally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The characteristic tubulofilamentous nuclear inclusions were found in 4 and the typical fragmented apoptotic nuclei in 3 of the 7 muscle biopsy samples examined by electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TUNEL-positive nuclei reflecting apoptotic DNA fragmentation were found in 13 of 15 biopsies ranging from a few to approximately 1.5% of myonuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath>-specific protein was expressed in the sarcoplasm of atrophic fibers in 13 biopsies both with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the apoptotic process plays a crucial role in myofibrillar degeneration followed by autophagocytosis, i.e., rimmed vacuole formation, in DMRV </plain></SENT>
