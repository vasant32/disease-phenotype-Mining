<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> (AR) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> includes, among others, two main clinical entities, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> (LGMDs) and the distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The former are characterized mainly by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle wasting</z:hpo> of the upper and lower limbs, with a wide range of clinical severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> has been demonstrated at the molecular level, since the genes for six AR forms have been cloned and/or have been mapped to 15q15.1 (LGMD2A), 2p12-16 (LGMD2B), 13q12 (LGMD2C), 17q12-q21.33 (LGMD2D),4q12 (LGMD2E), and 5q33-34 (LGMD2F) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The AR distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> originally included two subgroups, Miyoshi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, characterized mainly by extremely <z:hpo ids='HP_0003236'>elevated serum creatine kinase</z:hpo> (CK) activity and by a <z:mp ids='MP_0000752'>dystrophic muscle</z:mp> pattern, and Nonaka <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, which is distinct from the others because of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> to slightly elevated serum CK levels and a myopathic muscle pattern with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With regard to our unclassified AR LGMD families, analysis of the affected sibs from one of them (family LG61) revealed some clinical and laboratory findings (early involvement of the distal muscles, mildly elevated serum CK levels, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> in muscle biopsies) that usually are not observed in the analysis of patients with LGMD2A-LGMD2F </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the present investigation, through a genomewide search in family LG61, we demonstrated linkage of the allele causing this form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> to a 3-cM region on 17q11-12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suggest that this form, which, interestingly, clinically resembles AR <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152109" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KWS">Kugelberg-Welander disease</z:e>, should be classified as LGMD2G </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, our results indicate the existence of still another locus causing severe LGMD </plain></SENT>
