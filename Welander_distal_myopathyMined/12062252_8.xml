<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A dominantly inherited form of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in early childhood was first reported in a 4-generation Australian family in 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present report we provide further information on the clinical phenotype and natural history of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, and on the electromyogram and magnetic resonance imaging findings in affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pattern of muscle involvement was similar to that in the 'tibial' forms of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> such as the Finnish (Udd) and Markesbery-Griggs types, with additional involvement of the finger extensors and of some more proximal limb and neck muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> was earlier than in these other <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> were not found in biopsies from two affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Evidence of possible anticipation was found in one branch of the family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The gene locus for this <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> had been mapped to 14q11.2-q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The linkage region has been refined to a 24 cM region between D14S283 and D14S49 and mutations have been excluded in the PABP2 gene for oculopharyngeal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> which lies within this region </plain></SENT>
