<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Skeletal muscles obtained from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> with myofiber <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, including mdx dystrophic mice, plasmocid-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> in rats, and patients with Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, were examined immunohistochemically with anticathepsin-peroxidase conjugates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Strong reactions for lysosomal cysteine proteinases, which can degrade myofibrillar proteins, were demonstrated in macrophages invading and surrounding the necrotic areas and some degenerative myofibers and also in intramyofibral portions of atrophic fibers of dystrophic mice and humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and regenerating myofibers did not stain for lysosomal cathepsins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abnormal increases of cathepsins L and B were seen even in the early stage of plasmocid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> and in a 20-day-old young mdx mouse before infiltration of macrophages, suggesting that autodigestion by intramyofibral lysosomal proteinases is an important event before digestion of the necrotic fibers by macrophage proteinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Activation of the intramyofibral lysosomal system, as in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, was also observed in distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> without macrophageal infiltration (Am J Pathol 1986, 122:193-198) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, this activation seems to be an important, early response to myocellular damage </plain></SENT>
