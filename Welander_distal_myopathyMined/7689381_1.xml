<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, ultrastructural studies were carried out on biopsies from the soleus muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In muscle fibres from patients with early symptoms there was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> immunostaining for dystrophin, spectrin, desmin and Leu-19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the patients with long-standing symptoms, there was also a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> expression of dystrophin, and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> staining for spectrin and desmin was found in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sized muscle fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Occasionally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sized muscle fibres showed staining for Leu-19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased staining for spectrin and desmin and a strong Leu-19 staining was seen in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sized muscle fibres with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> and in atrophic fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased staining for spectrin, desmin and Leu-19 has been described in denervated muscle fibres and, thus, the present findings may support earlier findings of a neurogenic component in Welander distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the soleus muscle, ultrastructural muscle fibre abnormalities conformed to those in the anterior tibial muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Many <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> were observed which corresponded, at the ultrastructural level, to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003736'>autophagic vacuoles</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intranuclear and cytoplasmic filamentous inclusions of the same shape and diameter as in inclusion body <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo> were observed </plain></SENT>
