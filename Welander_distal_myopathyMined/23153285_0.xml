<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: About 9% of the offspring of a clinically healthy <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e>Ã©train boar named 'Campus' showed a progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002174'>postural tremor</z:hpo> called Campus syndrome (CPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Extensive backcross experiments suggested a dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo>, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> boar was believed to be a gonadal mosaic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A genome-scan mapped the disease-causing mutation to an 8 cM region of porcine chromosome 7 containing the MHY7 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> type 1 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD1</z:e>), a disease partially resembling CPS in pigs, has been associated with mutations in the MYH7 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The porcine MYH7 gene structure was predicted based on porcine reference genome sequence, porcine <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, and in comparison to the human ortholog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The gene structure was highly conserved with the exception of the first exon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutation analysis of a contiguous genomic interval of more than 22 kb spanning the complete MYH7 gene revealed an in-frame insertion within exon 30 of MYH7 (c.4320_4321insCCCGCC) which was perfectly associated with the disease phenotype and confirmed the dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mutation is predicted to insert two amino acids (p.Ala1440_Ala1441insProAla) in a very highly conserved region of the myosin tail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The boar 'Campus' was shown to be a germline and somatic mosaic as assessed by the presence of the mutant allele in seven different organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study illustrates the usefulness of recently established genomic resources in pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We have identified a spontaneous mutation in MYH7 as the causative mutation for CPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This paper describes the first case of a disorder caused by a naturally occurring mutation in the MYH7 gene of a non-human mammalian species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our study confirms the previous classification as a primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> and provides a defined large animal model for human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD1</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We provide evidence that the CPS mutation occurred during the early development of the boar 'Campus' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this study provides an example of germline mosaicism with an asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
