<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> patients had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> heart rate response to the Valsalva menoeuvre, indicating a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vagal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> initial heart rate response to the orthostatic position, indicating a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> function of the sympathetic nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main difference between the groups was found in the orthostatic position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> patients reacted with a greater increase in systolic blood pressure and a smaller heart rate increase than the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This suggests an altered peripheral vasomotor function, possibly with a more predominant activation of alfa than beta adrenergic receptors leading to vasoconstriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, a low forearm blood flow at rest and a les pronounced blood flow increase during the isometric handgrip were found in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This finding could also be explained by proneness to vasoconstriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that patients with Welander distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> have no signs of dysfunction of the peripheral autonomic nerves </plain></SENT>
