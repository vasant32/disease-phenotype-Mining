<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the patients with muscle fiber differentiation, the findings were similar to those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects; that is, there was a continuum between motor units which fired tonically at low rates and had a low axonal conduction velocity, and motor units which fired phasically at high rates and had a high axonal conduction velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the patients without muscle fiber differentiation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> motor units had intermediate firing properties and a low axonal conduction velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> pathologic states, the differentiation of the muscle fiber histochemistry remains only as long as the differentiation of the motor neurons remains </plain></SENT>
