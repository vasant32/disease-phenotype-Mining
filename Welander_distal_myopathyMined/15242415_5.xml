<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WDM</z:e> patients showed involvement of gastrocnemius, soleus, tibial anterior (TA) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL), as well as hamstrings and hip adductor muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TMD patients showed involvement of the TA and EDL muscles, and in some patients also hamstring and posterior compartment muscles of the legs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some patients showed asymmetry of muscle involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that muscle MRI examination proved to be very useful in the determination of the exact pattern of muscle involvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WDM</z:e> and TMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical testing using the Medical Research Council scale is not sensitive enough to establish the pattern of muscle involvement in focal muscle diseases </plain></SENT>
