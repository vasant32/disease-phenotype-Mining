<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy showed numerous degenerated mitochondria, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi>, or cell membranes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo>, but no evidence that these vacuoles engulfed and contained intact or partially disrupted myofibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining for myosin, alpha-actinin, and actin, however, was sometimes positive within the vacuoles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared to the control muscle, there was increased staining activity by calpain around the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> or in the cytoplasm of mainly atrophic fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The result seems to indicate an increase of calpain activity in these muscle fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that the myofibrils as well as mitochondria, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi>, or cell membranes in this <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> are degraded finally through a lysosomal autophagic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the breakdown of the myofibrils may be not initiated by lysosomal activation; rather it may be the result of extralysosomal processes such as the calpain system </plain></SENT>
