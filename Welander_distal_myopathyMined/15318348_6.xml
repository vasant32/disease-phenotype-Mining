<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aims were to characterize the pattern of dysferlin expression during myogenic cell differentiation and to assess possible differentially spliced isoforms of the DYSF gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Human primary myogenic cells express a splice variant of dysferlin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> lacking exon 17 (Delta17), together with full-length dysferlin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of human myoblasts, myotubes, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skeletal muscle showed that Delta17 expression inversely correlates with muscle differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indeed, Delta17 is progressively replaced by the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> as myoblast fusion proceeds, and it disappears in adult skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, Delta17 is the predominant dysferlin variant in mature peripheral nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the two proteins play different roles in myogenic cell differentiation and that dysferlin function in peripheral nerve might be accomplished by this novel isoform </plain></SENT>
