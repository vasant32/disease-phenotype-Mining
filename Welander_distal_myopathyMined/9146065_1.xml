<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We reported four patients with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> in the same family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>Muscle weakness</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> started in the lower extremities, especially in the calf muscle, and it extended to the upper extremities and pelvic muscles to a variable extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Facial and bulbar muscles were slightly involved in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The anterior tibial muscle tended to be better preserved than the calf muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>Cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> were absent in any case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase activity was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or mildly elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Skeletal muscle biopsies revealed myopathic process presenting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo>, eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions and/or subsarcolemmal mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructurally, cytoplasmic inclusions were composed of electron dense granular material and intermediate-sized filaments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were membranous whorls and myelin-like figures which were the characteristic findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry revealed accumulation of desmin, dystrophin and vimentin in the cytoplasm of degenerating muscle fibers and in the inclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In present patients, cardiac function was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and the tibialis anterior muscle was relatively spared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These features were different from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> rimmed-vacuolar <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with desmin storage described in previous reports </plain></SENT>
