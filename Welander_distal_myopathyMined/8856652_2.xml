<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was no family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026848" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">muscle disorder</z:e> and no clinical signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Extremely large variations in muscle fibre diameter (the size of some fibres exceeding 200-250 microns), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo>, necrotic fibres invaded by macrophages, atrophic fibres and perimysial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a wide range of antibodies raised against membrane- and cytoskeletal muscle proteins, granular desmin immunoreactivity was observed in muscle fibre lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no inflammatory parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of special interest was the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003736'>autophagic vacuoles</z:hpo> without 18-20 nm thick sarcoplasmic filaments and the presence of small aggregates of intermediate desmin-like filaments among a great diversity of ultrastructural findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The morphological differential diagnosis is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results stress the importance of combined immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy in the delineation of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DNA defects, however, still have to be identified which would improve the present classifications of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
