<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe the clinical features in 28 patients with dysferlin deficiency confirmed by muscle immunohistochemistry (IHC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A case series from a tertiary national referral center for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with classical phenotype of MM and LGMD2B underwent a thorough phenotypic characterization followed by muscle histopathological study including IHC for dysferlin deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 28 patients (20 men and eight women) presenting with manifestations of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> or LGMD2B and had absence of dysferlin staining on IHC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients presented predominantly with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> of Miyoshi type (MM) or proximal LGMD type and were diagnosed to have dysferlinopathy on IHC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients had the proximodistal form and two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> as tibial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main clinical features in these patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in late adolescence or early adulthood (mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> for MM was 22.0 +/- 6.7 years and for LGMD2B 19.4 +/- 5.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was early and predominant involvement of the posterior compartment muscles of the leg or proximal pelvic girdle muscles, dystrophic features with necrotic regeneration pattern without vacuoles on muscle biopsy and markedly <z:hpo ids='HP_0003236'>elevated serum creatine kinase</z:hpo> values with mean of 10033.8 +/- 9283 IU/l (range 402-27460) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Consanguinity was reported in 46.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of illness was 6.4 +/- 4.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Dysferlinopathies formed nearly one-fourth of our patients with LGMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our experience dysferlinopathies was not an uncommon form of LGMD </plain></SENT>
