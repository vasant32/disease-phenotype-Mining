<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ANO5 mutations cause distal and proximal phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here a follow-up muscle MRI study on five patients affected by distal form of anoctaminopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T1 weighted scans showed subsequent involvement of gastrocnemius medialis and soleus, hip adductors, hamstrings, gastrocnemius lateralis and quadriceps muscles, and later on tensor fascia lata, gluteus minimus and biceps brachii muscles, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The STIR weighted images showed in the early stages widely distributed hyperintense signals, myoedema, in the adductors, hamstrings, and quadriceps muscles, which at that time have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T1 signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed asymmetry of muscle involvement both clinically and on muscle imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The progression of muscle involvement was relatively slow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the pattern of muscle involvement seen in patients with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with anoctamin 5 mutations (MMD3) is typical and can thus be useful during the differential diagnosis process allowing for a more targeted molecular approach </plain></SENT>
