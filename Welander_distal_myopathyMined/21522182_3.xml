<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dysferlin gene mutations cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (LGMD) 2B, Miyoshi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (MM) and distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> of the anterior tibialis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Considering that a secondary Dysferlin reduction has also been described in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo>, our original goal was to identify cases with a Dysferlin deficiency without dysferlin gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dysferlin gene is huge, composed of 55 exons that span 233 140 bp of genomic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed a thorough mutation analysis in 65 LGMD/MM patients with ≤20% Dysferlin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The screening was exhaustive, as we sequenced both genomic DNA and cDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When required, we used other methods, including real-time PCR, long PCR and array CGH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, we were able to recognize the primary involvement of the dysferlin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We identified 38 novel mutation types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some of these, such as a dysferlin gene duplication, could have been missed by conventional screening strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nonsense-mediated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> decay was evident in six cases, in three of which both alleles were only detectable in the genomic DNA but not in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among a wide spectrum of novel gene defects, we found the first example of a 'nonstop' mutation causing a dysferlinopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study presents the first direct and conclusive evidence that an amount of Dysferlin ≤20% is pathogenic and always caused by primary dysferlin gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This demonstrates the high specificity of a marked reduction of Dysferlin on western blot and the value of a comprehensive molecular approach for LGMD2B/MM diagnosis </plain></SENT>
