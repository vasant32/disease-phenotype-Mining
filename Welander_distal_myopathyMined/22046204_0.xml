<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In fact, some <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> (CMDs) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> (LGMDs) are caused by point mutations identified in six glycosyltransferase genes which are likely to target different steps along the posttranslational "O-glycosylation route" leading to a fully decorated and functional α-DG subunit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indeed, hypoglycosylation of α-DG is thought to represent a major pathological event, in that it could reduce the DG's ability to bind the basement membrane components, thus leading to sarcolemmal instability and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to set up an efficient standard immunological protocol, taking advantage of a wide panel of antibodies, we have analyzed the two DG subunits in a small cohort of adult dystrophic patients, whom an extensive medical examination had already clinically classified as affected by LGMD (5), Miyoshi (1) or distal (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence analysis of skeletal muscle tissue sections revealed a proper sarcolemmal localization of the DG subunits in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, Western blot analysis of lectin enriched skeletal muscle samples revealed an abnormal glycosylation of α-DG in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our work reinforces the notion that a careful immunological and biochemical analysis of the two DG subunits should be always considered as a prerequisite for the identification of new putative cases of dystroglycanopathy </plain></SENT>
