<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Seven patients with Welander distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> were subjected to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lower extremity, and muscle biopsies of the tibialis anterior, soleus and vastus lateralis muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MRI revealed abnormalities in both the anterior and posterior compartments of the lower leg in three of the patients, and in only the posterior compartment in the rest of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No MRI abnormalities were found in either the proximal muscles of the leg or in the peroneal or posterior tibial muscle groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Affected muscles had T1- and T2-values indicating a replacement of muscle fibres with fat tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsies showed pathological changes varying from slight to severe in tibialis anterior and soleus muscles in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No muscle fibre abnormalities were seen in the vastus lateralis muscle in any of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In accordance with earlier reports from patients with Welander distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, there was <z:mp ids='MP_0000749'>muscle degeneration</z:mp> of tibialis anterior muscles corresponding to the <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of dorsal extension of the feet, but also degeneration in the muscles of the posterior compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients did not, however, show any clinical signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> related to posterior muscle groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There is no evidence of involvement of proximal muscles of the leg clinically, with MRI or in muscle biopsies </plain></SENT>
