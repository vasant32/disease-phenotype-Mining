<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pedigree also included patients whose symptoms resembled another phenotype, classical <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Extensive linkage analysis was carried out in this complex pedigree using 157 highly polymorphic DNA markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of the presence of two phenotypes, several <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> models were used in linkage analysis studies to allow for the possibility of intrafamilial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results summarize information from over 10,000 genotypings and exclude several known loci for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that TMD may be caused by a mutation in a previously unknown locus for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
