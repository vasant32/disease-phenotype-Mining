<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A case of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> was studied with MRI, which showed a characteristic distribution of the affected muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 41-year-old man who presented a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> in his lower legs starting 11 years previously was admitted to our hospital of further investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological examinations showed muscular <z:mp ids='MP_0005150'>wasting</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> in the neck flexors, the flexors of the forearm, the flexors and adductors of the thigh and the extensors of the lower legs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Needle electromyography showed a myopathic pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsy revealed a variation in fiber size, an increase in internal nuclei, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_591'>fatty infiltration</z:mpath> and scattered <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> in a histochemical study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> contained numerous lamellar bodies and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>T1 and T2 weighted MRI showed high signals in the m. adductor of thigh m. biceps femoris, m. semimembranosus, m. semitendinosus, m. tibialis anterior, m. tibialis posterior, m. extensor digitorum longus, m. extensor digitorum brevis, m. peroneus, and m. gastrocnemius </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were three merits for the application of MRI to distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, (1) easy detection of the affected muscles as fatty change is expressed with a high signal intensity by MRI, (2) no affection by the presence of bones in MRI, and (3) the possibility to have a transverse section and a sagittal and coronal section in MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this case MRI was very useful to detect the affected muscles and to observe the progress </plain></SENT>
