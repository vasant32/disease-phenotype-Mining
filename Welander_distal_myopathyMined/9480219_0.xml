<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A unique inbred Avar family from an isolate of the Dagestan highland was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unusual phenotypic expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> was revealed in 12 members of this family from three generations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Limb-girdle (proximal) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (LGMD) was detected in nine patients, while the other three patients displayed typical distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genetic linkage analysis with several candidate loci determining various forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> allowed a gene for this polymorphic syndrome to be assigned to chromosome 2p13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In spite of the difference in clinical manifestation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients appeared to be homozygous for a unique haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This implies the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> effect and proves the same genetic basis of LGMD and DM in the family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recombination analysis showed that the centromeric and telomeric ends of the gene region are marked with D2S2111 and D2S327, respectively (genetic distance &lt; 1 cM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This region is overlapped by two larger regions in which the genes for LGMD type 2B (LGMD2B) and Miyoshi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> were recently mapped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complex analysis of clinical and genetic data indicated that LGMD2B, Miyoshi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, and the revealed polymorphic syndrome may represent allelic variants of 2p13-linked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
