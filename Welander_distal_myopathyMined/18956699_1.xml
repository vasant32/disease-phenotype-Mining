<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To clarify the clinical and pathological features and prognosis of Chinese patients with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> (DMRV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical data of 17 Chinese DMRV patients with the courses of disease of 1-21 years, 5 males and 12 females, aged 28.9 (19-41), were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biopsy of muscle specimens of 17 Chinese DMRV patients were summarized retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Muscle specimens were collected from the biceps brachii, tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, or quadriceps femoris and underwent light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight muscle specimens underwent electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>11 patients were followed up for 4 months to 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> ranged from 5 to 40 years (averaging 23 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002460'>Distal muscle weakness</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the lower extremities, especially anterior tibial muscle, was predominant in the early stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Proximal and trunk muscles were involved in the advanced stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Quadriceps femoris were slightly involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The striking and characteristic pathological finding was the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> in atrophic muscle fibers with little evidence of necrotic or regenerative processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy showed accumulation of myeloid structure and cytoplasmic or intranuclear tubofilamentous inclusion bodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of the leg muscle appeared as initial symptoms, severe generalized skeletal muscle involvement with sparing of the facial, extraocular, bulbar, intercostals, and diaphragm muscles was recognized in the advanced stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The patients became non-ambulant about 7-10 years after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>They lost the self-care ability and the quality of their life was rather low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The clinical and pathological features of the Chinese DMRV patients are basically similar to those of the Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>With the disease progressing slowly, the patients become wheelchair-bound and lose the self-care ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>As to daily life, the prognosis of DMRV is extremely poor </plain></SENT>
