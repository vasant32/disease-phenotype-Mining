<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Linkage to the tibial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (TMD) locus 2q31 was not evident at first because of incomplete disease penetrance in a 50-year-old asymptomatic family member </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An abnormal tibialis anterior muscle biopsy established her subclinical status and linkage of the family to the TMD locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutation analysis showed a disease-specific, heterozygous point mutation in the last exon, Mex6, of the titin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is the third mutation found in TMD and the second European family with TMD outside the Finnish population, suggesting that titinopathies may occur in various populations </plain></SENT>
