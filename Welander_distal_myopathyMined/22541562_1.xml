<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, now that genome-wide approaches can be applied to single multiplex consanguineous families, the identification of genes harboring disease-causing mutations by autozygosity mapping is expanding rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we have mapped a disease locus in a consanguineous Pakistani family affected by ID and distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We genotyped family members on genome-wide SNP microarrays and used the data to determine a single 2.5 Mb homozygosity-by-descent (HBD) locus in region 5p15.32-p15.31; we identified the missense change c.2035G&gt;A (p.Gly679Arg) at a conserved residue within NSUN2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This gene encodes a methyltransferase that catalyzes formation of 5-methylcytosine at C34 of tRNA-leu(CAA) and plays a role in spindle assembly during mitosis as well as chromosome segregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In mouse brains, we show that NSUN2 localizes to the nucleolus of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effects of the mutation were confirmed by the transfection of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutant constructs into cells and subsequent immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We show that mutation to arginine at this residue causes NSUN2 to fail to localize within the nucleolus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ID combined with a unique profile of comorbid features presented here makes this an important genetic discovery, and the involvement of NSUN2 highlights the role of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> methyltransferase in human neurocognitive development </plain></SENT>
