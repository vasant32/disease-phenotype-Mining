<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Numerous cofilin homologues have been characterized in various organisms including mammals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In mice, a ubiquitously expressed cofilin (CFL1) and a skeletal muscle specific cofilin (CFL2) have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we identified and characterized a human CFL2 gene localized on chromosome 14, with high homology to murine CFL2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we provide evidence for differentially spliced CFL2 transcripts (CFL2a and CFL2b) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CFL2b is expressed predominantly in human skeletal muscle and heart, while CFL2a is expressed in various tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genetic defects of CFL2 were excluded for one human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026848" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">muscle disorder</z:e>, the chromosome 14 linked distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD1</z:e>, and shown to be only possible to be a rare cause of another, nemaline <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a mouse model of mechanically induced muscle damage the changes of cofilin expression were monitored during the first 10 days of regeneration, with dephosphorylated CFL2 being the major isoform at later stages of <z:mp ids='MP_0000750'>muscle regeneration</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A similar predominance of dephosphorylated CFL2 was observed in chronically regenerating dystrophin-deficient muscles of Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the CFL2 isoform may play an important role in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> muscle function and <z:mp ids='MP_0000750'>muscle regeneration</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
