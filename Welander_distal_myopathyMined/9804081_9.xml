<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a previous report we suggested that muscle fibers in distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> (DMRV) were degraded by both lysosomal proteolysis (cathepsins) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-dependent, nonlysosomal proteolysis (calpain) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given recent evidence of abnormal ubiquitin accumulation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo>, we examined the role of the ATP-ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway (proteasomes) in myofiber degradation in this <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, proteasomes (26S) were located in the cytoplasm in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human muscle, but the staining intensity was weak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantitative analysis showed more reactivity for proteasomes in DMRV muscles and, to a lesser extent, in muscles from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085655" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polymyositis</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007354'>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In DMRV, proteasomes often were located within or on the rim of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo>, and in the cytoplasm of atrophic fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ubiquitin accumulation was marked within <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> and was seen less extensively in the cytoplasm of atrophic fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The latter proteins colocalized well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In other diseased muscles, proteasomes and ubiquitin showed a positive reaction in the atrophic or necrotic fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results indicate increased proteasome and ubiquitin in these muscle fibers as well as in other diseased muscle fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the ATP-ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway as well as the nonlysosomal calpain and the lysosomal proteolytic pathway may participate in the muscle fiber degradation in DMRV </plain></SENT>
