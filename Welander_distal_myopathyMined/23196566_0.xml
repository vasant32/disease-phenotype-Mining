<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease is caused by mutations, mostly missense, in GNE gene that encodes a protein with two enzymatic activities in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> biosynthetic pathway: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16264">UDP-GlcNAc</z:chebi> 2-epimerase and ManNAc kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> production is reduced in patients' cells and cells are hyposialylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This hyposialylation status can be recovered by simply giving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, myopathic manifestations were virtually completely suppressed by oral administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> in our model mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar efficacy was seen also by ManNAc, precursor of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi>, or sialyllactose, a conjugate form of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based upon these in vitro and in vivo results, phase I clinical trial for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> supplementation therapy for human patients was performed in October 2010-June 2011 in Japan and in September 2011-April 2012 in the US, the latter using slow release tablets of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Natural history of the patients needs to be established for precise evaluation of the efficacy in the near future phase II clinical trial </plain></SENT>
