<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To characterize the clinical spectrum, we investigated the characteristics of 31 Korean dysferlinopathy patients confirmed by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean age of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 22.23 Â± 7.34 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase (CK) was highly increased (4- to 101-fold above <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pathological findings of muscle specimens showed nonspecific dystrophic features and frequent inflammatory cell infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Muscle imaging studies showed fatty atrophic changes dominantly in the posterolateral muscles of the lower limb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients with dysferlinopathy were classified by initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo>: fifteen patients with Miyoshi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> phenotype (MM), thirteen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> 2B phenotype (LGMD2B), two patients with proximodistal phenotype, and one asymptomatic patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between LGMD2B and MM groups in terms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age, serum CK levels and pathological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dysferlinopathy patients usually have <z:hpo ids='HP_0011462'>young adult onset</z:hpo> and high serum CK levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of clinical presentations and pathologic findings upon routine staining makes it difficult to diagnose dysferlinopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These limitations make immunohistochemistry currently the most important method for the diagnosis of dysferlinopathy </plain></SENT>
