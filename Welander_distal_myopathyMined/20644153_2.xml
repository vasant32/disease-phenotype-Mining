<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By Western blot (WB) analysis, we have previously shown that in h-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBM</z:e>/DMRV muscle, the neural cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule (NCAM) has increased electrophoretic mobility that reflects reduced sialylation of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify patients with h-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBM</z:e>/DMRV with atypical clinical or pathologic phenotype using NCAM analysis and the possible cellular mechanism associated with the overall abnormal sialylation of NCAM observed in this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: WB analysis of NCAM was performed on muscle biopsies of 84 patients with an uncharacterized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026848" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">muscle disorder</z:e> who were divided in the following 2 groups: 1) 46 patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003701'>proximal muscle weakness</z:hpo> in whom the main <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> syndromes had been ruled out; and 2) 38 patients with a distal distribution of <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> in whom a neurogenic affection had been excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients in whom a reduced sialylation of NCAM was suspected were studied for the presence of GNE mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 3 patients, we found that NCAM had increased electrophoretic mobility, thus suggesting an abnormal sialylation of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The genetic study demonstrated that they <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> carried pathogenic GNE mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies demonstrated that hyposialylated NCAM, showing increased electrophoretic mobility on WB, is expressed by nonregenerating fibers in h-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBM</z:e>/DMRV muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: WB analysis of NCAM may be instrumental in the identification of h-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBM</z:e>/DMRV with atypical clinical or pathologic features </plain></SENT>
