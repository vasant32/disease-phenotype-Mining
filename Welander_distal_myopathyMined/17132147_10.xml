<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> muscle diseases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> type 2B (LGMD2B) and Miyoshi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (MM), are caused by mutations in the dysferlin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These mutations result in poor ability to repair cell membrane damage, which is suggested to be the cause for this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, many patients who share clinical features with MM-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> do not carry mutations in dysferlin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To understand the basis of MM that is not due to mutations in dysferlin gene, we analyzed cells from patients in one such family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these patients, we found no defects in several potential candidates - annexin A2, caveolin-3, myoferlin and the MMD2 locus on chromosome 10p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar to dysferlinopathy, these cells also exhibit membrane repair defects and the severity of the defect correlated with severity of their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, unlike dysferlinopathy, none of the conventional membrane repair pathways are defective in these patient cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results add to the existing evidence that cell membrane repair defect may be responsible for MM-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and indicate that a previously unsuspected genetic lesion that affects cell membrane repair pathway is responsible for the disease in the non-dysferlin MM patients </plain></SENT>
