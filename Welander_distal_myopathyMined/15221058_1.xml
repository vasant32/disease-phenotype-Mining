<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of the present report is to emphasize that the source of elevated transaminase levels, although usually indicative of hepatocellular damage, can also be of extrahepatic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 42-year-old female presented with a moderate persistent elevation of the transaminases glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT; synonym: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> aminotransferase [AST]) and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT; synonym: alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) in blood without any apparent clinical symptoms of liver affection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the course of further diagnostics for clarification of a suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e>, a markedly elevated activity of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase was found which, in concert with results from myography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and analysis of muscle biopsies, suggested the tentative diagnosis of a distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> type Miyoshi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was confirmed by identification of the underlying mutation in the dysferlin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The course of the disease has been slowly but steadily progressive; there is no therapeutic option at present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relevance of molecular genetic analyses in the diagnostic procedure for distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo>, in particular dysferlinopathy, is discussed and the characteristics of this disease are summarized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the case of persistent elevations of the serum transaminases GOT and GPT without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disorder</z:e>, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> has to be taken into account as a potential extrahepatic source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In order to avoid needless nondirected expensive investigations and to prevent a delay in diagnostics, activity of serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase should be determined which is moderately to strongly elevated in the case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If, in particular, a dysferlinopathy is supposed, the underlying mutation should be identified to confirm the diagnosis and as a basis for current and future therapeutic interventions </plain></SENT>
