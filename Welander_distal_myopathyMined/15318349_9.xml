<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the CAV3 gene result in certain <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal-dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inherited diseases</z:e>, namely, rippling muscle disease (RMD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> type 1C (LGMD1C), distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, and hyperCKemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report we show that a previously reported family with RMD has a mutation in the CAV3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Affected individuals had either a characteristic RMD phenotype, a combination of RMD and LGMD1C phenotypes, or a LGMD1C phenotype, but one mutation carrier was asymptomatic at age 86 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>phenotypic variability</z:hpo> associated with mutations in CAV3 has been reported previously but only in a few families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is important to remember the significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>phenotypic variability</z:hpo> associated with CAV3 mutations when counseling families with these mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations also suggest the presence of factors independent of the CAV3 gene locus that modify phenotype </plain></SENT>
