<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently the gene was discovered to be mapped to chromosome 9, the same region as in familial inclusion body <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (rimmed vacuole <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> sparing the quadriceps) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease was in young adults 20-40 years of age, averaging 26 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The disease was progressive and most of the patients became non-ambulant within 12 years after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The striking and common pathologic finding was the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> in muscle fibers with little evidence of necrotic or regenerative processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nuclear change with tubulofilamentous inclusions probably induces focal myofibrillar degeneration which activates the lysosomal system, resulting in active autophagocytosis and myelin body formation, i.e. rimmed vacuole formation </plain></SENT>
