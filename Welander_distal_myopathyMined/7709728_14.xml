<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In 11 patients with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with rimmed vacuole formation (DMRV), a well-known autosomal recessively inherited disorder, the rimmed vacuole formation appears to be the main pathological change accounting for the progressive muscle fiber degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To gain a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the vacuole formation, we applied <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34653">Congo red</z:chebi> and immunohistochemical stains to muscle biopsies from these patients and the results were compared with those of patients with inclusion body <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The vacuoles in DMRV contained Congophilic amyloid material and deposits immunoreactive for beta-amyloid protein, both the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi> and COOH termini of beta-amyloid protein precursor, ubiquitin, and tau protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results were similar to those seen in our present cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBM</z:e> as well as in previously reported cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, there may be no pathogenetic differences in the formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> in DMRV and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the degenerative process involved in rimmed vacuole formation in various diseases may share a common pathogenetic mechanism with that in amyloid-plaque formation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> brain as has been proposed previously </plain></SENT>
