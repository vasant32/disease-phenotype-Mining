<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Light microscopy showed mild to moderate variations in fiber size, numerous dense membranous bodies and vacuoles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The vacuoles were ringed by material that was intensely basophilic in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin preparations, resembling <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> in the muscle fibers of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Segmental degradation or <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was often observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 3H-leucine uptake by myofibrillar and soluble sarcoplasmic fractions in CQ-treated muscles was the same as in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The significant increases in lysosomal (cathepsin B &amp; L, B and D) proteases and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi> occurred in the earlier stages of CQ-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, when hardly any <z:hpo ids='HP_0003736'>autophagic vacuoles</z:hpo> or dense bodies were observable by light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the over-development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003736'>autophagic vacuoles</z:hpo> and the significant increases in lysosomal protease activity in muscle tissues may be important in the development of the focal degradation and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of CQ-treated muscles </plain></SENT>
