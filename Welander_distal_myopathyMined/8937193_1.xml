<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 in control muscles was positive mainly in nuclear membrane and cytoplasm in type 2 fibers (especially type 2B fibers), and negative in type 1 fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo>, it was not expressed in type 2C (regenerating) fibers, and its expression in atrophic fibers such as forming pyknotic nuclear clumps was strong </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0009071'>inflammatory myopathies</z:hpo>, expression was observed in infiltrating lymphocytes, and especially in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011633" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatomyositis</z:e> in atrophic fibers facing perimysium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0003737'>mitochondrial myopathies</z:hpo>, the positivity was observed only in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003200'>ragged-red fibers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In muscles of neurogenic disorders, both small angulated fibers and atrophic grouped fibers were strongly positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis using anti-Bcl-2 antibody showed a single band at 26 kDa in control and diseased skeletal muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to immunostaining of Fas antigen in serial sections, both Bcl-2 and Fas were expressed in same atrophic fibers in distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In myotonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath>, they were often expressed in type 2 fibers containing internal nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In carriers of Duchenne <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath>, Fas-positive but Bcl-2 negative fibers were observed in same dystrophin-negative fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, expression of Bcl-2 in skeletal muscles might suggest that Bcl-2 plays a role on surviving muscle fibers </plain></SENT>
