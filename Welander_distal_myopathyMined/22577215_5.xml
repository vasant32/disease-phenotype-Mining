<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In 2001, we described an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> characterized by neuromuscular ventilatory failure in ambulant patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we describe the underlying genetic basis for the disorder, and we define the neuromuscular, respiratory and radiological phenotype in a study of 31 mutation carriers followed for up to 31 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A combination of genome-wide linkage and whole exome sequencing revealed the likely causal genetic variant in the titin (TTN) gene (g.274375T&gt;C; p.Cys30071Arg) within a shared haplotype of 2.93 Mbp on chromosome 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This segregated with the phenotype in 21 individuals from the original family, nine subjects in a second family with the same highly selective pattern of muscle involvement on magnetic resonance imaging and a third familial case with a similar phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparing the mutation carriers revealed novel features not apparent in our original report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentation included predominant distal, proximal or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002747'>respiratory muscle weakness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> was highly variable, from early adulthood, and including a mild phenotype in advanced age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>Muscle weakness</z:hpo> was earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and more severe in the lower extremities in nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven patients also had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003327'>axial muscle weakness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Respiratory function studies demonstrated a gradual deterioration over time, reflecting the progressive nature of this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was not present in any of our patients despite up to 31 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance muscle imaging was performed in 21 affected patients and revealed characteristic abnormalities with semitendinosus involvement in 20 of 21 patients studied, including 3 patients who were presymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic muscle histopathology most frequently revealed eosinophilic inclusions (inclusion bodies) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo>, but was non-specific in a minority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings have important clinical implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This disease should be considered in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> proximal or distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002878'>early respiratory failure</z:hpo>, even in the presence of non-specific muscle pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Muscle magnetic resonance imaging findings are characteristic and should be considered as an initial investigation, and if positive should prompt screening for mutations in TTN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>With 363 exons, screening TTN presented a major challenge until recently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, whole exome sequencing provides a reliable cost-effective approach, providing the gene of interest is adequately captured </plain></SENT>
