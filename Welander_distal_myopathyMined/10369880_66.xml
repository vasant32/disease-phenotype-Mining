<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The striated muscle sarcomeres are highly organized structures composed of actin (thin) and myosin (thick) filaments that slide past each other during contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The integrity of sarcomeres is controlled by a set of structural proteins, among which are titin, a giant molecule that contains several immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains and associates with thin and thick filaments, and [alpha]-actinin, an actin cross-linking protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in several sarcomeric and sarcolemmal proteins have been shown to result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the disease genes underlying several disease forms remain to be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a novel 57 kDa cytoskeletal protein, myotilin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Its N-terminal sequence is unique, but the C-terminal half contains two Ig-like domains homologous to titin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Myotilin is expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle, it co-localizes with [alpha]-actinin in the sarcomeric I--bands and directly interacts with [alpha]-actinin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The human myotilin gene maps to chromosome 5q31 between markers AFM350yB1 and D5S500 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The locus of a dominantly inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (LGMD1A) resides in an overlapping narrow segment, and a new type of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with vocal cord and pharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> (VCPMD) has been mapped to the same locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The muscle specificity and apparent role as a sarcomeric structural protein raise the possibility that defects in the myotilin gene may cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
