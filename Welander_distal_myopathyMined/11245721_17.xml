<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify calpain-3 or dysferlin deficiency in a large cohort of patients with as yet unclassified LGMD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> through candidate protein analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors' muscle biopsy database search identified 407 candidate muscle biopsies with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> dystrophin and sarcoglycan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Calpain-3 and dysferlin were studied by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Combined calpain-3 and dysferlin Western blot analysis identified calpain-3 deficiency in 66 (16%) muscle biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 31 cases (47%), the protein was absent, and in 35 (53%), it was severely reduced in amount (3 to 50% of control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dysferlin deficiency was found in 26 (6.5%) muscle biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 9, the protein was absent (35%), and in 17 (65%), it was severely reduced in amount (traces to 20% of control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight percent (53/191) of patients with LGMD phenotype had calpain-3 deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixty percent (21/35) of patients with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> had dysferlin deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Dysferlin immunohistochemistry showed, in the completely dysferlin-deficient patients, absent reaction at the sarcolemma but positive nuclear membrane labeling and, in the partially dysferlin-deficient patients, scattered granular positive cytoplasmic areas and diffuse reaction in regenerating fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: About 25% of previously unclassified <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> cases are due to calpain-3 or dysferlin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033626" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that immunoblot analysis may be used to define patients for calpain-3 and dysferlin gene mutation studies </plain></SENT>
