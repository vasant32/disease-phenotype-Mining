<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the phenotype variability associated with the specific C-terminal M-line titin mutation known to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, tibial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (TMD; MIM 600334), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> 2J (LGMD2J) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three hundred eighty-six individuals were genotyped for the Finnish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutation in titin (FINmaj) causing TMD/LGMD2J </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred seven patients were heterozygous for the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among these patients, 189 (91%) had a more common phenotype compatible with the classic description of TMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, 18 (9%) had unusual phenotypes such as proximal leg or posterior lower leg <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> even at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients were confirmed homozygotes representing the LGMD2J phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These homozygotes were half of the eight LGMD patients previously described in the original large consanguineous kindred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Large variability of phenotypic expression caused by just one mutation, the Finnish FINmaj, suggests that no certain phenotype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> can be excluded from being caused by mutated titin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Yet unknown homozygous or compound heterozygous titin mutations without phenotype in the heterozygote carriers may be responsible for undetermined recessive MD and LGMD </plain></SENT>
