<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To describe the long-term follow-up of a cohort of 22 patients with the Miyoshi phenotype of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (MMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A long-term clinical follow-up study was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were genotyped for dysferlin (MMD1) or anoctamin 5 (MMD3) mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients also underwent cardiological evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 10 patients with MMD1, eight patients with MMD3 and four patients with linkage to chromosome 10 (MMD2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients deteriorated over 5.7 (range: 4.2-6.6) years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>Weakness</z:mp> increased significantly (P &lt; 0.035) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but the neck extensor, serratus anterior, and wrist flexor and extensor muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The decrease of strength was most pronounced in the iliopsoas (15%), toe extensors (15%), anterior tibial and peroneal muscles (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with MMD1 showed early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease (mean 22 years) with typically symmetrical distribution of <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> starting in the calf muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with MMD1 had a worse clinical course compared with patients with MMD3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ninety percent of the former had to make use of a wheelchair within 15 years after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease, whereas patients with MMD3, who have a significantly later <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (mean 35 years) of asymmetrical calf <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, remained ambulant during the first 15 years of their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the patients with MMD2 became fully confined to the wheelchair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>None of the 22 MMD phenotype patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MMD1 have a worse clinical course compared with patients with MMD3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There are no cardiological abnormalities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> MMD categories </plain></SENT>
