<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The proband, a 17-year-old boy, was admitted to our department because of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003698'>difficulty in standing</z:hpo> on heel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Physical examination revealed a marked <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of bilateral lower legs, especially anterior tibial muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patellar and Achilles tendon reflexes were abolished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo> and moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> were noted on abdominal echogram and CT scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase, GOT and GPT were markedly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no abnormal findings in thyroid function, serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> analysis and serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> level after ischemic forearm exercise test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EMG of anterior tibial and calf muscles showed a mixture of myogenic and neurogenic patterns and biopsy specimen of calf muscle was compatible with a dystrophic change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Liver biopsy specimen revealed no noticeable change except a slight ballooning of hepatocytes in light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, electron microscopic examination showed a marked increase of intracellular vesicles and enlarged smooth ER in which low-density, cotton-like materials were contained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In family study, both his father and paternal uncle were also affected with advanced scapuloperoneal-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> associated with a marked elevation of serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The disorder differs from Miyoshi's distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, which shows an early involvement of flexor muscles in lower extremities and is inherited as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal-recessive</z:hpo> trait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo> in this case remains to be elucidated, the special findings on electron microscopic study imply the possibility of some unknown <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorder</z:e> involving both muscle and liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This disease seems to be a new type of scapuloperoneal-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, probably having an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal-dominant inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
