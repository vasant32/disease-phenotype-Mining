<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Studies of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> (DMRV) revealed that most patients had mutations in the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the correlation between GNE mutations and clinical features was not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PURPOSES: To report the correlation between the clinical features and genetic analysis of DMRV patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical presentations, histopathological findings, image studies, and genetic analyses of two patients with DMRV from a Taiwanese family were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two compound heterozygous mutations, Ile 241 Ser and Arg 246 Gln, located in the epimerase domain, were identified in both patients, who were of the same generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the elder sister showed a progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> course with severe quadriceps and trunk muscle involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The compound heterozygous mutations in the epimerase domain of the GNE gene are important in the severe phenotype of DMRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms leading to this phenotypic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> still remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
