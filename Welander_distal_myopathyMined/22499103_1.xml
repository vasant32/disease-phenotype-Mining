<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Mutations in the anoctamin 5 gene (ANO5) have been recently identified.They cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (LGMD2L) and Miyoshi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical findings of four unrelated patients are reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutation detection was performed by direct sequencing of the ANO5 exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified four novel mutations in the ANO5 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one patient, a novel homozygous mutation (c.1965G&gt;C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In three patients, the recurrent heterozygous exon 5 c.191dupA mutation is combined with other variants to form a compound heterozygous state: in two cases, novel splice site mutations in intron 5 (c.295-1G&gt;A) and in intron 14 (c.1407+5G&gt;A), and in one case, a novel missense mutation in exon 4 (c.172C&gt;T) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The cases reported here should help to better understand the important role of mutation screening in the ANO5 gene in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and very high CK levels </plain></SENT>
