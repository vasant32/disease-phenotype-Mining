<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Precisely defining specific categories is a challenge because of overlapping clinical phenotypes, making it difficult to decide which of the many known causative genes to screen in individual cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we define the distinguishing magnetic resonance imaging findings in myotilin <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> by studying 8 genealogically unrelated cases due to the same point mutation in TTID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Proximally, the vastii, biceps femoris and semimembranosus were involved with sparing of gracilis and sartorius </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Distally, soleus, gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, extensor hallicus and extensor digitorum were involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This pattern contrasts with other distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> and provides further support for the role of imaging in the clinical investigation of muscle disease </plain></SENT>
