<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anoctamin 5 is supposed to be a putative calcium-activated <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report five German patients (four index patients) with muscle <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> due to mutations in the ANO5 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of the ANO5 exons 5, 13 and 20 was performed to screen for a common c.191dupA mutation and two other reported mutations (c.1295C&gt;G and p.R758C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The whole coding region of the ANO5 gene was sequenced to identify new mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phenotypically, three patients showed LGMD and one patient Miyoshi type distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One sibling had asymptomatic hyperCKemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 64, 38 and 40 years in patients with LGMD and 23 years in the patient with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The four symptomatic patients showed remarkable asymmetric muscle involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was marked CK elevation (11 to 30 times) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy showed multifocal gaps in the sarcolemmal membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients harboured the common c.191dupA mutation in at least one allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients with LGMD were homozygous and the third patient and his asymptomatic sister were compound heterozygous for the c.191dupA mutation and a novel p.T548I mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The patient with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> harboured the p.R758C mutation in the second allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the ANO5 gene seem to be a relatively common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> in Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> or asymptomatic hyperCKemia can occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Clinically, asymmetric manifestation is typical </plain></SENT>
