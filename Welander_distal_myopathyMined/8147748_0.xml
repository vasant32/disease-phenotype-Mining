<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe eight cases of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> (five male and three female patients) whose symptoms started at the age of 10 in five and 20 in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Symptoms started in the distal muscles of lower limbs, following decreased strength in the distal portion of upper limbs, and later on involvement of proximal muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum enzymes increase was slight in five, moderate in one, and important in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EMG suggested primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> in four, denervation in two, and was mixed type in another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsies showed features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> and denervation in two cases, active <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> in five, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> in another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four cases had vacuoles with positive acid phosphatase reaction and in two cases <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six cases had increase of focal phosphatase acid in the muscle fibers suggesting a lissome participation in the pathogenesis of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two cases were classified as recessive autosomal distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (Welander variant), two recessive autosomal (Miyoshi type), two <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> with rimmed vacuole (Myzuzawa and Nonaka type), and two as miscellany type </plain></SENT>
