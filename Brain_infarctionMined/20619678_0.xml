<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> admitted to Nippon Medical School Hospital were consecutively recruited and grouped into 3 subtypes based on the Trial of Org 10172 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Treatment (TOAST) classification: cardioembolism (group CE), large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (group LAA), and small-vessel occlusion (group SVO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects underwent carotid ultrasonography to determine maximum intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>), maximum systolic velocity (Vmax), minimum diastolic velocity (Vmin), mean velocity, and pulsatility index (PI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Carotid parameters that differed among subtypes were statistically identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 138 patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intergroup comparisons revealed that the Vmin of the affected side was significantly lower in group LAA than in group SVO (mean±SD, 0.12±0.05 m/s vs 0.15±0.05 m/s; P=.02) and the Vmin of the mean of both sides was lower in group LAA than in group SVO (0.12±0.04 vs 0.16±0.05; P=.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that the PI of the affected side was a useful adjunct to discriminate between groups SVO and LAA (odds ratio=2.94; P=.03, group SVO as control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis found that the Vmin of the affected side was the most useful parameter for discriminating between group SVO and group LAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The PI and the Vmin of the affected side were found to differ among <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes, and thus these may be useful parameters for discriminating among <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
