<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One problem is the lack of a well established correspondence between WCST errors and specific cognitive or neural processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The conventional scoring of non-perseverative WCST errors does not discriminate between errors related to the efficient test of hypotheses during set shifting ('efficient errors'), and random failures to maintain set ('random errors') </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This inherent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> in the non-perseverative error score probably minimizes the relative importance of random errors in frontal lobe pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used a WCST version sensitive to differences between 'efficient' and random errors to examine set shifting deficits in patients with focal lesions to their lateral prefrontal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As expected, patients showed abnormally high rates of perseverative errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, patients also showed enhanced rates of random errors suggesting constant shifts or fluctuations in their choice of sorting principle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that more sensitive tests are needed to elucidate the association between a specific type of set shifting error and a particular type of frontal lobe pathology </plain></SENT>
