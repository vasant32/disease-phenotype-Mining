<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into normothermic (37 degrees C) and mild hypothermic (32 - 33 degrees C) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The normothermic group was redivided into six subgroups of 8 rats: sham operation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> for 2 hours without reperfusion, and reperfusion for 6 hours, 16 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours respectively after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>; and the mild hypothermic group was redivided into 4 group with 8 rats: reperfusion for 6, 16, 24, and 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats except those in the sham operation subgroup were subjected to right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by insertion a specially prepared nylon filament for two hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ice bag was used to lower the brain temperature and anal temperature soon after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> to 32.0 - 33.0 degrees C within 10 minutes in the mild hypothermic subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The brain and anal temperature remained at 37.0 - 37.5 degrees C in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> normothermic subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Then the rats were killed 0, 6, 16, 24 and 48 hours after reperfusion respectively and their brains were taken out to examine the size of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The protein levels of IL-1beta and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 in the cortical ischemic core were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant change of IL-1beta protein level was found in the cortical ischemic cores at any time point after reperfusion among the normothermic subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The IL-1beta protein levels at different time points were not significantly different between the intraischemic mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> subgroups and the normothermic subgroups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 protein level in the cortical ischemic cores of the normothermic subgroups began to increase since the 6th hour afer reperfusion (22.5 +/- 8.7 ng x g tissue(-1), 17 times that in the sham operation samples, P &lt; 0.05), peaked in 48 hours (110.9 +/- 47.0 ng x g tissue(-1), 83.7 times that in the sham operation sample, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The protein level of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 in the mild hypothermic subgroups was 8.7 +/- 7.6 ng x g tissue(-1) 6 h after reperfusion (P &lt; 0.005 in comparison with those in sham operation subgroup and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> subgroup) and was 56.0 +/- 40.3 ng x g tissue(-1), 48 hours after reperfusion (P &lt; 0.05) incomparison with those in the normothermic subgroups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The sizes of cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> at different time points in the mild hypothermic subgroups were significantly smaller than those in the normothermic subgroups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> reduces the level of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 in the cortex after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion which may be one of the important mechanisms of the neuroprotective effects of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
