<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We determined plasmatic haemorrological factors (haematocrit, fibrinogen and total proteins) upon admission and again after one week and then at three months High fibrinogen levels in plasma were related to brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> mortality regardless of the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
