<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: By testing respectively on 21 subjects who were initially infarcted in basal ganglia with single focus on one side, and 21 healthy volunteers with corresponding age, gender and educational background with Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Scale (Rey), Clinical Memory Scale (CMS), Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale (HAD), National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS), Oxford Handicap Scale (OHS), Barthel Index (BI), and Aural Event Related Evoked Potential (AERP) as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the patient group got higher scores of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in HAD), which showed absolutely statistical significance; they demonstrated longer reaction time in AERP, which also showed statistical significance; and in CMS. they displayed inferior performance in the free picture recall and the memory quotient (MQ), which again had statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, compared with the control group, the patient group got scores with no significance in copy, immediate recall and delayed recall in Rey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The infarction in basal ganglia region with single focus on one side may impact on the patient's executive function, memory function and emotion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>But no impact is showed on patient's visual space function </plain></SENT>
