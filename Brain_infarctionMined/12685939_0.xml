<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The database consists of a total of 16 features collected from 44 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Features include age, gender, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> rate, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, medication and blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Metric and non-metric features are distinguished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First, the mean and covariance of the data are estimated and the correlated components are observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Second, major components are extracted by principal component analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, as common examples of local and global classification approach, a k-nearest neighbor and a high-degree polynomial classifier such as multilayer perceptron are employed for classification with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the components and major components case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Macrovascular changes emerged as the principal distinctive factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic-stroke</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Microvascular changes were generally ineffective discriminators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recommendations were made according to the rules of evidence-based medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Briefly, this case study, based on a small population, supports theories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> patients and also concludes that the use of intelligent data analysis improves personalized preventive intervention </plain></SENT>
