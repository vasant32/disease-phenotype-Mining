<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that subtoxic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> moderated the neuronal survival in vitro and vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed this experiment to clarify the precise mechanism underlie subtoxic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that pretreatment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> (100 mg/kg) increased the number of the surviving CA1 pyramidal cells of hippocampus at 5 days of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> could also enhance Akt activation after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion (I/R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we examined the possible mechanism that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> induced Akt activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the one hand, we found <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor-mediated Akt activation was associated with increased expression of BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) and activation of its high-affinity receptor TrkB after I/R in the hippocampus CA1 region, which could be held down by TrkB receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> K252a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, we found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> enhanced the binding of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-dependent calmodulin (CaM) to p85 (the regulation subunit of PI-3K), which led to the activation of Akt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>W-13, an active CaM inhibitor, prevented the combination of CaM and p85 and subsequent Akt activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor-mediated Akt activation was reversed by combined treatment with LY294002, the specific blockade of PI-3K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results suggested that subtoxic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> exerts the neuroprotective effect via activation of prosurvival PI-3K/Akt pathway against ischemic brain injury, and BDNF-TrkB signaling and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-dependent CaM cascade might contribute to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> induced activation of PI-3K/Akt pathway </plain></SENT>
