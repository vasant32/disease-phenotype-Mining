<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No study has examined its association with the lacunar subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present cross sectional study examined the relationship between MetS, its components and silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (SLI) in middle aged subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 2076 subjects aged 40-59 years with no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or clinical symptoms, who visited a health care facility for a routine health checkup and underwent brain MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MetS was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Programme Adult Treatment Panel III report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A multiple logistic regression model was used to examine the associations between MetS and SLI while adjusting for age, gender, a past history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e> and current smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MetS was strongly associated with the presence of SLI (adjusted OR 6.52; 95% CI 4.30 to 9.90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regarding MetS components, elevated blood pressure, impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, hypertriglyceridaemia and large waist circumference were significantly associated with SLI, independent of an interrelationship between the components, while low <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> was not significantly associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MetS was significantly associated with the prevalence of SLI in middle aged persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Independent risk factors for SLI not only included elevated blood pressure and impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, which are well known risk factors, but also hypertriglyceridaemia and large waist circumference </plain></SENT>
