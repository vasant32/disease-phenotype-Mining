<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Over the past 10 years, 10 cats with primary central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> by larvae of Cuterebra flies have been documented at Cornell University </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical abnormalities noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cats were progressive and most commonly consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (6/10), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> (6/10), and behavior changes (2/10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Affected cats presented most commonly in July (2/10) and August (7/10); one cat was presented in September </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diverse histopathologic changes are unique to this aberrant migration and consist of a combination of five characteristic features: 1) parasitic track lesion (7/10), 2) superficial laminar cerebrocortical <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> (10/10), 3) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (8/10), 4) subependymal rarefaction and <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> with or without ependymal cell loss (7/10), and 5) subpial <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> (7/10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes 2-5 occurred throughout the parenchyma unassociated with the track lesion or the parasite in the affected tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The larvae have been recovered most commonly in the region of the olfactory bulbs and peduncles, optic nerves, and cribriform plate, suggesting entry from the nasal cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Many of the changes noted are suggestive of a toxic factor elaborated by the parasite and borne within the cerebrospinal fluid, as well as vascular compromise as a component in those cats with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because of the prevalence of infarction associated with this syndrome and the lack of reported cases of such lesions in regions of the world devoid of the fly, we propose that aberrant cuterebral larval migration in the brain is the cause of feline ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
