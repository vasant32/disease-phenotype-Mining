<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Postmortem confirmation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was available in 10 dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> dogs were evaluated by CBC, serum biochemistry, thyroid and adrenal testing, urinalysis, thoracic and abdominal imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results of coagulation profile and arterial blood pressure were available in 32/33 and 28/33 dogs, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the imaging findings, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were classified depending on their type (territorial or lacunar) and location within the brain (telencephalic, 10/33; thalamic/midbrain, 8/33; cerebellar, 15/33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No marked associations among location or type of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and patient age and sex, occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo>, and the presence or absence of a concurrent medical condition were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Small breed dogs (&lt; or =15 kg) were significantly more likely to have territorial cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, whereas large breed dogs (&gt;15 kg) were significantly more likely to have lacunar thalamic or midbrain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A concurrent medical condition was detected in 18/33 dogs with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> (8/33) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001622" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperadrenocorticism</z:e> (6/ 33) being most commonly encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 33 dogs, 10 were euthanized because of the severity and lack of improvement of their neurologic status or the severity of their concurrent medical condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No association was identified between type or location of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and patient outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Dogs with concurrent medical conditions had significantly shorter survival times than those with no identifiable medical condition and were significantly more likely to suffer from recurrent neurologic signs because of subsequent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
