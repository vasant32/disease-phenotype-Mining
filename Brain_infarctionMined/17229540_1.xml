<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty 7-day-old rats underwent MRI 24h after HI brain injury was induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lesion size relative to whole brain was measured using T2WI and apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) maps, applying thresholds of 60%, 70% and 80% contralateral control hemisphere mean <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, and at day 10 post-HI on pathology with TTC staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression analysis was used to study the relationships between lesion size at MRI and pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lesion size measurement using <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> MRI methods significantly correlated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size at pathology; using T2WI, r=0.808 (p&lt;0.001), using 80% <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, 70% <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and 60% <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> thresholds, r=0.888 (p&lt;0.001), 0.761, (p&lt;0.001) and 0.569 (p=0.014), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighty percent <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> threshold was found to be the only significant independent predictor of final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (adjusted R(2)=0.775) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: At 24h post-HI, lesion size on DWI, using 80% <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> threshold is the best predictor of final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although T2WI performed less well, it has the advantage of superior spatial resolution and is technically less demanding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These are important considerations for experiments which utilize MRI as a surrogate method for lesion quantification in the neonatal rat HI model </plain></SENT>
