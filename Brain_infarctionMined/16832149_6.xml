<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical significance of measurement of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> subfractions in subjects with essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is yet to be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the association between the prevalence of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (SLI) and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> subfractions in patients with essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed brain MRI to detect SLI and measured <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> subfractions in 100 asymptomatic non-diabetic middle-aged subjects with essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (mean age, 62 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We fractionated <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> into three parts, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-1, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-2, and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-3, with <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-3 being the oxidized subfraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 100 study subjects, 24 (24%) had one or more SLIs, while the remaining 76 (76%) were considered as a non-SLI group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-3 levels were significantly higher in the SLI group than in the non-SLI group (8.3 +/- 4.4 mg/dl vs. 6.3 +/- 2.0 mg/dl, p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-3 levels alone were an independent predictor of SLI (odds ratio [OR]: 1.380; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.113-1.663; p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When subjects were divided into quartiles based on <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-3 levels, the prevalence of SLI was significantly higher in the highest <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-3 level group than in the lowest <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-3 level group (p = 0.0036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-3 levels are associated with the prevalence of SLI in subjects with essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
