<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To explore the frequency and patterns of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and other brain manifestations in cervicocephalic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissection</z:e> (CCAD) and to evaluate the correlation between vessel wall findings and infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The medical records and films of 136 consecutive CCAD patients diagnosed in Oulu University Hospital during the 20-year period since 1982 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five patients with no brain imaging were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One-hundred-and-twenty-seven patients underwent cerebral CT and four patients MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain infarction</z:e> was detected in 73 patients (56%), 43 of whom had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> associated with anterior circulation dissection and 30 cerebellar infarction associated with posterior circulation dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of the dissected vessel was accompanied by infarction in 76%, irregular stenosis in 40%, and other findings in 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the anterior circulation infarctions, territorial and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarctions</z:e> and territorial infarctions with fragmentation, which are considered embolic, accounted for 95%, while only 5% were in the watershed area and considered hemodynamic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intracranial posterior circulation dissection rarely caused infarction (in 1/11 of the dissected vessels), whereas intracranial anterior circulation dissection resulted in infarction more commonly (9/12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Altogether 23% of patients with intracranial CCAD had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic transformation was present in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: More than half of CCAD patients have cerebral or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> at CT or conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of the dissected vessel is accompanied by infarction more often than other vessel wall abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissections</z:hpo> are of embolic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Intracranial dissections cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in more than 20% of patients </plain></SENT>
