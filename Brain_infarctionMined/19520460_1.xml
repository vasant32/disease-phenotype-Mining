<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Automated brain segmentation was used to quantify volumes of brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, and WML on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total brain, ventricular, and cortical gray matter volume were divided by intracranial volume (ICV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological tests assessing executive functioning and memory performance were performed and composite scores were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed that smaller total brain volume, larger ventricular volume, and smaller cortical gray matter volume (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> as % of ICV) were associated with worse executive performance and that this association became stronger with presence of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> or severe WML volume (P-values for interaction &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No interaction between measures of brain volume and cerebrovascular pathology on memory performance was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that patients with cerebrovascular pathology on MRI may be more vulnerable to impairment in executive functioning related to global as well as focal brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
