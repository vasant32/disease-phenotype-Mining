<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to establish a thrombotic middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion model using cynomolgus monkeys, we measured the blood flow in the main <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> tract and cerebral cortex, brain damage, and neurological deficits, and compared them with those of mechanical <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic occlusion was induced photochemically by green light application on the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> treatment; mechanical occlusion was induced by <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> clipping for 3h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patency of the main <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> tract showed two patterns in the thrombotic model: permanent occlusion or cyclical flow reduction (CFR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) decreased during occlusion followed by post-ischemic hyperperfusion in the clipping model, whereas rCBF reduction expanded time-dependently in the thrombotic occlusion model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain infarction</z:e> and neurological scores in the thrombotic occlusion model were significantly larger than those in the clipping occlusion model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In histological assessment, microthrombi containing myeloperoxidase- and fibrinogen-positive cells were observed in the cortex following the thrombotic but not clipping occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results collectively suggest that this thrombotic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion model, because it shows impairment of cerebral microcirculation, could provide a vital platform for understanding progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> as well as for evaluating potential therapeutic drugs </plain></SENT>
