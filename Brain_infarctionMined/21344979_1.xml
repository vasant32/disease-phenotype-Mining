<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Intracisternal nicardipine prolonged release implants (NPRI) have been shown to be effective in the prophylaxis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (VS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, they cannot be used in patients following coil occlusion of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a certain dissemination of nicardipine within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been described, we examined the feasibility of intraventricular use of NPRI in patients that underwent clip and coil occlusion of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> following aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (aSAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By comparison with an historical control group, an estimation of their effectivity in regard to angiographic vasospasm and the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> has been performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-one patients suffering from aSAH were prospectively included in this trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Study participants received prior to clipping (n = 17) or coiling (n = 14) 6 (n = 15) or 10 NPRI (n = 16) into the lateral ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Physiological data were collected, proximal and global VS were determined using pre-operative and day 8 ± 1 angiography, and incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and VS related <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were evaluated and compared to a historical control group consisting of 16 operated patients without NPRI implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intraventricular NPRI were tolerated well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no adverse side effects detectable, physiological variables such as heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), intracranial pressure (ICP) and electrolytes showed no difference compared to control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the proportion of patients that required CSF shunting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A significant positive angiographic effect could only be observed in clipped patients (proximal vessel diameters: control, 80 ± 30%; NPRI 90 ± 24%; incidence of moderate/severe global VS: control, 73%; NPRI, 41%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of intraventricular NPRI seems to be safe and tolerated well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There is preliminary evidence for effectivity on angiographic VS for clipped patients only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A further increase of the effective dose might also exert efficacy in the subset of patients following coil occlusion </plain></SENT>
