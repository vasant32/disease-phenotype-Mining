<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The surveillance program consisted of clinical and ultrasonographic examinations at 1, 6 and 12 months and yearly thereafter </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Preoperative mean value of NIHSS score in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group was 4.7 (SD 3.2) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In surviving patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group NIHSS value improved in 13 cases, with a mean improvement of 2 points (SD 0.9); in 8 cases the value remained unchanged, while in the remaining case it increased from 2 to 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Mean postoperative NIHSS score in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group was 3.9 (SD 3.7), significantly reduced in comparison with preoperative value (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of follow-up was 34 months (SD 28.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>No ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> group occurred; in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group a recurrent fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at 1 postoperative month was recorded </plain></SENT>
