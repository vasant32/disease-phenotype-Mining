<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Growing lines of evidence suggests that high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) plays an important role for promoting <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, we demonstrated that inducers of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 (HO-1) significantly reduce HMGB1 release in inflammatory conditions in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we tested our hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18418">higenamine</z:chebi> protects brain injury by inhibition of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO)-mediated HMGB1 release in vivo, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidase (GOX)-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in C6 cells in vitro due to HO-1 induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="18418">Higenamine</z:chebi> increased HO-1 expression in C6 cells in both <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and normoxia, in which the former was much more significant than the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="18418">Higenamine</z:chebi> increased Nrf-2 luciferase activity, translocated Nrf-2 to nucleus, and increased phosphorylation of Akt in C6 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this, LY 294002, a PI3K inhibitor, inhibited HO-1 induction by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18418">higenamine</z:chebi> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>/GOX in C6 cells was prevented by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18418">higenamine</z:chebi>, which effect was reversed by LY 294002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18418">higenamine</z:chebi> (i.p) significantly reduced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, mortality rate, MPO activity and tissue expression of HMGB1 in MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, recombinant high mobility group box 1 induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in C6 cells by increasing ratio of Bax/bcl-2 and cleaved caspase c, which was inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18418">higenamine</z:chebi>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these effects were reversed by co-treatment with ZnPPIX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we conclude that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18418">higenamine</z:chebi>, at least in part, protects brain cells against hypoxic damages by up-regulation of HO-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18418">higenamine</z:chebi> may be beneficial for the use of ischemic injuries such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
