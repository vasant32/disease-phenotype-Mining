<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among these the Trial of ORG 10 172 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Treatment (TOAST) classification denotes five the etiological categories: large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, cardioembolism, small-<z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> of undetermined etiology and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> of other determined etiology, which are based on imaging and diagnostic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The object of research is the distribution of these TOAST categories in a demographically defined population and their impact on the need of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study involves patients recruited within the population-based Erlangen <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Project (ESPro) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were analysed at time points after admission as well as 3 and 12 month after the event. results were presented as adjusted Odds Ratios (aOR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>1355 patients with a first-ever-in-a-lifetime <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were registered in the Community of Erlangen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TOAST classification could be performed in 89 % (1206) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The etiological classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> resulted in 12 % large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, 26 % cardioembolism, 24 % small-<z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, 37 % <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> of undetermined etiology and 2 % <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> of other determined etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While 20 % of the patients were independent functionally at the Barthel index at admission, the number was 39 % after 12 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The category large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> showed the strongest relationship with the occurring need of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The aOR with very strong care needs 12.79 (95 % CI 3.71 -44.07) lay particularly high in comparison with an aOR of 6.95 (95 % CI 2.16 - 22.33) in the category cardioembolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The TOAST classification provides an appropriate tool for estimating the need of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In particular the patients in the TOAST category large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> showed a high level of a need of care at the long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
