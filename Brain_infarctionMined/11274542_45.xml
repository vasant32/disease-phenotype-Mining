<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the capability of computed tomography (CT) in the prediction of irreversible ischemic brain damage and its association with the clinical course within 6 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serial CT scans obtained within 6 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, at 22-96 hours (median, 1 day), and at 2-36 days (median, 7 days) after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in 786 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were prospectively studied, and follow-up CT scans were used as the reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical variables were assessed prospectively and independently of CT evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The specificity and positive predictive value of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> at baseline CT for brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were 85% (95% CI: 77%, 91%) and 96% (95% CI: 94%, 98%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and negative predictive values were 64% (95% CI: 60%, 67%) and 27% (95% CI: 23%, 32%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients without early CT findings were less severely affected (P&lt;.001), developed smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (P&lt;.001), had fewer <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> events (P&lt;.001), and had a better clinical outcome at 90 days (P&lt;.001) compared with patients with hypoattenuating brain tissue at early CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: After <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, x-ray hypoattenuation at CT is highly specific for irreversible ischemic brain damage if detection occurs within the first 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients without hypoattenuating brain tissue have a more favorable clinical course </plain></SENT>
