<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two Phase III studies comparing the safety and efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> as antiplatelet agents for the secondary prevention of vascular events in patients with prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were performed in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both studies were randomized, double-blind, double-dummy comparative trials with the primary objective of comparing the clinical safety of treatment with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> for up to 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The secondary objective was to assess the incidence of a combined efficacy endpoint of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were recruited during July 1996-February 1998 and September 2001-November 2003 at centers across Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of the two studies were combined in this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 1,869 patients in the safety population (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi>, 941; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi>, 928) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significantly, fewer patients experienced a safety event in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> group than in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> group (p &lt; 0.001; hazard ratio, 0.610; 95% confidence interval 0.529, 0.703) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Almost twice as many patients in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> group (25.6%) experienced hepatic dysfunction than in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> group (13.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 1,862 patients evaluable for efficacy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi>, 939; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi>, 923) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the incidence of the combined efficacy endpoint between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> (2.6% of patients) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> (2.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">Clopidogrel</z:chebi> was better tolerated than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the efficacy of the two agents with regard to the secondary prevention of vascular events in patients with prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This was the first combined analysis of direct comparison of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> in the clinical setting </plain></SENT>
