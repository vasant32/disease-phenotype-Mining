<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> blocked <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of immunostimulated astrocytes by preserving ATP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">Uridine</z:chebi> phosphorylase (UPase), an enzyme catalyzing the reversible phosphorylation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi>, was involved in this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we tried to expand our previous findings by investigating the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> effect on the brain and neurons using in vivo and in vitro ischemic injury models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Orally administrated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> (50-200 mg/kg) reduced middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (1.5 h)/reperfusion (22 h)-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in mouse brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, in the rat brain subjected to the same ischemic condition, UPase <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels were up-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Next, we employed <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in mixed cortical cultures of neurons and astrocytes as an in vitro model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cells were deprived of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and, two hours later, supplemented with 20 mM <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Under this condition, a significant ATP loss followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was observed in neurons but not in astrocytes, which were blocked by treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> in a concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of cellular uptake of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> by S-(4-nitrobenzyl)-6-thioinosine blocked the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similar to our in vivo data, UPase expression was up-regulated by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> as well as protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, 5-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48499">phenylthio</z:chebi>)acyclouridine, a specific inhibitor of UPase, prevented the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> effect was shown only in the presence of astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the present study provides the first evidence that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> protects neurons against ischemic insult-induced neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, possibly through the action of UPase </plain></SENT>
