<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to clarify the long-term prognosis by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes and to identify determinants for recurrence and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after a first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 1,732 consecutive patients (men/women = 1,134/598, mean age of 65 years) with a first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who were admitted to our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Care Unit during a period of 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> subtypes were classified as atherothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e>, cardioembolic infarction, other type of infarction, and brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prognosis was assessed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the hospital stay (mean 61 days), 99 patients died: 73 died directly from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 198 patients had recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, and 286 died within 3 years after the index <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall recurrence rate within the first year was 6.5%, which was different among <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with cardioembolic infarction (9.0%) as well as other type of infarction (9.1%) had more recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> within the initial year compared with the other subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (relative risk = 1.38), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (1.52), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> (1.40), and disability at discharge (2.64) were independent predictors for the recurrence and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 3 years after the first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The recurrence rate was different among <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes within 1 year after the index <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
