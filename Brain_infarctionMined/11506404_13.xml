<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is thought to result from occlusion of a deep perforating artery in the basal ganglia, centrum semiovale, or brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, occluded perforating arteries have only rarely been observed at postmortem in patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and have not been noted previously on imaging despite the increasing sophistication of the techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed nine patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> imaged with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in whom we observed a linear structure with density or signal features consistent with an occluded (or at least abnormal) perforating artery associated with the relevant lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The appearance might also have been caused by a leak of blood and fluid into the perivascular space around the artery, as in several patients the width of the tubular vessel-like structure (&gt;1 mm in diameter) was greater than the expected width of a perforating artery (&lt;0.8 mm in diameter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This interpretation is supported by the fact that the area of infarction was usually around the abnormal vessel, not at the end of it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We describe the patients' clinical and imaging features, and discuss alternative explanations for the imaging appearance and the implications for gaining insights into the cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
