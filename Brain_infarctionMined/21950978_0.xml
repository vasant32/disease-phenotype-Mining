<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the effect of midbrain lesions on eye movements is well investigated, little is known about its effect on head movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we measured eye and head (gaze) movements in five patients with unilateral, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> midbrain lesions and nine healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, vertical eye velocity was reduced as a result of the lesion compared to healthy subjects, whereas peak head velocity was not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, most patients displayed an increased contralesional <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> in peripheral head positions, independently of whether they presented a <z:mp ids='MP_0005191'>head tilt</z:mp> in the straight-ahead position or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that midbrain lesions affect the control of eye and head differently and independently </plain></SENT>
