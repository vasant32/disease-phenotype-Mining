<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The migratory efficiency of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) toward cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> after transplantation is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Valproate (VPA) and <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi> enhance in vitro migration of MSC by upregulating CXC chemokine receptor 4 and matrix metalloproteinase-9, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ability of VPA and <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi> to promote MSC homing and to improve functional recovery was assessed in a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MSC primed with VPA (2.5 mmol/L, 3 hours) and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48607">lithium chloride</z:chebi> (2.5 mmol/L, 24 hours) were transplanted into rats 24 hours after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological function was assessed via rotarod test, Neurological Severity Score, and body asymmetry test for 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was analyzed by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of homing MSC and microvessel density in the infarcted regions were measured 15 days after MCAO using immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Priming with VPA or <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi> increased the number of MSC homing to the cerebral infarcted regions, and copriming with VPA and <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi> further enhanced this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MCAO rats receiving VPA-primed and/or <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi>-primed MSC showed improved functional recovery, reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005601'>enhanced angiogenesis</z:mp> in the infarcted penumbra regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These beneficial effects of VPA or <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi> priming were reversed by AMD3100, a CXC chemokine receptor 4 antagonist, and GM6001, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50664">matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Priming with VPA and/or <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi> promoted the homing and migration ability of MSC, improved functional recovery, reduced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005601'>enhanced angiogenesis</z:mp> in a rat MCAO model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These effects were likely mediated by VPA-induced CXC chemokine receptor 4 overexpression and <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi>-induced matrix metalloproteinase-9 upregulation </plain></SENT>
