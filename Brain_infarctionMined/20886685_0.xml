<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> development depends on external factors and individual genetic specificity of patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Excessive NO production by inducible NO-synthase (iNOS) damages brain tissue at various stages of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The goal of this work was to study the role of 4 polymorphic variants of gene of inducible NO-synthase iNOS (-2447C/G, -1659C/T, -0,7(OTTA)n I/D, S608L (150C/T)) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant correlation between S608L (150C/T) polymorphism and infarction dynamics was observed during days 1-3 and 7-21 after infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These parameters correlated with neurological status estimated using the Orgogozo scale during days 1-7 of the disease development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was demonstrated that genotype N150N was associated with ischemic focus propagation regardless of its volume and neurological status by Orgogozo scale in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was also observed that genotype N150N had effect on ischemic damage during days 1-3 in case of low initial volume </plain></SENT>
