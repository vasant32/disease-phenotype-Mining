<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that temporal and spatial parameters of gait, including speed, stride length and double support time, are cross-sectionally associated with white matter hyperintensity, subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> or brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> on brain MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined 321 men and women (mean age = 78.3) participating to the Cardiovascular Health Study who were free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at the time of the gait assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analyses were set with gait as independent variable and brain MRIs as dependent variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gait measures were determined from the footfalls recorded on a 4-meter-long instrumented walking surface, the GaitMat II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain MRIs were examined for the presence of white matter hyperintensity (WMG, graded from 0 to 9), brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (predominantly subcortical) and ventricular enlargement (graded from 0 to 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Slower gait, shorter stride length and longer double support times were associated with greater prevalence of white matter grade &gt; or =3 (p = 0.02), and at least 1 brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (p = 0.04) independent of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate logistic regression models adjusted for demographics and clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e>, those with gait speed &lt;1.02 m/s were more likely to have WMG &gt; or =3 and at least 1 brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, compared with those with faster gait - odds ratio (OR): 2.85, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.35, 6.02, and OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.04, 4.19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Shorter stride length was also associated with greater probability of having at least 1 brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (gait stride &lt;0.88 vs. &gt;1.10 m: OR: 3.20, 95% CI: 1.49, 6.88), while longer double support times were associated with a greater probability of having WMG &gt; or =3 (double support time &gt;0.19 vs. &lt;0.14 s: OR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1, 4.7) independent of demographics and clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gait parameters were not significantly associated with ventricular grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, in this group of high-functioning older adults, poorer gait speed, shorter stride and longer double support time are associated with high white matter disease and subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
