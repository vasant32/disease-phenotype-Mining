<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few studies, however, have assessed the combined association of these changes on the severity of future <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the prospective population-based 3C-Dijon MRI study, 1701 non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> participants aged 65 to 80 years at entry had a brain MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Information on WML, hippocampal volumes, SBI presence, and brain parenchymal fraction were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 4-year follow-up, participants were screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> was defined as none, moderate, or severe calculated from neuropsychological test performance change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relation between brain MRI markers and longitudinal change in cognition was studied using polytomous logistic regression and multiple linear regression models controlling for potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two-by-two interactions were tested including with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, 46 participants showed severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e> and 224 participants showed moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analyses, risk of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e> as well as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> rate were significantly increased in participants with higher WML volume (p&lt; 0.01) and smaller hippocampal volume (p&lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results suggested that WML and hippocampal volumes had a cumulative effect on the future level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The APOE genotype was found to be an effect modifier of this association </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The co-occurrence of degenerative and non-degenerative pathologies could strongly affect the course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> expression </plain></SENT>
