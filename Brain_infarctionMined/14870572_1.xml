<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twelve risk factors including age, sex, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were analyzed using multiple logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A case of WML, which changed into infarction, was presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant (P &lt; 0.01) risk factors for WML were aging (odds ratio; 1.12/year) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (3.66), while those for SLI were aging (1.10/year), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (4.89), and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> (3.46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both WML and SLI emerged in middle age and thereafter the prevalence rates increased with age, although WML emerged earlier and was more frequent throughout than SLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that WML was essentially aging phenomenon, while SLI was strongly affected by vascular risk factors, although WML might possibly chang into infarction </plain></SENT>
