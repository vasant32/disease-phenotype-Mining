<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To evaluate the prevalence and to identify the risk factors of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (SBI) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 395 consecutive patients with first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> that underwent brain MRI were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalences of vascular risk factors in a SBI-positive (n=132) and in a SBI-negative group (n=263) were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalences and characteristics of SBI were further evaluated with respect to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype and periventricular white-matter hyperintensity (PWMH) lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of SBI among the 395 study subjects was 33.4%, and 10.1% of the study subjects had multiple-SBI lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common lesion site was basal ganglia (47%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR: 1.94, 95% CI: 1.22-3.07, P=0.005) and the presence of an advanced PWMH lesion (OR: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.06-2.96, P=0.030) were significantly associated with SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, an advanced PWMH lesion (OR: 2.88, 95% CI: 1.19-6.95, P=0.010) was more associated with multiple-SBI lesions than with a single-SBI lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of SBI was higher among those with the small-vessel disease type (45.5%) than in those with the large-artery disease (32.5%) or cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> type (25.6%) (P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of SBI in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was found to be high, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was found to be the most important risk factor of SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Small-vessel disease and a diffuse white-matter lesion were found to be closely associated with SBI, and especially with multiple-SBI lesions </plain></SENT>
