<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Perinatal <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is a major cause of mortality and long-term neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to compare the effects of two neuroprotective agents; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>, administered alone or in combination, on brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and TUNEL positivity in a neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After being anesthetized, 7-day-old pups (n = 80) underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> followed by exposure to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> for 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pups were then divided equally and randomly into 4 groups in order to receive the vehicle (saline, control group), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> or a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatments were administered intraperitoneally three times; the first being just before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the second after <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and the third 24 h after the second dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pups were sacrificed on postnatal day 10, their brains harvested and evaluated for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Percent infarcted brain volume was significantly reduced in pups receiving the drugs (either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> or their combination) compared with those receiving the vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, TUNEL staining showed markedly reduced numbers of TUNEL-positive cells per unit area in the CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus and in the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, no statistically significant differences were found regarding percent infarcted brain volume and number of TUNEL-positive cells among the drug-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">Magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>, two agents acting at different stages of HI brain damage, administered either alone or in combination, significantly reduced the percent infarcted brain volume and TUNEL positivity, suggesting that these agents may confer a possible benefit in the treatment of infants with HI <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
