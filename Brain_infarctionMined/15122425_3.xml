<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of these bone changes among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and precocious destructive lesions, and whether a relationship exists between these changes and epileptiform discharges lateralization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one patients had their ictal / interictal scalp EEG and skull thickness symmetry on MRI analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into three main groups according to the topographic distribution of the lesion on the MRI: hemispheric (H) (n=9); main arterial territory (AT) (n=25); arterial borderzone (Bdz) (n=17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The EEG background activity was abnormal in 26 patients and were more frequent among patients of group H (p= 0.044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thickening of the skull was more frequent among patients of group H (p= 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients (9.8%) showed discordant lateralization between epileptiform discharges and structural lesion (four of them with an abnormal background, and only two of them with skull changes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one of these patients, ictal SPECT provided strong evidence for scalp EEG false lateralization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that compensatory skull thickening in patients with precocious destructive brain insults are more frequent among patients with unilateral and large lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, EEG lateralization discordance among these patients seems to be more related to EEG background abnormalities and extent of cerebral damage than to skull changes </plain></SENT>
