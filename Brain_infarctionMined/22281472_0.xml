<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the initial symptom soon disappeared, transient attacks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> combined with <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> in the right arm occurred intermittently, particularly when she uprose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> image disclosed a small <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarcted focus at the genu of the left internal capsule, while MRA showed an occlusion of the intracranial portion of the left internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She was treated conservatively, but the transient attack continued and her consciousness was slightly lowered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since repeated examination revealed no recanalization of the occluded artery, treatment was reinforced by using <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> on day 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, her consciousness was not improved, and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> evoked <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On day 2, superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Soon after surgery, she regained alertness and the transient attack subsided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Examinations could not clarify the course of the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>She was treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> until she delivered a sound baby in the 37th week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is still debatable, it may be a good option even for a pregnant woman when suffering from intractable progressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
