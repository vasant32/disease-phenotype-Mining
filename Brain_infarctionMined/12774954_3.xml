<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) was introduced by applying a 75 gm. cm force to the right parietal cortex using the weight-drop method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first set of animals was used for determining time course changes of the synaptosomal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>/K+ and Mg(2+)/Ca(2+)-ATPase and the malondialdehyde levels and were sacrificed 2, 6 and 24h after lesion production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A group of the animals was treated with U-83836E proir to TBI and sacrificed 24h after cerebral injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A second set of animals was used for evaluating the alterations in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption and tissue water content and were sacrificed 2, 6 and 24h after lesion production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two groups of animals were treated with U-83836E and sacrificed after 2 and 24h following TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>U-83836E was given intraperitoneally thirty minutes before trauma at a dose of 10 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was also evaluated in the groups of U-83836E and physiological saline-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Extravasation of Evans blue into the traumatized hemisphere was maximum at 2h (p&lt;0.001) and returned close to the control levels at 24h after TBI (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>Edema</z:hpo> had developed progressively over time and reached the maximum degree of 2.1% (p&lt;0.001) at 24h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>U-83836E showed no effect on the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> breakdown and the tissue water content at 2h and still had no effect on the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> breakdown after 24h following the trauma (p&gt;0.05), although it reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> after 24h (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The losses of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>/K+ and Mg(2+)/Ca(2+)-ATPase activities were found as 39.5% (p&lt;0.001) and 29.4% (p&lt;0.01) of the control value, respectively, and remained at the decreased levels throughout the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Malondialdehyde level continued to increase over time reaching up to 209% (p&lt;0.001) of the control value 24h after TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Both ATPase activities were improved to near control values (p&gt;.05) by the effect of U-83836E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>U-83836E inhibited the increase of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation (p&lt;0.001) and also salvaged neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: U-83836E given prophylactically after cerebral trauma appears to reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, possibly by inhibiting increases in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and by stabilizing ATPase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Further studies are recommended to verify the similar effects of the brain penetrating lazaroids when they are given after trauma </plain></SENT>
