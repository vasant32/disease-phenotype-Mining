<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two were diagnosed as having ischaemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and 17 as having spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure was taken every four hours for twelve days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical situation was evaluated using the Rankin scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systolic and diastolic blood pressure progressively decreased without needing any medication in the first two weeks of evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The decrease was greatest in hypertense patients and in those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002625'>left ventricle hypertrophy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found the initial figures for systolic and diastolic blood pressure significantly higher in those patients with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> who had not died and in those in a better functional position the second week of evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure did not influence the prognosis of intracerebral haemorrhage patients </plain></SENT>
