<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The topical administration of SeV/GDNF induced high level expression of GDNF protein, which effectively reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume when administrated 0 and 1 hours as well after the reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the obvious nuclear translocation of AIF was found in neurons of peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, which significantly reduced with administration of SeV/GDNF 0 or 1 hour after reperfusion, as well as the number of TUNEL positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that SeV vector-mediated gene transfer of GDNF effectively reduced ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after tMCAO and extended the therapeutic time window compared with previous <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> vectors, and that promoting neuronal survival of GDNF might be related to the reduction of AIF nuclear translocation, indicating the high therapeutic potency of SeV/GDNF for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
