<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The concept of the neurovascular unit suggests that effects on brain vasculature must be considered if neuroprotection is to be achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX) is upregulated in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in mice, and 12/15-LOX contributes to brain damage after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The current study was designed to investigate 12/15-LOX involvement in vascular injury in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In cell culture, a human brain microvascular endothelial cell line was subjected to either <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35856">lipoxygenase inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For in vivo studies, mice were subjected to 90 minutes middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and the effects of either 12/15-LOX gene knockout or treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35856">lipoxygenase inhibitors</z:chebi> were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of 12/15-LOX and claudin-5 as well as extravasation of immunoglobulin G were detected by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>Edema</z:hpo> was measured as water content of brain hemispheres according to the wet-dry weight method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Brain endothelial cells were protected against <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35856">lipoxygenase inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2979">baicalein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, 12/15-LOX was increased in neurons and endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The vascular tight junction protein claudin-5 underwent extensive degradation in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, which was partially prevented by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35856">lipoxygenase inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2979">baicalein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Leakage of immunoglobulin G into the brain parenchyma was significantly reduced in 12/15-LOX knockout mice as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2979">baicalein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Likewise, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> was significantly ameliorated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 12/15-LOX may contribute to ischemic brain damage not just by causing neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, but also by detrimental effects on the brain microvasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>12/15-LOX inhibitors may thus be effective as both neuroprotectants and vasculoprotectants </plain></SENT>
