<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Coagulation and fibrinolytic parameters, as well as classical metabolic variables, were measured and compared with 52 age-matched, healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In MI women we observed elevated tissue type plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen levels, which correlated significantly with parameters of the plurimetabolic syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In LACI women we found elevated fibrinogen, which correlated with D-dimer, systolic blood pressure, smoking, and sedimentation rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prolonged euglobulin clot lysis time, elevated t-PA antigen, PAI-1 antigen and activity, which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> correlated with parameters of the plurimetabolic syndrome, were found in women with idiopathic VT, who were also clearly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> but not in women in whom oral contraceptives were the triggering factor for VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results showed not parallel, but different profiles of alterations in fibrinolytic and coagulation parameters in line with the prediction of a vascular bed specific <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> process </plain></SENT>
