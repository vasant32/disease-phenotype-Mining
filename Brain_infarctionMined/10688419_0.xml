<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In order to find out the difference between single brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> with transient signs and those with long-lasting signs, cerebral blood flow studies and blood tests were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten cases of single <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> with transient signs and 10 of single <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> with long-lasting signs were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subcortical cystic infarctions with a diameter of less than 1.5 cm were defined as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Episodes lasting less than 24 hours were classified as transient signs and those lasting 24 hours or more as long-lasting signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurements: cerebral blood flows were measured using the stable <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> computed tomography method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The regional cerebral blood flows were measured before and 20 minutes after the intravenous injection of 17 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma fibrinopeptide A, platelet factor 4 and beta-thromboglobulin concentrations were determined at the Special Reference Laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Blood flows in the cerebral cortex and cerebral white matter contralateral to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> were lower in the group with long-lasting signs than in that with transient signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> reactivity in the cerebral cortex and white matter contralateral to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> were lower in the group with long-lasting signs than in that with transient signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Plasma fibrinopeptide A, platelet factor 4 and beta-thromboglobulin concentrations were higher in the long-lasting signs group than in that with transient signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There may be some differences in pathogenesis between single <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> with transient signs and those with long-lasting signs </plain></SENT>
