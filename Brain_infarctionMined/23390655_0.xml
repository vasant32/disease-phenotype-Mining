<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Before admission to a hospital, the patients did not undergo neurorehabilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean period from the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> till the beginning of rehabilitation measures was 22.5 +/- 8.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rehabilitation was performed during 45 days using methods elaborated in the Center of Speech Pathology and Neurorehabilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The significant improvement of functional abilities assessed by the Barthel scale, which was more expressed in patients younger than 59 years, with smaller volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> lesions (r = -0.42; p = 0.02) and less extent of baseline functional deficit (r = -0.42; p = 0.02) was found after the restorative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The improvement of speech functions, which was more expressed in patients with the less severe degree of disorders at baseline; in acoustic/memory and afferent motor forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> and in patients with pyramidal insufficiency (p = 0.006) and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> (p = 0.005), was noted in 35 (43.75%) of patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest using a comprehensive approach to neurorehabilitation and confirm the efficacy of the method used for restorative treatment of patients in the residual period of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
