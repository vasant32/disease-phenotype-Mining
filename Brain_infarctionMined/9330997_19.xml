<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 47-participant subset examined in this study were college educated and lacked complicating conditions such as brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752347" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="DLB">diffuse Lewy body disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixteen participants had a clinical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The NIA-RI criteria imply a perfect correlation between neuritic plaque (NP) density and neurofibrillary tangle distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, NP density often did not coincide with tangle distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a result, it was not possible to categorize many of the participants using the NIA-RI guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 'high likelihood' category of the NIA-RI criteria for AD research settings (neocortical Braak stage and frequent neocortical NP) had relatively high specificity (90% of nondemented participants did not meet this criteria) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, only half of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> participants were in this category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neuropathologic criteria requiring the presence of neocortical tangles (rather than neocortical Braak stage) had relatively high sensitivity, accounting for 87-94% of participants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, but also included 32-35% of nondemented participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Criteria based on neocortical NP or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>senile plaques</z:hpo> had 100% sensitivity, but a majority of nondemented participants also met these criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results support consideration of both tangles and NP for the neuropathologic diagnosis of AD, but indicate that refinement of the NIA-RI criteria is necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A possible refinement is suggested for further consideration </plain></SENT>
