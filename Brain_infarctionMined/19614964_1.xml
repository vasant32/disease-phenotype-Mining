<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to describe the frequency and clinical impact of in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were identified from the Registry of the Canadian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Network (2003-2006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> severity was measured using the Canadian Neurological Scale (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional status at discharge was measured with the modified-Rankin Scale, and categorized into <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> with no or mild-moderate dependency (m-Rankin 0-3) and those with severe dependence or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (m-Rankin 4-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and clinical outcome (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or severe dependence at hospital discharge and 1 year mortality), independent of co-morbidities and in-hospital medical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 9180 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 72 years (SD 13.9) and 48% were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 211 (2.3%) patients were reported to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> during hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At hospital discharge, 64.9% of patients with in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> had died or were severely disabled, compared with 35.8% in the entire cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mortality at 1 year after ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 56.4% in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and 21.9% in the entire cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On multivariable analyses, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> was also associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or severe dependence at discharge (OR 2.51; 95%CI 1.75-3.59) and mortality within 1 year (HR 1.83; 95%CI 1.51-2.23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Previous history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (OR 1.50; 95%CI 1.05-2.15), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (OR 1.55; 95%CI 1.42-2.10), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity (OR 1.13; 95% CI 1.09-1.17) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> (OR 1.61; 95%CI 1.04-2.49) were independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> during hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial infarction</z:hpo> is an important medical complication after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
