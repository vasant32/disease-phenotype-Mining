<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to evaluate the levels of the proinflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) in serum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients, and to investigate the relation between these levels and demographic, laboratory, neuroimaging, and clinical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study comprised 23 first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients and 15 age- and sex-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood sampling for the determination of IL-12 and such peripheral markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and leukocyte count, together with cranial CT were performed within 24 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, while neurological and functional deficits were estimated, respectively, with the Scandinavian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (SSS) and Barthel Index (BI) within the same period and two weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> patients displayed significantly higher serum IL-12 levels in comparison with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The serum IL-12 levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients correlated significantly with the ESR values, the volume of early brain CT hypodense areas, and with the SSS and BI scores calculated within both studied times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results indirectly suggest that IL-12 may play a role in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
