<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the development of a modified method for <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi>-coating the tip of occluding threads which produces a malleable <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi>-coated tip which is firmly bonded and of highly consistent diameter, and overcomes problems of thread insertion through the narrowed carotid canal found in aged animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparison of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcomes and mortality were made between these threads and heat-treated poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi> coated threads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rate of successful <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induction in aged rats was significantly improved (from 14% to 86%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, mortality fell from 21-31% to 3-7% or less in both young and old rats with or without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An occluding thread tip diameter of 0.35-0.38 mm was optimal for induction of mid-sized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in both young and old rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This method of thread manufacture overcomes problems of inconsistency of diameter and bonding of the <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi>-coated tip, and these threads produce significant improvements in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induction by <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, particularly in aged animals and those with co-morbidities </plain></SENT>
