<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In many recovering hemiparetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, movement of the affected limb elicits ipsilateral activation of sensorimotor areas within the undamaged hemisphere, which is not observed in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, rats received intensive enriched-rehabilitation (ER) of the impaired forelimb for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Weekly assessments on a skilled reaching test demonstrated significant improvement in ischemic animals over 4 weeks of ER (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that if the undamaged forelimb motor cortex contributed to improved forelimb function, then inhibition of neural activity within this region should reinstate (at least some of) the initial motor impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 3 and 4 weeks of ER, animals received a microinjection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50512">lidocaine hydrochloride</z:chebi> into the undamaged motor cortex and were re-assessed on reaching ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The behavioral effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> challenge was dependent on the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>: animals with large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were rendered unable to retrieve any food pellets and had great difficulty even contacting a pellet with the affected forepaw </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Small-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> animals were only moderately affected (25% reduction in success) by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi>, an effect similar to that observed in control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Qualitative assessments of recovered reaching after 4 weeks of rehabilitation revealed that impairments in forelimb lift, advance and aim were exacerbated (P &lt; 0.05) following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi>-inactivation of the undamaged motor cortex of animals with large ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In animals with small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> challenge only impaired limb advance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, recruitment of the undamaged hemisphere may depend on the functional integrity of the remaining sensorimotor system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that, in the rat, the undamaged (ipsilateral) motor system may contribute to compensatory recovery of the affected forelimb </plain></SENT>
