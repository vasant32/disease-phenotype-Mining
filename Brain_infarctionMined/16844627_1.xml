<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Aprotinin is a serine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi>, which is usually used during cardiac surgery to reduce blood loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that aprotinin has neuroprotective effects during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We planned this study to evaluate its potential neuroprotective efficacy during hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty piglets with a median weight of 25.7 kg (interquartile range, 23.9-26.6) were randomly assigned to receive aprotinin or placebo prior to a 75-minute period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> at 18 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain microdialysis parameters and neurological and histological scores were the primary outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Changes in brain metabolic parameters and histopathological findings were favorable in the aprotinin group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> concentrations were significantly lower in the aprotinin group during the experiment (P = .02) along with blood <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> concentrations in the aprotinin group (P = .023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was significantly higher during the experiment (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure tended to be higher in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two of 10 animals in the aprotinin group and 4 of 10 in the control group failed to reach full recovery on the seventh postoperative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four animals of 10 in the aprotinin group and 6 animals of 10 in the control group had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (P = .40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present data suggest that aprotinin mitigates cerebral damage and improves neurological outcome following a period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
