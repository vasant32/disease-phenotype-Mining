<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the significance of vascular enhancement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with and without permanent neurologic deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively studied two groups of patients with spin-echo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging before and after injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31797">gadopentetate dimeglumine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the patients in group 1 (12 women, 22 men; age range, 32 to 76 years), who had permanent neurologic deficit caused by recent ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, we obtained 3 to 13 serial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images during follow-up examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group 2 consisted of 26 patients (14 women, 12 men; age range, 54 to 81 years) with transient neurologic deficit caused by angiographically proved high-grade stenosis or occlusion of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Vascular enhancement was present in 59% of patients in group 1 and in 65% of patients of group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In group 1, the frequency of vascular enhancement declined steadily over several weeks, but it was still present in single cases even after 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vascular enhancement correlated positively with the extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in group 1 and with the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Vascular enhancement as shown by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging may herald ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and could persist over several weeks in areas that show collateral flow after infarction has occurred </plain></SENT>
