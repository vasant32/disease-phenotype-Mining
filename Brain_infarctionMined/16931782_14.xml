<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Since the failure of a number of phase III trials of neuroprotection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, the need for smaller phase II studies with MRI surrogates has emerged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is, however, little information available about sample size requirements for such phase II trials and rarely enough patients in single studies to make robust estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have formed an international collaborative group to assemble larger datasets and from these have generated sample size tables for MRI-based <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> expansion as the outcome measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve centers from Australia, Europe, and North America contributed data from patients with hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> expansion was defined from initial diffusion-weighted images and later fluid-attenuated inversion recover or T2 images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sample size estimates were calculated from data on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> expansion ratios treated as dichotomous or continuous variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A nonparametric approach was used because the distribution of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> expansion was resistant to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> forms of transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As an example, a 20% absolute reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> expansion ratio (&lt; or = 1), 80% power, and alpha = 0.05 requires 99 patients in each arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To achieve an equivalent effect size with a continuous approach requires 61 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These tables will be useful in planning phase II trials of therapy with the use of MRI outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For positive studies, biologically plausible surrogates such as these may provide a rationale for proceeding to phase III trials </plain></SENT>
