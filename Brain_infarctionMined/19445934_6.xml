<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we modeled <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> by injecting 100 microL of autologous blood into the striatum of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We then tested whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> would reduce brain injury and improve recovery as has been repeatedly observed for ischemic and traumatic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aside from reducing blood-brain barrier disruption, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> has not consistently improved behavioral or histological outcome after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> in animal studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As this might relate to the choice of cooling method and the duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, we used a system that selectively cooled the injured hemisphere to approximately 32 degrees C (striatum) while the body remained normothermic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cooling (vs. normothermia) started 1 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> and lasted for 12 h, 3 days or 6 days followed by slow re-warming (approximately 1 degrees C/h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional impairment was evaluated from 2 to 3 weeks post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> at which time brain injury was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> caused significant impairment on a neurological deficit scale and in tests of walking (horizontal ladder), skilled reaching (tray task) and spontaneous limb usage (cylinder test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only the limb use asymmetry deficit was significantly mitigated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, and then only by the longest treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lesion volume, which averaged 16.9 mm3, was not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results, in conjunction with earlier studies, suggest that prolonged mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> will not be a profound neuroprotectant for patients with striatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>, but it may nonetheless improve functional recovery in addition to its use for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
