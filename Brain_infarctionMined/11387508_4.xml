<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Dissection of vertebral arteries</z:e> has been reported in association with minor neck movements without signs of trauma on the surface of the neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, injury of a vertebral artery can cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, few cases have been reported in which fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was due to nonocclusive, clinically undetected, traumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in a vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: A 62-year-old man was hit by a car, and a right <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> was found the day after the accident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cause of the infarction could not be detected by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the patient recovered favorably after surgical removal of the right lateral hemisphere of the cerebellum, he died suddenly 2 weeks after the accident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An autopsy and a microscopic study revealed pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and organizing traumatic lesions of the right vertebral artery without occlusion or noteworthy stenosis of the artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the patient sustained traumatic lesions of the right vertebral artery during the traffic accident 2 weeks before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and that his <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> was due to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> resulting from these traumatic lesions </plain></SENT>
