<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: As a basis for comparison of differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence in Scandinavian countries, a community-based <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> register was established in Orebro in the centre of Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> first-ever cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were registered during a 12-month period 1999-2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study population was 123,503 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The WHO definition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases were searched inside as well as outside hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple overlapping sources and 'hot pursuit' technique were used in the process of case ascertainment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 388 cases of first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were found, corresponding to a crude incidence rate of 314 (95% CI, 283-348) per 100,000 per year, 337 (95% CI, 294-386) for females, and 289 (95% CI, 248-336) for males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adjusted to the European population, the corresponding rates were 254 (95% CI, 227-284) per 100,000 per year, 273 (95% CI, 238-311) for females and 232 (95% CI, 206-261) for males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall 28-day case-fatality rate was 19% (95% CI, 15-23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The case-fatality rates for the different subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were as follows: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, 10%; intracerebral haemorrhage, 20%; subarachnoidal haemorrhage 45%, and undetermined pathological type 56% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study as well as other studies in northern and middle Scandinavia show significantly higher incidence rates than studies from other regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The crude incidence rate, reflecting the age distribution of the population, is even higher, indicating a burden to the community that is rather increasing than decreasing </plain></SENT>
