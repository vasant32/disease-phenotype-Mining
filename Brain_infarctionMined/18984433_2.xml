<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>VBD may be associated with an increased likelihood of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to establish predictors for clinical outcome in VBD, and better guide therapeutic medical and surgical interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 64 adult VBD cases diagnosed by magnetic resonance angiography were retrospectively identified and prospectively followed up (4-7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were age 18 years or older, VBD on magnetic resonance angiography, and consent to participate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with inadequate follow-up data or hemodynamically significant stenosis or occlusion of the posterior circulation were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed with predictor modeling in 45 VBD cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Basilar artery (BA) involvement was independently associated with the transient/fixed posterior circulation dysfunction (P = .03) with an adjusted odds ratio of 4.4 (95% confidence interval = 1.2-16.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A combination of African American ethnicity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo>, smoking, and BA involvement predicted 31% of posterior circulation dysfunction, resulting in an annual predicted likelihood of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of 4.4% to 7.8% in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo>, previous anterior and posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, BA involvement, and lack of previous <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> use predicted mortality in 23% of cases, resulting in an annual likelihood of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of 3.3% to 5.8% in patients with this combination of clinical and radiologic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with VBD, BA involvement increases the risk of neurologic morbidity, whereas mortality seems more predicted by classic vascular risk factors than VBD features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study may aid in predicting annual risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in VBD </plain></SENT>
