<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously modeled this in a gerbil global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model and found that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53221">PEM</z:chebi> impairs functional outcome and influences mechanisms of ischemic brain injury and recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since this model is no longer reliable, we investigated the utility of the rat 2-vessel occlusion (2-VO) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> model of global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> for further study of this clinical problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male, Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to either control diet (18% protein) or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53221">PEM</z:chebi> induced by feeding a low protein diet (2% protein) for 7d prior to either global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or sham surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="53221">PEM</z:chebi> did not significantly alter the hippocampal CA1 neuron <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (p = 0.195 by 2-factor ANOVA) or the increase in dendritic injury caused by exposure to global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, however, a strong trend was evident for <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53221">PEM</z:chebi> to decrease the consistency of hippocampal damage, as shown by an increased incidence of unilateral or no hippocampal damage (p=0.069 by chi-square analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53221">PEM</z:chebi> caused significant changes to baseline arterial blood pH, pO(2), pCO(2), and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (p&lt;0.05), none of these variables (nor hematocrit) correlated significantly with CA1 cell counts in the malnourished group exposed to 2-VO (p&gt;0.269) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intra-ischemic tympanic temperature and blood pressure were strictly and equally controlled between ischemic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that co-existing <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53221">PEM</z:chebi> confounded the consistency of hippocampal injury in the 2-VO model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanisms responsible were not identified, this model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> should not be used for studying this co-morbidity factor </plain></SENT>
