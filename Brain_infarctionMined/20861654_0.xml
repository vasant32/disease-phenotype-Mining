<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population consisted of 566 patients with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and 1,516 patients with nonlacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Secular trends for the periods 1986-1992, 1993-1998 and 1999-2004 were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age and the percentage of very old patients (≥85 years old) increased significantly (p &lt; 0.001) throughout the time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant decrease in the percentage of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, but the percentage of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The use of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also increased significantly </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Significant changes over a 19-year period included an increase in the patients' age, frequency of very old patients (≥85 years old) and use of MRI studies, whereas the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and length of hospital stay decreased </plain></SENT>
