<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have studied whether postischemic reactive glial cells express epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have also looked for signs of proliferating activity, as EGFR is known to be involved in cell growth and proliferation in certain non-neural cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EGFR was studied using three different antibodies which were found to stain for a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein (p170) corresponding to the membrane-anchored EGFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurons of the control brain were strongly immunoreactive to EGFR, but a decrease of EGFR-immunoreactivity was seen in the ipsilateral brain side from 24 h postischemia due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of abundant glial cells strongly immunoreactive to EGFR became apparent in this area from 4 days postischemia onward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The use of microglial (lectin or OX-42) and astroglial (GFAP) markers showed that these postischemic EGFR-stained cells were reactive microglia/macrophages and astroglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The subcellular localization of EGFR in reactive microglia/macrophages was compatible with the network of the Golgi apparatus, as revealed with an antibody against a peripheral membrane-bound protein of the Golgi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of abundant proliferating cells in the ischemic brain was detected from 4 days postischemia with an antibody against proliferating cell nuclear antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Proliferating reactive microglia/macrophages were abundant within the infarcted brain side, whereas proliferating astrocytes were found mainly in the immediate periphery of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> limiting the necrotic area from the undamaged tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These proliferating cells were immunoreactive to EGFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results show the presence of EGFR in postischemic reactive glial cells and suggest that EGFR-dependent pathways mediate signal transduction in reactive glia following transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
