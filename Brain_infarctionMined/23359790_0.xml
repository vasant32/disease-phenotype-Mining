<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study tried to develop an Asian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Disability Scale (ASDS) and compared its interrater reliability with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Barthel Index (BI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three items including self-care, mobility, and daily activities were selected as variables for development of the ASDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The variables were provisionally graded on a 2- to 4-point scale based on the importance of each item </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each of the variables was categorized into 3 categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Afterward, 125 rater-patient assessments for each scale (mRS, BI, and ASDS) were performed on 25 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients by 5 raters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For categorization of functional impairment as minor or major, the scores of mRS, BI and ASDS were categorized as ≤ 2 and &gt; 2, &lt; 90 and ≥ 90, and &lt; 3 and ≥ 3, respectively.125 rater-patient assessments for each of the mRS, BI, and ASDS were performed on 25 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients by five raters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The quantitative variability of BI, mRS, and ASDS scores was not significant (P = 0.379; P = 0.780; and P = 0.835, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interrater variability of mRS, BI, and ASDS scores based on qualitative categorization was not significant (P = 1.000; P = 0.978; and P = 0.901, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Paired interrater variability of mRS, BI, and ASDS scores based on qualitative categorization was not significant (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The ASDS is easy to use, requires less than 1 minute to complete and is as valid as mRS and BI in assessment of functional impairment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
