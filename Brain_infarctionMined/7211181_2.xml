<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The EEG was quantified according to normalized slope descriptor technique in nine patients and by means of a combined period and amplitude analysis in eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intravenously injected isotopes 133Xenon and 99TcmO4 were used for blood flow and circulation time measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The QEEG-values improved during the whole follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow stayed low for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 months and did not alter during this period, while initially prolonged circulation time to some extent improved within 2 weeks remaining, however, prolonged even thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A tendency for a positive correlation between QEEG and rCBF values in the infarcted hemisphere could be seen </plain></SENT>
