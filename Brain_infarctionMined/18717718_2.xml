<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The tuberothalamic artery (TTA), one of the arteries supplying the paramedian thalamic area, is peculiar because it originates from the posterior communicating artery (p-comA), which connects the vertebrobasilar and carotid systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Registry, 23 consecutive patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarction involving the TTA were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the mechanism of TTA infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen of 23 patients (61%) had coexisting infarctions outside the TTA territory (carotid in three, vertebrobasilar in seven, and both carotid and vertebrobasilar arteries in four patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coexisting lesions were most common in the posterior thalamoperforating arterial territory (seven patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven out of 14 patients (79%) with coexisting lesions had embolic sources from the heart or proximal atherosclerotic arteries, and cardioembolism was the most common mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, eight of the nine patients with isolated tuberothalamic lesions were classified as small vessel occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More patients with embolic sources had visible p-comA or fetal-type posterior cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The vertebrobasilar arterial system played a more dominant role in developing tuberothalamic infarction than the carotid arterial system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Isolated TTA infarctions are rare and mostly because of small vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with coexisting infarctions outside TTA territory usually have an embolic source, predominantly vertebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
