<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relation between IADE and other manifestations of small-vessel disease (multilacunar state, leukoaraiosis, and état criblé) was not investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The magnetic resonance images of 510 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in the Etude <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">du</z:e> Profil Genetique de l'Infarctus Cerebral (GENIC) study were evaluated for the diagnosis of multilacunar infarction (&gt;1 lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>), leukoaraiosis (assessed in periventricular and subcortical regions according to Scheltens and colleagues' scale, with severe leukoaraiosis defined as a score &gt; 8), état criblé (using a semiquantitative score ranging from 0-8, with severe EC &gt; 4), and IADE (using the consensus method) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By comparison with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients without IADE (n = 447), IADE(+) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (n = 63) had significantly more frequent multilacunar state (51 vs 33%), severe leukoaraiosis (34 vs 19%), and severe état criblé (32 vs 12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for potential confounding factors, the odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for the presence of IADE were 2.05 (1.08-3.87) for multilacunar state, 2.40 (1.11-5.20) for severe leukoaraiosis, and 3.60 (1.43-9.08) for severe état criblé </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The factors significantly associated with état criblé were older age and a familial history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IADE in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients was independently associated with parenchymal manifestations of small-vessel disease </plain></SENT>
