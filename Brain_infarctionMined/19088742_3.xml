<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The volume of fodrin breakdown zone, water content, and brain tissue levels of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>) were measured in the ischemic core and penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion attenuated fodrin breakdown, and the volume containing fodrin breakdown product at 3 h after reperfusion (5 h after MCAO) (30+/-7 mm(3)) was significantly smaller than the 42+/-3 mm(3) of the permanent occlusion group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 3 to 6 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> increased, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> decreased in the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion after 2 h of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion did not mitigate the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced changes in brain tissue electrolytes and water content at 3 to 6 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Even in reperfusion after comparatively long periods of occlusion where <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> size, assessed 3 days after MCAO, was not significantly reduced by reperfusion, and the precipitating indicators of the ischemic core (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>, water content) did not improve, temporary improvement or a delay in progression of ischemic injury was discernible in the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate the possibility that treatment with reperfusion is permissive to the effects of neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
