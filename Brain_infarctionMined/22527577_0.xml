<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysm</z:hpo> (AN) treatment appears to differ from country to country and even from centre to centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore we decided to conduct a survey in order to better understand the "state of the art" in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> treatment in Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary aim was to understand the roles of clipping and coiling in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An interactive form was sent to major European neurosurgical centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The responses relating to AN location, status (ruptured/unruptured) and treatment modality were divided with regard to the volume of cases and the centre's geographical location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Responses were received from 96 European centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The main finding was that clipping was used significantly more often in Eastern Europe than in the rest of Europe to treat ruptured ANs of the anterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ruptured ANs across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> locations are treated actively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The treatment of unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the anterior circulation is similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median relating to observed unruptured ANs across the Europe was 10 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Posterior circulation ANs are treated predominantly by coiling, regardless of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> status or geographical location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The average number of coilers versus surgeons per centre was 2.5:3.0 in Western, 1.9:3.6 in Southern, 1.9:4.3 in Eastern and 2.7:3.1 in Northern Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The way in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> are treated appears to correlate with the economic development of European countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is probably also affected by the lack of experienced coilers in Eastern Europe </plain></SENT>
