<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> is an unresolved riddle; this study tries to define its characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-four previously healthy patients who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> (&gt; or =39 degrees C) within 24 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lesion sites, nature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and clinical features were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0006051'>Brainstem hemorrhage</z:mp> was the most common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> (64%), followed by putamino-thalamus <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (24%), <z:mp ids='MP_0006052'>cerebellum hemorrhage</z:mp> (4%), large cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (4%), basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (3%), and <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> (1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whatever the site of the lesion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had brainstem involvement either by direct destruction or indirect compression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three fourths of the patients reached 39 degrees C within 12 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and 82% arrived at the maximum within 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A peculiar finding of central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> was the marked fluctuation in body temperature within a short period, which was more severe initially then decreased gradually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>Leukocytosis</z:hpo> was seen in 60%, but shift to the left was rare (1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prognosis was grave, nearly 70% of the patients expired within 1 month, especially those with a temperature of &gt;41 degrees C or those who reached 39 degrees C within 6 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or those who had severe fluctuations in temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> is characterized by rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, marked temperature fluctuation and high mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is likely associated with brainstem (mainly pons) damage by direct destruction or indirect compression </plain></SENT>
