<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between intracranial arterial dolichoectasia (IADE) and vascular risk factors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the carotid arteries as measured by ultrasound scan, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The sample consists of 510 consecutively recruited patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> confirmed by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of IADE was made by consensus between two neurologists based on MRI results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An independent reading of the 510 scans was made, with measurement of the diameter of the seven main intracranial arteries with a 16-diopter lens to validate the consensus and to better characterize patients with IADE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-three IADE(+) patients were identified by consensus (12%), of whom 59 (94%) had at least one intracranial artery in the fourth quartile of the distribution of diameters of intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses found an association between IADE(+) and age (OR [95% CI] 1.04 [1.01-1.08]), male sex (3.31 [1.67-6.55]), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (1.94 [1.01-3.72]), and previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (2.68 [1.33-5.38]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no association between IADE and carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> markers such as plaque or intima-media thickening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was more frequent in patients with IADE (36% versus 19%), with an adjusted OR of 2.89 (95% CI 1.29-6.46) compared with atherothrombotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IADE was associated with vascular risk factors such as age, male sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, previous history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, but not with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
