<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Distal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (dMCAo), which closely mimics human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, is one of the most used animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, although assessment of histological and functional outcome is increasingly recommended for preclinical studies, the latter is often excluded because of the high difficulties to estimate, especially in mice, behavioral impairments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to deeply screen functional consequences of distal permanent MCAo in mice to target relevant behaviors for future studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A set of sensorimotor and cognitive tests were performed during 3 weeks postsurgery in 2 groups of mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Afterward, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> were estimated by histological staining or magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, while no long-term functional impairments could be detected, the adhesive removal was the only test showing a deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, this sensorimotor impairment was correlated to cortical damage 3 weeks after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, despite the fact that dMCAo-induced deficits could not be evidenced by most of our behavioral tests, the authors showed that the adhesive removal test was the only one, sensitive enough, to highlight a long-term deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This result suggests therefore that this mouse model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is relevant to efficiently assess therapeutic strategies with histological but also behavioral analysis, provided that relevant tests are used </plain></SENT>
