<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This paper describes incidence rates and case-fatality for sub-types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> using data collected in Takashima, Shiga, Japan, from 1989 to 1993 and compares these with similar registers in other parts of Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Registered patients included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> residents of the county who experienced a first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> was defined as sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of neurological symptoms which continued for a minimum of 24 hours or led to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> such patients are hospitalized in this country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early case fatality was defined as patients who died within 28 days of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> type was based on clinical symptoms as well as computed tomography (CT) scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age-adjusted incidence rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> per 100,000 population aged 35 years and older were 268.7 for men and 167.5 for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The age-specific incidence rate of both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and cerebral haemorrhage increased with advancing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in men was twice as high as in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 28-day case fatality for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sub-types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 16.1% in men and 15.8% in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Case fatality for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, cerebral haemorrhage, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> was 10.7%, 22.4% and 28.6% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Takashima County has a moderately high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence rate and case fatality compared with other similar studies in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in men is twice that in women, while other sub-types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> showed smaller differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In order to decrease the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Japan, greater efforts at primary prevention will be necessary, in particular, it is important to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in men </plain></SENT>
