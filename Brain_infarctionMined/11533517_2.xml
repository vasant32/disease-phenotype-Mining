<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective study on 138 patients, with 138 carotid plaques, having, on presentation, a greater than 50 percent stenosis on duplex scanning and associated with an ipsilateral (to the plaque) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> (AF), hemispheric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e> (HTIA) or which were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This carotid artery defined the side of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a brain CT scan on presentation and subsequently were followed for a period of 1-5 years (mean 3.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The baseline CT neurovascular findings on the side of interest were classified as pattern A (discrete subcortical and cortical infarctions), pattern B (haemodynamic infarctions, widespread white matter lesions, basal ganglia infarctions and lacunae) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On follow-up, 5/27 (18.5 percent) of patients with pattern A, 4/38 (10.5 percent) with pattern B and 3/73 (4.1 percent) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CT appearance developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the hemisphere of interest (Cox regression: p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pattern A confers an unfavourable prognosis in patients with carotid atheroma who are either asymptomatic or presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> or hemispheric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> </plain></SENT>
