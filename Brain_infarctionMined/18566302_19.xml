<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DEFUSE is an open label multicenter study in which 74 consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were treated with intravenous tPA 3 to 6 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained before, 3 to 6 hours after, and 30 days after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lesion growth was defined as the difference between the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (30 day FLAIR) and the baseline diffusion lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline MRI profiles were used to categorize 44 patients into Mismatch versus Absence of Mismatch subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early recanalization was assessed in 28 patients with an initial vessel lesion on magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> growth was compared based on whether a favorable clinical response (FCR) occurred and whether early recanalization was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the Mismatch subgroup, FCR was associated with less <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth P=0.03 and early recanalization was predictive of both FCR (odds ratio: 22, P=0.047) and reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth P=0.024 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant relationship between recanalization, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth, and clinical outcome in the Absence of Mismatch subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A threshold of &lt;7 cc of growth had the highest sensitivity and specificity for predicting a FCR in Mismatch patients (odds ratio: 65, P=0.015, sensitivity 82%, specificity 75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to Absence of Mismatch patients, significant associations between recanalization, reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth, and favorable clinical response were documented in patients with a perfusion/diffusion mismatch who were treated with tPA within 3 to 6 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings support the Mismatch hypothesis but require validation in a larger study </plain></SENT>
