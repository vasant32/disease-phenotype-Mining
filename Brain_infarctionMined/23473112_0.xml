<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship of left atrial (LA) phasic volumes and LA reservoir function with subclinical cerebrovascular disease in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free community-based cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: An increase in LA size is associated with cardiovascular events including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is not known whether LA phasic volumes and reservoir function are associated with subclinical cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The LA minimum (LAV) and maximum (LAV) volumes, and LA reservoir function, measured as total emptying volume (LAEV) and total emptying fraction (LAEF), were assessed by real-time 3-dimensional echocardiography in 455 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free participants from the community-based CABL (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001626'>Cardiovascular Abnormalities</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain Lesions</z:e>) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subclinical cerebrovascular disease was assessed as silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (SBI) and white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV) by brain magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prevalence of SBI was 15.4%; mean WMHV was 0.66 ± 0.92% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Participants with SBI showed greater LAV (17.1 ± 9.3 ml/m vs. 12.5 ± 5.6 ml/m, p &lt; 0.01) and LAV (26.6 ± 8.8 ml/m vs. 23.3 ± 7.0 ml/m, p &lt; 0.01) compared to those without SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The LAEV (9.5 ± 3.4 ml/m vs. 10.8 ± 3.9 ml/m, p &lt; 0.01) and LAEF (38.7 ± 14.7% vs. 47.0 ± 11.9%, p &lt; 0.01) were also reduced in participants with SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In univariate analyses, greater LA volumes and smaller reservoir function were significantly associated with greater WMHV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, LAV remained significantly associated with SBI (adjusted odds ratio per SD increase: 1.37, 95% confidence interval: 1.04 to 1.80, p &lt; 0.05) and with WMHV (β = 0.12, p &lt; 0.01), whereas LAV was not independently associated with either </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Smaller LAEF was independently associated with SBI (adjusted odds ratio: 0.67, 95% confidence interval: 0.50 to 0.90, p &lt; 0.01) and WMHV (β = -0.09, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Greater LA volumes and reduced LA reservoir function are associated with subclinical cerebrovascular disease detected by brain magnetic resonance imaging in subjects without history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In particular, LAV and LAEF are more strongly associated with SBI and WMHV than the more commonly measured LAV, and their relationship with subclinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> is independent of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
