<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early postischemic APC application activates the cellular protein C pathway in brain endothelium and neurons, which is neuroprotective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whether late APC administration after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> is neuroprotective and whether APC influences brain repair is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we determined safety and efficacy of late APC and tissue-plasminogen activator (tPA) administrations in a mouse model of transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>tPA given at 6 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> killed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mice within 2 d, whereas APC given at 6 or 24 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> improved significantly functional outcome and reduced spread of the ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 7 d postischemia, APC multiple dosing (0.8 mg/kg, i.p.) at 6-72 or 72-144 h enhanced comparably cerebral perfusion in the ischemic border by approximately 40% as shown by in vivo lectin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> angiography, blocked blood-brain barrier leakage of serum proteins, and increased the number of endothelial replicating cells by 4.5- to 4.7-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>APC multidosing at 6-72 h or 72-144 h increased proliferation of neuronal progenitor cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) by 40-50% and migration of newly formed neuroblasts from the SVZ toward the ischemic border by approximately twofold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effects of APC on neovascularization and neurogenesis were mediated by protease-activated receptor 1 and were independent of the reduction by APC of infarction volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data show that delayed APC administration is neuroprotective and mediates brain repair (i.e., neovascularization and neurogenesis), suggesting a significant extension of the therapeutic window for APC intervention in postischemic brain </plain></SENT>
