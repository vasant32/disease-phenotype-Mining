<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Computer tomography of the cervical spine demonstrated a stenotic right vertebral artery at C4/5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, Doppler ultrasonography of the vertebral artery showed no abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiography confirmed complete occlusion of the left vertebral and a stenosis of the right vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dynamic angiography indicated occlusion of the stenotic region on the right side during reclination of the head </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgery using a posterior approach with decompression of the vertebral artery, lead to an excellent outcome and the patient left the hospital without any symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010819'>drop attacks</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ultrasonography, a stenosis of the vertebral artery caused by a spondylophytic compression could still be the cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At worst, the stenosis could lead to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> if left untreated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dynamic angiography is crucial for the diagnosis and surgical decompression has excellent results </plain></SENT>
