<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Infants are the most demanding patient group on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> and thus are vulnerable to neurological sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 21 patients &lt;2 years of age (mean 0.59 years) at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were evaluated by a neurologist, otologist, physiotherapist, and occupational therapist during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological tests were collected from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients at least 5 years old, and the brain images were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (52%) had a pre- or neonatal problem or comorbidity as risk factor for their development at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the end of the study, 71% had some <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurological abnormality</z:hpo>, 29% a major impairment (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with predialysis risk factors), and 43%â€‰ a minor one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were detected in four patients (19%) and other ischemic lesions in three (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients (14%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>hearing defect</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mortality rate was 5% </plain></SENT>
