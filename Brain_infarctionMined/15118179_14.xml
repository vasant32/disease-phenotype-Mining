<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Aortic arch <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> are often associated with embolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence and the characteristics of aortic arch <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among 487 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients who underwent transesophageal echocardiography, 283 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolism</z:e> diagnosed without significant occlusive lesions (&gt; or =50%) in their cerebral arteries were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured the intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) and evaluated the extension and mobility of the aortic arch <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up period of 3.4 years, we investigated the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence and the various characteristics of the aortic arch <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> &gt; or =4.0 mm was found in 67 patients (25.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 51 of these patients, the aortic lesions extended to the origin of the branches of the arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recurrences of cerebral ischemic events were found in 32 patients (recurrence group) and not in the other 251 (nonrecurrence group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aortic atheroma &gt; or =4.0 mm (41% versus 22%), aortic atheroma extending to the branches (63% versus 39%), and both (38% versus 16%) were more frequently seen in the recurrence group than in the nonrecurrence group (P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.1, P&lt;0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, an aortic atheroma that was &gt; or =4.0 mm as well as extending to the branches was found to be an independent predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> recurrence (hazard ratio=2.42, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> recurrence is associated with the severity of the atheroma (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> &gt; or =4.0 mm) and plaque extension to the branches </plain></SENT>
