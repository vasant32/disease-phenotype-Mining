<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the existence of a cross-talk between cathepsin B and proinflammatory caspases in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, as recently suggested by in vitro data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cortical ischemic damage was induced in mice by distal and permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasmic activation of cathepsin B was observed from the early stages of infarction, and displayed an activation pattern parallel to the activation pattern of caspase-1 and -11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry revealed the colocalization of cathepsin B with each caspase in cells of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The apical position of cathepsin B in both caspase-activation cascades was confirmed by pretreatment of the animals with the cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074, which also potently protected cortical structures from ischemic damage, indicating involvement of the proteases in the lesion process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results show that cathepsin B release is an early event following occlusion of cerebral arteries, which eventually triggers the activation of proinflammatory caspases in the absence of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This new pathway may play a critical role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> by promoting <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp>, and/or by amplifying the apoptotic process </plain></SENT>
