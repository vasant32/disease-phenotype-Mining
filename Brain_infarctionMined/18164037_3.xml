<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighed magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) is sensitive for the early diagnosis of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and identification of the territory involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical features, topographic appearance on DWI and etiology of thalamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reviewed clinical data, vascular risk factors, topographic patterns and etiology of thalamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into 2 groups according to DWI patterns: isolated thalamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (ISO-TH) and combined thalamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (COM-TH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The former were further subdivided into 2 subgroups: inferolateral isolated thalamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (INF-TH) and non-inferolateral isolated thalamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (NON-INF) according to the vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Patients were also divided according to etiology based on TOAST classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association of clinical features, DWI patterns and etiology was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty nine patients were included, among which, 23 (79.3%) were ISO-TH and 6 (20.7%) were COM-TH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common territory involved in the ISO-TH was inferolateral territory [n=17 (73.9%)], followed by tuberothalamic artery territory [n=3 (13.0%)], and posterior choroidal artery territory [n=2 (8.7%)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In COM-TH, the most common territory also was the inferolateral territory (n=3), followed by posterior choroidal artery territory (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients, the lesions involved more than one vascular thalamic territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Significant association between small-vessel occlusion (SVO) and ISO-TH (INF-TH+NON-IFN) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our study suggested that SVO was more prevalent in ISO-TH, and COM-TH needed more etiological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>DWI might provide meaningful clues about etiology of thalamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
