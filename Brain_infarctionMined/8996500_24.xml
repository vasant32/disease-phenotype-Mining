<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: [123I]Iomazenil is a specific radioligand for the central <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> receptor that may be useful as an indicator of the intactness of cortical neurons after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the binding of this receptor in reperfused cortex among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> to detect viable neurons in cortex that appeared structurally intact on conventional neuroimaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen patients were selected by (1) angiography within 24 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> showing embolic occlusion of an intracranial artery, (2) cerebral blood flow showing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of moderate severity in 12 cases and spontaneous reflow in 2 cases, and (3) thrombolysis with reperfusion within 24 hours in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty reperfused cortical areas that remained structurally intact, 7 infarcted cortical areas, and 6 contralateral cerebellar areas with reduced blood flow were selected as regions of interest to estimate receptor binding 5 days to 23 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A two-compartment model was used to compute the distribution volume (Vd) of iomazenil in relative units, with Vd proportional to <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> receptor concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The side-to-side asymmetry ratio of Vd was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean asymmetry ratio was 0.89 +/- 0.11 (range, 0.64 to 1.05), 0.50 +/- 0.15 (range, 0.23 to 0.67), and 0.97 +/- 0.05 (range, 0.90 to 1.04) in reperfused cortex, infarcted cortex, and contralateral cerebellum, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with unity, both reperfused cortex and infarcted cortex showed significant decrease of Vd (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Contralateral cerebellum showing diaschisis had no reduction of Vd </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On MRI, obtained 3 or 6 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> was observed in two reperfused areas where the asymmetry ratio was moderately reduced (0.64 and 0.80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The reduction of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> receptor concentration in reperfused cortex that remained structurally intact is likely to be the result of injury involving only a limited number of neurons (ie, incomplete infarction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the degree of viability of ischemic cortex apparently salvaged by early reperfusion can be quantified by iomazenil </plain></SENT>
