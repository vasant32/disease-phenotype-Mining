<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study was untaken to investigate the association of micro brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (MBIs) with antemortem global cognitive function (CF), and whether brain weight (BW) and Alzheimer lesions (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo> [NFTs] or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>neuritic plaques</z:hpo> [NPs]) mediate the association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects were 436 well-characterized male decedents from the Honolulu Asia Aging Autopsy Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain pathology was ascertained with standardized methods, CF was measured by the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument, and data were analyzed using formal mediation analyses, adjusted for age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, time between last CF measure and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, education, and head size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on antemortem diagnoses, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> and nondemented subjects were examined together and separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In those with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, MBIs were strongly associated with the last antemortem CF score; this was significantly mediated by BW, and not NFTs or NPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, among those with an antemortem diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, NFTs had the strongest associations with BW and with CF, and MBIs were modestly associated with CF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: This suggests that microinfarct pathology is a significant and independent factor contributing to brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, particularly before <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is clinically evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The role of vascular damage as initiator, stimulator, or additive contributor to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> may differ depending on when in the trajectory toward <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> the lesions develop </plain></SENT>
