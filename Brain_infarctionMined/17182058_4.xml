<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (SBI), which is cerebral target organ damage of hypertensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathies</z:e>, is frequently seen in hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to investigate the relation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001095'>hypertensive retinopathy</z:hpo> (HTR) and SBI in subjects without a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five hundred-fifty hypertensive subjects without history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> had brain MRI and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> photographs taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of SBI was assessed from the MRI scans, which was defined as a lesion of at least 3 mm in diameter with typical imaging characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence HTR was defined from digitized <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> photographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-seven subjects (14%) showed HTR (grade 1 in 46, grade 2 in 31 persons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis showed that age (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.10) and HTR (OR, 2.01 for grade 1; OR, 3.03 for grade 2) were the independent indicators for the presence of SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The higher the grade of HTR, the more prevalent SBI than persons with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> retina (by linear by linear association test, p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HTR is associated with the presence of SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> photography may be useful for identifying hypertensive subjects at increased risk of having SBI regardless of current blood pressure status </plain></SENT>
