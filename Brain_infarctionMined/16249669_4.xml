<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The authors propose that for a moderate reduction of perfusion during progressive irreversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, oxygen extraction increases to maintain aerobic metabolism, and arteriojugular oxygen difference (AJDo2) increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of reduced carbon dioxide washout, venoarterial difference in carbon dioxide tension (DPco2) increases, with no change in the DPco2/AJDo2 ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With further reduction of cerebral perfusion, the aerobic metabolism will begin to decrease, AJDo2 will decrease while DPco2 will continue to increase, and the ratio will increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> develops, the metabolism will be abated, no oxygen will be consumed, and no carbon dioxide will be produced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors studied 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral damage that evolved to brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and collected intermittent arterial and jugular blood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four patterns were observed: (1) AJDo2 of 4.1 +/- 0.7 vol%, DPco2 of 6.5 +/- 1.9 mmHg, and a ratio of 1.55 +/- 0.3 with cerebral perfusion pressure of 62.5 +/- 13.4 mmHg; (2) a coupled increase of AJDo2 (5.8 +/- 0.7 vol%) and DPco2 (10.1 +/- 1.0 mmHg) with no change in ratio (1.92 +/- 0.14) and cerebral perfusion pressure (57.9 +/- 5.8 mmHg); (3) AJDo2 of 4.7 +/- 0.4 vol% with an increase in DPco2 (11.8 +/- 1 mmHg) and correspondingly higher ratio (2.7 +/- 0.2); in this phase, cerebral perfusion pressure was 39.7 +/- 10.5 mmHg; (4) immediately before diagnosis of brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (cerebral perfusion pressure, 17 +/- 10.4 mmHg), there was a decrease of AJDo2 (1.1 +/- 0.1 vol%) and of DPco2 (5.3 +/- 0.6 mmHg) with a further ratio increase (5.1 +/- 0.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Until compensatory mechanisms are effective, AJDo2 and DPco2 remain coupled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, when the brain's ability to compensate for reduced oxygen delivery is exceeded, the ratio of DPco2 to AJDo2 starts to increase </plain></SENT>
