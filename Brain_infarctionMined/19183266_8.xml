<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Very few in vivo IP models have been established for neonatal brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined whether rapid, intermediate, and delayed IP against hypoxic-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (HI) could be induced in neonatal brain, and if so, whether the IP involved phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB) after HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postnatal day 7 rat pups were subjected to HI at 2 h (2-h IP), 6 h (6-h IP), or 22 h (22-h IP) after IP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three IP groups had significantly reduced neuronal damage and TUNEL-(+) cells 24 h post-HI than no-IP group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with control, the no-IP group had significant decreases of pCREB and mitochondria Bcl-2 levels in the ipsilateral cortex 24 h post-HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the three IP groups had increased pCREB and mitochondria Bcl-2 levels, and significant differences were found between three IP and no-IP groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increases of cleavage of caspase-3 and poly (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase and of cells with nuclear <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> inducing factor post-HI in no-IP group were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly reduced in three IP groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increases of caspase-3 and calpain-mediated proteolysis of a-spectrin post-HI were significantly reduced only in 22-h IP group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three IP groups had long-term neuroprotection at behavioral and pathological levels compared with no-IP group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, IP, rapid, intermediate, or delayed, in neonatal rat brain activates CREB, up-regulates Bcl-2, induces extensive brakes on caspase-dependent and -independent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> after HI, and provides long-term neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
