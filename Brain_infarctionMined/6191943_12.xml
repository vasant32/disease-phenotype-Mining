<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The EEG was recorded within 48 h from the first symptoms and thereafter weekly for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The EEGs were analyzed both visually and with a computerized spectral analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight of the patients recovered fully and seven had permanent neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On admission, 87% of the patients had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>abnormal EEG</z:hpo> by visual analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The spectral parameters correlated well with visual findings, especially the delta and alpha bands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The spectral analysis was superior to visual in predicting the correct laterality of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It showed the correct side of the lesion in 87%, while the visual did it in only 54% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The first EEG records reliably predicted the outcome of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The degree of background abnormality was most important in visual EEG analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In spectral analysis, parameters from single derivations were superior to the average of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> derivations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A high proportion of delta or low proportion of alpha power were reliable indicators of poor outcome </plain></SENT>
