<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored the presence of classic risk factors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> in young women with LACI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Charts of 192 consecutive premenopausal women suffering cerebrovascular insult [125 (65%) haemorhagic, 58 (30%) ischaemic and 9 (5%) unclassified] during a period of 5 years were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixteen out of 58 (27%) patients with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were identified to have LACI and included in a study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten and seven out of 16 LACI women had at least one classical risk factor (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e>, smoking or oral contraceptives) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LACI patients had slight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> indicated by shorter thrombin and thromboplastin times, higher fibrinogen and higher t-PA antigen than 47 age matched controls (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition in LACI patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> the trend toward more pronounced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> in comparison to LACI patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, at least one classic risk factor and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> was present in 5/16 (31.25%) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combination of slightly to moderately expressed classic risk factors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> might be a risk profile for LACI in young women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to clarify risk profile, rather than isolated risk factors, for LACI in a specific group as young women are </plain></SENT>
