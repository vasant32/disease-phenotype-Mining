<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The goal was to investigate if coated-platelet production differs between patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and non-lacunar (cortical) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Blood samples from 60 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (20 lacunar and 40 cortical) and 70 controls were analyzed for coated-platelet production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Coated-platelet production was significantly lower in patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (21.8 +/- 11.4%, mean +/- 1 SD) as compared with either controls (31.6 +/- 13.2%, P = 0.008) or patients with cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (39.4 +/- 12.7%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increase in coated-platelets for patients with cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as compared with controls was also significant (P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a marked difference in coated-platelet synthesis in lacunar vs. non-lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, thereby providing additional support for the existence of distinct pathological processes underlying these two subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further investigation of the role of coated-platelets in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, taking into account these preliminary findings, is warranted </plain></SENT>
