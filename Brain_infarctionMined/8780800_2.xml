<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery was occluded (MCAO) in 19 spontaneously hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine rats were sham operated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve to 16 days after the ischemic insult, 9 of the MCAO rats received transplants of dissociated fetal neocortical tissue (MCAO-T) and 1, 3 and 6 months after transplantation surgery, the rats were behaviorally evaluated by a test for forelimb function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> and transplant sizes were measured morphometrically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining volume of the infarcted hemisphere was 66 +/- 7% (mean +/- SD) in the MCAO group and 71 +/- 9% in the MCAO-T group of the non-operated hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> grafted rats had surviving transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Contralateral to the lesion, paw-reaching was highly impaired in both infarcted groups compared with sham-operated controls with no significant difference between MCAO and MCAO-T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lesion size correlated significantly with contralateral paw-reach performance at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> test periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that neocortical grafts did not alleviate the impaired forepaw function </plain></SENT>
