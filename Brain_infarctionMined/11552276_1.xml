<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty four isolated CABG patients who underwent on cardiopulmonary bypass and whose intraoperative body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gains</z:mp> were accurately measured were studied retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean intraoperative body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> was 2.61 +/- 0.9 kg/m2 in the study group and 1.06 +/- 0.6 kg/m2 in controls, i.e.) 100 patients selected at random from CABG patients during the same period using cardiopulmonary bypass without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> renal faulure, showing a statistically significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complete revascularization was successful in 98% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postoperative nonlethal complications involved <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in 1 patient (1.7%), reintubation in 1 (1.7%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002590'>paralytic ileus</z:hpo> in 2 (3.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were successfully extubated within 24 hours of surgery, and no sternal wound complications were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hospital mortality was 6.3% (4/64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival rates at 3, 5 and 8 years including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were 90%, 70% and 56%, and estimated by cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were 95%, 90%, and 90% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cardiac event free rates were 90%, 73% and 61% at 3, 5 and 8 years after CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In CABG for dialysis patients, the use of cardiopulmonary bypass demonstrates significant merits, and may expect long-term survival with minimal postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
