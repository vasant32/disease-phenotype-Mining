<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The animals were treated intraperitoneally with PA at 2.5, 5 or 10 mg/kg, for both 30 min before <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and 6 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was occluded for 1 h in anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with vehicle-treated controls, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occluded animals treated with PA showed dose-dependent reductions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> size with improved neurological and motor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biomedical assay showed that the PA treatment suppressed <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and restored <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) activity in brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion (I/R) induced elevation of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) production and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS) activity in brain tissue was also inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, PA demonstrated a neuroprotective effect in the I/R model and the beneficial effects of the compound may result from the reduction of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and the inhibition of NO production induced by I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effects of PA have highlighted the potential use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26775">stilbene</z:chebi> oligomers in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
