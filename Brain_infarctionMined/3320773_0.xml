<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical, vascular and brain-morphological findings were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 106 occluded ICAs, 59% had induced a completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with visible hemispheric infarction in 77%, most of them of the territorial type (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>32% of 85 high-grade stenoses had led to completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, with territorial, low-flow and microangiopathic patterns of infarction occurring equally frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CT was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in two-thirds of 83 low-grade ICA-stenoses, whereas 14% showed microangiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that (1) asymptomatic ICA stenoses should not be operated on, as long as they are not of very high degree and (2) even symptomatic ICA stenoses should not undergo endarterectomy, if the patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> of typical site and size </plain></SENT>
