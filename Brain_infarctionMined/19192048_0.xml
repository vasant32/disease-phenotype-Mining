<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that primary neuropathic dysfunction might be involved in the pathogenesis of BMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CGRP) plays an important role in the development of pain and serves as a biological marker of trigeminovascular activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the levels of CGRP in the saliva of BMS patients and estimate the trigeminovascular activation in BMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CGRP levels were measured, by RIA method in 78 BMS patients and 16 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The levels of CGRP were non-significantly decreased in BMS patients in comparison to healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that trigeminal nerve degeneration may be the underlying cause of BMS </plain></SENT>
