<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Small silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (SBI) is often found on magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) images of apparently healthy individuals at cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Particularly, small SBI found in subcortical white matter, basal ganglia, or thalamus is thought to be caused by cerebral small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although several lines of evidence suggest a role of inflammatory processes in atherothrombotic vascular events, their involvement in SBI remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study examines the associations between serum inflammatory markers and SBI as a manifestation of cerebral small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred ninety-four patients without histories of cardiovascular accidents were prospectively enrolled for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and carotid ultrasonography, and patients with SBI diagnosed underwent further <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As common inflammatory markers, serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SBIs were found in 40 patients, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of those were located in subcortical and infratentorial area, without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiographic evidence for obstructive lesions in proximal cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean hsCRP and IL-6 levels were higher in patients with SBI than in those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, higher levels of both hsCRP (odds ratio [OR], 1.85 per standard deviation [SD] increase) and IL-6 (OR, 2.00/SD increase) were associated with higher likelihood for SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the associations were only slightly attenuated when adjusting traditional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of hsCRP and IL-6 appear to be associated with small SBI, suggesting a role of inflammatory processes in cerebral small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
