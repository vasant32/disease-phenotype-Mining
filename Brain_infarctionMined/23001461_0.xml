<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of Qushuanling Capsule ( QSLC) on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation and platelet aggregation in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Arteriovenous bypass, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, and middle cerebral artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> models were used in rats to investigate the anti-thrombotic effects of QSLC, a compound of nine Chinese herbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The platelet aggregation induced by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>), thrombin or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> (AA), as well as the contents of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> B(2) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26996">TXB</z:chebi>(2)) and 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">prostaglandin F1</z:chebi>α (6-keto-PGF1α) in rat plasma and aortic walls, were determined to investigate the possible mechanisms of the anti-thrombotic effects of QSLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After oral administration with QSLC for 7 days, arteriovenous bypass <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was obviously suppressed compared with the model group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was also obviously suppressed, rat behaviors were obviously improved, and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size as well as water content were also reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The platelet aggregation induced by <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> or thrombin was inhibited by QSLC, but the drug had no effect on AA-induced platelet aggregation and content of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26996">TXB</z:chebi>(2) and 6-keto-PGF1α in plasma and the aortic wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that QSLC can be used in the prevention and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic diseases</z:e>, and that its mechanism of action may be related to inhibition of platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
