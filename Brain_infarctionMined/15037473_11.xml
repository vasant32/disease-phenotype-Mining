<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001272'>Cerebellar atrophy</z:hpo> may occur as a result of a primary injury, such as infarction or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Impaired growth of a non-injured cerebellum may be seen as a secondary effect related to damage in other remote but connected areas of the brain, or so-called diaschisis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury leads to poor cerebellar growth and whether such impairment occurs asymmetrically in infants with predominantly unilateral brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used a computerized quantification program to measure cerebellar size by using serial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Term-born infants presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> presumed due to a hypoxic-ischemic insult within 48 hours of delivery were included if they had two or more volume acquisition images obtained at least 3 months apart but within the first 15 months of delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When data were grouped by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> appearances, significant differences in total cerebellum growth were seen between infants with focal infarction and those with basal ganglia and thalamic injury (P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unilateral forebrain lesions shown on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging were not predictive of asymmetric cerebellar growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Infants with focal infarction of the cerebral hemisphere had an apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pattern of growth in both cerebellar hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in infants with severe basal ganglia and thalamic lesions, cerebellar growth was reduced, and the vermis showed little or no growth during the first year after birth </plain></SENT>
