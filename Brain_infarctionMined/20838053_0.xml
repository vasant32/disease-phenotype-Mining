<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: Stiff arteries cause high pulse pressure and flow to be transmitted to distal organs during systole, damaging the cerebral microvasculatures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association between the severity of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), the pulsatility of cerebral arteries, and the stiffness of large arteries in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (LI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects included 120 patients with LIs, who underwent MRI, transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, and brachial ankle pulse wave velocity (BaPWV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the severity of CSVD, the pulsatile index (PI) of both middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi>), and BaPWV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with higher BaPWV were more likely to have multiple LIs and more severe white matter lesions, and tended to have higher age, systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, heart rate, and the PI of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The PI of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> significantly correlated with BaPWV (with PI: r = 0.441, p &lt; 0.001) and age (with PI: r = 0.538, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that aging (β = 0.008, p &lt; 0.001) and BaPWV (β = 0.001, p = 0.007) were independent determinants of the PI of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> after adjustment for sex, pulse pressure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that systemic arterial stiffness may be associated with the severity of CSVD and pulsatility of cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
