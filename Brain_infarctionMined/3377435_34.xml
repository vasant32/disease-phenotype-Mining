<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventy-three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> patients underwent neurological examinations and high-field, heavily T2-weighted axial cranial magnetic resonance image (MRI) scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighteen of the 73 had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, defined as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, focal neurological sign lasting longer than 1 hour; in the event of a <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsive</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, an MRI abnormality as a correlate was necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of the 18 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients demonstrated focal MRI abnormalities consistent with arterial borderzone infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five of the 73 patients had no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six of the 55 (11%) had focal MRI abnormalities suggesting previous subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five of these lesions were in borderzone regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The distinguishing feature in 21 of the 22 patients with MRI abnormalities was the predilection for lesions in the high cortical convexity, in the general regions of arterial borderzones between the major cerebral arteries and adjacent deep white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pattern of MRI lesions suggests two pathogenetic mechanisms: (1) proximal large-vessel disease with inadequate cerebral perfusion (distal field insufficiency syndrome) and (2) distal small-vessel disease (sludging syndrome) </plain></SENT>
