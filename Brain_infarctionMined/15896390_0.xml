<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our results show that following left hemispherectomy (LH), children evidence a greater error rate in the use of functional category elements than their right hemispherectomy (RH) counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, error rates are surprisingly low and comparable across groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We interpret these results as (a) weak empirical evidence for a left hemisphere advantage in acquisition of functional structure, (b) strong support that functional structure is a property of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> human grammars, and (c) strong support that each isolated developing hemisphere has the potential to acquire a grammar embodying and constrained by highly specific structural principles defining human language </plain></SENT>
