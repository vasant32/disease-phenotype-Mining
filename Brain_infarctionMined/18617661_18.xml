<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated contralesional corticospinal tract remodeling in the brain and spinal cord in rats after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and treatment of bone marrow stromal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to permanent right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phosphate-buffered saline or bone marrow stromal cells were injected into a tail vein 1 day postischemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An adhesive removal test was performed weekly to monitor functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Threshold currents of intracortical microstimulation on the left motor cortex for evoking bilateral forelimb movements were measured 6 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When intracortical microstimulation was completed, biotinylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> was injected into the left motor cortex to anterogradely label the corticospinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 4 days before euthanization, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033839" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudorabies</z:e> virus-152-EGFP and 614-mRFP were injected into left or right forelimb extensor muscles, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were euthanized 8 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats (n=5), the corticospinal tract showed a unilateral innervation pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> rats (n=8), our data demonstrated that: 1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> reduced the stimulation threshold evoking ipsilateral forelimb movement; 2) EGFP-positive pyramidal neurons were increased in the left intact cortex, which were labeled from the left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-impaired forelimb; and 3) biotinylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi>-labeled contralesional axons sprouted into the denervated spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow stromal cells significantly enhanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 responses (n=8, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated that corticospinal tract fibers originating from the contralesional motor cortex sprout into the denervated spinal cord after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and bone marrow stromal cells treatment, which may contribute to functional recovery </plain></SENT>
