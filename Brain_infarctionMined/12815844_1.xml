<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to evaluate the participation of small (diameter between 26 microns and 90 microns) and terminal (diameter between 10 microns and 25 microns) arterioles in the status lacunaris of the basal ganglia and to classify tortuous vascular profiles based on morphometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Paraffin sections, 40 microns thick, of the basal ganglia from autopsied patients over the age of 45, were stained with <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A three-dimensional microscope, R400 (edge) was used to evaluate the structure of the blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six patterns of the tortuous profiles were identified: simple kink, loop, knot, tangle, coil, and wave, and well as their combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tortuous arterioles in the basal ganglia were present both in control group and status lacunaris cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, statistical Student's t-test analysis revealed a significant increment in the number of microfields containing tortuous terminal arterioles in the status lacunaris group (mean 7.50 +/- 4.62) versus the control group (mean 2.92 +/- 1.38) (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A risk for status lacunaris was associated with the increased frequency of tortuous terminal arterioles (Odd ratio = 1.94, 95%-Confidence Interval = 1.17-3.22) (p = 0.008) but not small arterioles (Odd ratio = 1.64, 95%-Confidence Interval = 0.62-4.38) (p = 0.39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest than an increased number of tortuous terminal arterioles is associated with status lacunaris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six characteristic patterns of the tortuous profiles as well as their combinations were identified </plain></SENT>
