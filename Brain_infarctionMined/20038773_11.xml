<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 2002 and 2008, we performed NOTCH3 gene analysis (exons 2-23) in 81 probands because CADASIL was clinically suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective analysis and comparison of clinical, familial, and neuroimaging features of patients with and without pathogenic mutations was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CADASIL was diagnosed in 16/81 (20%) probands by finding a mutation leading to a cysteine substitution within the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats of the NOTCH3 receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 65 patients, no pathogenic mutation was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some features were significantly (Fisher exact test p &lt; 0.05) more frequent in CADASIL than in NOTCH3-negative patients: history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> (73 vs 39%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> before the age of 60 among relatives (71 vs 32%), severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> (94 vs 62%), white matter changes extended to the anterior temporal lobes (93 vs 45%), external capsule involvement (100 vs 50%), and presence of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (100 vs 65%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of vascular risk factors was balanced between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No feature was peculiar to either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although certain clinical and neuroimaging features are more frequent in cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> with subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> (CADASIL) than in NOTCH3-negative patients, none is pathognomonic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinicians should be aware that when diagnosing CADASIL, a number of patients with a cerebral disease phenotypically similar to CADASIL emerge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The genetic profile of these diseases and the full phenotypic difference with CADASIL remain to be further defined </plain></SENT>
