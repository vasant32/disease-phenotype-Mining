<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Alberta <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Program Early Computerized Tomography Score (ASPECTS) was used to detect significant early ischemic changes on brain CT of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We designed the modified ASPECTS and compared it to the above system based on the inter-rater reliability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional validation study was conducted based on the inter-rater reliability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CT images were chosen from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> data bank of Ghaem hospital, Mashhad in 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inclusion criteria were the presence of middle cerebral artery territory infarction and performance of CT within 6 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Axial CT scans were performed on a third-generation CT scanner (Siemens, ARTX, Germany) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Section thickness above posterior fossa was 10 mm (130 kV, 150 mAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Films were made at window level of 35 HU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The brain CTs were scored by four independent radiologists based on the ASPECTS and modified ASPECTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The readers were blind to clinical information except symptom side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cochrane Q and Kappa tests served for statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 24 CT scans were available and of sufficient quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Difference in distribution of dichotomized ≤7 and &gt;7 ASPECT scores between four raters was significant (Q=13.071, df=3, p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Distribution of dichotomized &lt;6 and ≥6 scores based on modified ASPECT system between 4 raters was not significantly different (Q=6.349, df=3, p=0.096) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Modified ASPECT method is more reliable than ASPECTS in detecting major early ischemic changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients candidated to tPA thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
