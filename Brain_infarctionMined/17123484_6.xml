<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study characterized morphological changes in the cortex and hippocampus of Sprague-Dawley rats following photothrombotic infarction and epileptogenesis with emphasis on the distribution of neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Animals were lesioned in the left sensorimotor cortex and compared with age-matched naive and sham-operated controls by immunohistochemical techniques at 1, 3, 7, and 180 days post-lesioning (DPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NPY immunostaining was assessed by light microscopy and quantified by the optical fractionator technique using unbiased stereological methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 1, 3, and 7 DPL, the number of NPY-positive somata in the lesioned cortex was increased significantly compared to controls and the contralateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 180 DPL, lesioned <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> animals with frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> activity demonstrated significant increases of NPY expression in the cortex, CA1, CA3, hilar interneurons, and granule cells of the dentate gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to NPY immunostaining, <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp>, cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/cell loss, and astroglial response were assessed with cell-specific markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nissl and NeuN staining showed reproducible infarctions at each investigated time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FJB-positive somata were most abundant in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core at 1 DPL, decreased markedly at 3 DPL, and virtually absent by 7 DPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Activated astroglia were detected in the cortex and hippocampus following lesioning and the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, NPY protein expression and morphological changes following cortical photothrombosis were time-, region-, and pathologic state-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Alterations in NPY expression may reflect reactive or compensatory responses of the rat brain to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarction and to the development and expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
