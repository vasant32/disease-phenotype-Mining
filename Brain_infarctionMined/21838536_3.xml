<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the precise origin, identity, and subtypes of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced NSPCs (iNSPCs), which can contribute to cortical neurogenesis, is currently still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our present study, using an adult mouse cortical infarction model, we found that the leptomeninges (pia mater), which is widely distributed within and closely associated with blood vessels as microvascular pericytes/perivascular cells throughout central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>), have NSPC activity in response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and can generate neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate that microvascular pericytes residing near blood vessels that are distributed from the leptomeninges to the cortex are potential sources of iNSPCs for neurogenesis following cortical infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, our results propose a novel concept that the leptomeninges, which cover the entire brain, have an important role in <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> restoration following brain injury such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
