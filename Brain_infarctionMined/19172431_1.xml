<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Much work indicates that parietal cortex mediates the transformation of visual information into the motor commands necessary for successful performance of many unimanual tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence suggests that parietal cortex also mediates the coordination of bimanual movements, during which the natural tendency is to couple the limbs temporally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the extent to which parietal oculomotor and/or visual processes contribute to temporal coupling of the limbs during bimanual task performance is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we monitored the eye movements of a patient with a left parietal infarction as she performed a series of bimanual visuomotor tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate the impact of an ipsilesional (leftward) orientation bias on her ability to synchronize the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of bimanual limb movements; the movements were performed in serial fashion, i.e., left limb before right, when the patient was permitted to freely shift saccades and the visual target cuing the left (ipsilesional) limb movement was presented at greater (leftward) eccentricities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disruption of interlimb synchrony as such was not, however, evident when the patient was required to fixate or when visual targets were presented at lesser ipsilesional eccentricities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, despite the disruptive influence of oculomotor and visual factors on interlimb synchrony, the patient appeared capable of using visual feedback to straighten the right (contralesional) limb trajectory, thus improving the spatial component of task performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that parietal cortex plays an important role in the coordination of limb movements during performance of bimanual visuomotor tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This role appears to involve orienting gaze or attention to the goals of each limb so that the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system can synchronize the activity of both limbs and thereby ensure successful task completion </plain></SENT>
