<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STIM1 has been identified as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident Ca(2+) sensor that regulates store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) in immune cells and platelets, but the identity of the platelet SOC channel has remained elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Orai1 (CRACM1) is the recently discovered SOC (CRAC) channel in T cells and mast cells but its role in mammalian <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we report that Orai1 is strongly expressed in human and mouse platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To test its role in blood clotting, we generated Orai1-deficient mice and found that their platelets display severely defective SOCE, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>-induced Ca(2+) responses, and impaired activation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation under flow in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a direct consequence, Orai1 deficiency in mice results in resistance to pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, and ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, but only mild <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time prolongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results establish Orai1 as the long-sought platelet SOC channel and a crucial mediator of ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events </plain></SENT>
