<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were assessed using transcranial Doppler, carotid ultrasound and pre- and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical status, need for shunt insertion and significant decrease in the blood flow in the middle cerebral artery were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> data were analysed using multivariate regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of the 76 patients examined, 17 (22%) had new postoperative lesions seen on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of them (4%) were symptomatic, 14 (18%) were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The multivariate regression models showed that ME is a potent predictor of "silent" ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e>, at p&lt;0.001 (OR [95% CI]-1.1 [1.05, 1.2]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Digital plaque texture analysis predicted ME (p=0.028; OR [95% CI]-0.32 [0.12, 0.89]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk of ME increases steadily with the decrease in the echogenicity of the plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ME is a potent predictor of "silent" ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An analysis of plaque texture can predict the degree of ME during endarterectomy and is more precise than the standard GSM </plain></SENT>
