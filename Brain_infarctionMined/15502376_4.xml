<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The subjects were 637 middle-aged (40-64 years) and 222 elderly (65-79 years) men who participated in a health checkup program from 1999 to 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The association between lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> identified by magnetic resonance imaging and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, including abdominal visceral fat accumulation evaluated by computed tomography, was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was 4.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was associated with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> among both the middle-aged men [age-adjusted odds ratio (OR)=2.9 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-7.8)] and the elderly men [OR=5.1 (95%CI: 1.4-19.0)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abdominal visceral fat accumulation was slightly associated with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> among middle-aged men, but not among elderly men: OR in the highest (&gt;or=117 cm(2)) vs lowest (&lt;or=83 cm(2)) tertiles of fat area was 2.6 (95%CI: 0.9-7.6) for middle-aged men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Extreme accumulation of visceral fat (&gt;or=143 cm(2)) was still slightly associated with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> after adjustment for age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, drinking and smoking among middle-aged men [OR=2.7 (95%CI: 0.8-9.1)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This cross-sectional study suggests that abdominal visceral fat accumulation is a possible risk factor of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, in addition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, in middle-aged Japanese men </plain></SENT>
