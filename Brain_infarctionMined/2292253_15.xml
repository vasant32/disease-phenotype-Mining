<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our series of 269 patients with native valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> studied between 1970 and 1982, 35 were anticoagulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We observed 14 patients with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, of whom five died, and 12 patients with cerebromeningeal or brain haemorrhage of whom six died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a similar series of 63 patients with prosthetic valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom were on anticoagulation and were studied between 1972 and 1987, we observed five patients with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, three of whom died, and two patients with brain haemorrhage, one of whom died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>) was similar for both groups (11.1% in prosthetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> vs 11.5% in native valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, P = ns), as was mortality rate (57% vs 48.4%, P = ns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> are significantly more frequent among anticoagulated patients (19/94 vs 19/238: P less than 0.01), but the mortality rate in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> is similar for anticoagulated and non-anticoagulated patients (11/19 vs 8/19: P = ns) </plain></SENT>
