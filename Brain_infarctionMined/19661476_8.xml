<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We recently found that increases in plasma levels of protein-conjugated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> oxidases, enzymes that produce <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi>, are good markers for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether the level of protein-conjugated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> is increased and levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15746">spermine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16610">spermidine</z:chebi>, the substrates of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> production, are decreased at the locus of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A unilateral infarction was induced in mouse brain by photoinduction after injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">Rose Bengal</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The volume of the infarction was analyzed using the public domain National Institutes of Health image program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The level of protein-conjugated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> at the locus of infarction and in plasma was measured by Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamines</z:chebi> at the locus of infarction and in plasma were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The level of protein-conjugated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> was greatly increased, and levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15746">spermine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16610">spermidine</z:chebi> were decreased at the locus of infarction at 24 hours after the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The size of infarction was significantly decreased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">N-acetylcysteine</z:chebi>, a scavenger of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was also found that the increases in the protein-conjugated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamines</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> oxidases in plasma were observed after the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the induction of infarction is well correlated with the increase in protein-conjugated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> at the locus of infarction and in plasma </plain></SENT>
