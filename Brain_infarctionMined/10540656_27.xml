<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging for monitoring tissue viability in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging protocol used to measure apparent diffusion coefficient and perfusion parameters was extended to include <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tissue <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> concentration was estimated by using a two-compartment model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This protocol lasted less than 45 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These parameters were followed over the first 6 hours in a nonhuman primate model (n = 2) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> without or with thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This protocol was used in patients in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (&lt; 24 hours, n = 11) or nonacute (&gt; or = 24 hours, n = 31) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was ultimately confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The animal model showed abnormal diffusion and perfusion parameters in the lesion immediately after embolization, and these remained abnormal for over 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tissue <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> concentration increased with time (5.7 mmol/L/h) unless halted with thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regions with <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> concentrations over 70 mmol/L were histochemically verified as being infarcted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> older than 6 hours was clinically confirmed, <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> concentrations over 70 mmol/L were found in the appropriate brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Tissue <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> concentration provides a sensitive measure of tissue viability that is complementary to the diagnostic role of diffusion and perfusion imaging for ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
