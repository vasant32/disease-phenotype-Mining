<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One complication in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005283" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">beta-thalassaemia</z:e> who had prolonged survival is <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e>, which results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> involving major organs including the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined the prevalence of microthrombosis in the brain in an asymptomatic subgroup of patients with b-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271979" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassaemia intermedia</z:e> (TI) who had undergone splenectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This retrospective review included 200 patients with TI diagnosed on the basis of blood count, <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) electrophoresis and clinical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their ages ranged from 18 to 34 years, 19 (63.3%) were women and 11 (36.7%) were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We selected 30 patients at random who fulfilled the inclusion criteria: Hb concentration &gt;7 g/dl), splenectomy and platelet count &gt;500,000/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their mean Hb concentration was 8.4 g/dl and their mean ferritin concentration was 519 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was done in every patient, and the findings were interpreted by an expert neuroradiologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Imaging studies showed pathological findings in 28% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six had changes in the white matter suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and two had evidence of small infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: 1) In this small subset of patients diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging to monitor early asymptomatic or subclinical vascular damage in the brain can be considered when they reach the age of 20 years, and repeated every 3-5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>2) Treatment with antiplatelet aggregants is suggested in patients with documented asymptomatic brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>3) These results require confirmation in a larger group of similar patients with other types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassaemia</z:e> who are multitransfused or have an intact spleen </plain></SENT>
