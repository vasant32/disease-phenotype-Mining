<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent research has focused on the relationship between spared or seemingly "healthy" neural tissue and motor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we examined MRI scans of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to determine if characteristics of seemingly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> parenchyma could predict either response to different forms of upper extremity physical rehabilitation or to pre-treatment motor status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (ages 60.6 Â± 11.9 years) and mild/moderate upper extremity <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> were administered either CI therapy (n = 14) or a comparison therapy (n = 29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were assessed prior to and following therapy with MRI scans and the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) Performance Time measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total voxels in combined grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) segments (parenchymal volume) were divided by total voxels in GM, WM, and cerebrospinal fluid segments (intracranial volume) to obtain the brain parenchymal fraction (BPF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BPF correlated with treatment gains on the WMFT (r(43) = -0.31, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations between pre-treatment motor function and BPF were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with greater BPFs after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> show larger arm function gains after CI therapy, suggesting that reductions in volume of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing tissue may relate to ability to benefit from rehabilitation therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
