<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> and OSA (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo>) syndrome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (IS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 92 male IS patients were classified by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001956'>hypopnea</z:mp> index (AHI) into 2 groups: non-OSA group (AHI &lt; 5/h) and OSA group (AHI &gt; or = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were tested for plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> when polysomnography was finished at (14 +/- 2) d after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of IS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> was significantly higher in the OSA group than that in the non-OSA group (17 +/- 5 vs 11 +/- 3 micromol/L, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pearson correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level and the severity of AHI (r = 0.482, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further multiple linear regression analysis showed that AHI and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> were independent predictors of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level (R2 = 0.553, P &lt; 0.01, beta for AHI = 0.671, beta for <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> = -0.256) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The severity of OSA is significantly associated with an elevated level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> in IS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>And this association is independent of other causative factors of an elevated level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
