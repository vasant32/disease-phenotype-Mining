<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested whether simple geometric models generated accurate estimates of these volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> diffusion-weighted image (DWI) and perfusion (mean transit time [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>]) in 63 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and established <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes in 50 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were measured by computerized planimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mismatch was defined as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>/DWI &gt; or = 1.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Observers, blinded to planimetric values, measured lesions in three perpendicular axes A, B, and C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Geometric estimates of sphere, ellipsoid, bicone, and cylinder were compared to planimetric volume by least-squares linear regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ABC/2 formula (ellipsoid) was superior to other geometries for estimating volume of DWI (slope 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94 to 1.38; R(2) = 0.91, p = 0.001) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> (slope 1.11, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.23; R(2) = 0.89, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The intrarater and interrater reliability for ABC/2 was high for both DWI (0.992 and 0.965) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> (0.881 and 0.712) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, the ABC/2 formula also best estimated planimetric volume (slope 1.00, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.19; R(2) = 0.74, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In general, sphere and cylinder geometries overestimated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> volumes and bicone underestimated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value for mismatch was 92% and negative predictive value was 33% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Of the models tested, ABC/2 is reproducible, is accurate, and provides the best simple geometric estimate of infarction and mean transit time volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ABC/2 has a high positive predictive value for identifying mismatch greater than 20% and might be a useful tool for rapid determination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
