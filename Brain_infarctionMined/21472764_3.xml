<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced changes in GLP-1R immunoreactivity in the gerbil hippocampal CA1 region were evaluated after transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>; in addition, the neuroprotective effect of the GLP-1R <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> exendin-4 (EX-4) against ischemic damage was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GLP-1R immunoreactivity and its protein levels in the ischemic CA1 region were highest at 1 day after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion (I/R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 4 days after I/R, GLP-1R immunoreactivity was hardly detected in CA1 pyramidal neurons, and its protein level was lowest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GLP-1R protein level was increased again at 10 days after I/R, and GLP-1R immunoreactivity was found in astrocytes and GABAergic interneurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, EX-4 treatment attenuated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo>, neuronal damage, and microglial activation in the ischemic CA1 region in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EX-4 treatment also induced the elevation of GLP-1R immunoreactivity and protein levels in the ischemic CA1 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that GLP-1R is altered in the ischemic region after an ischemic insult and that EX-4 protects against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> possibly by increasing GLP-1R expression and attenuating microglial activation against transient cerebral ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
