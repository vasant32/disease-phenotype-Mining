<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The signals obtained with the pulse sequences used so far are both T1 and T2 weighted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate the extent to which changes in metabolite signals during the course of infarction can be explained by changes in T1 and T2 relaxation times, eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STEAM sequences with varying echo delay times and repetition times were used to measure T1 and T2 of N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> plus phosphocreatine (Cr+PCr) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> containing compounds (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>) in a 27-ml voxel located in the affected area of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten healthy volunteers served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found no difference in T1 or T2 of the metabolites between the patients and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The T2 of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> was longer than that of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> and Cr+PCr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that spectra obtained in brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue with the same acquisition parameters are directly comparable with respect to relative signal intensities as well as signals scaled with internal and external standards </plain></SENT>
