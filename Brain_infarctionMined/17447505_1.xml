<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We report our strategy for malperfusion accompanying <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, especially that involving the abdominal organs, which is based on the mechanism and includes percutaneous management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1991 through October 2005, a total of 38 of 135 (28%) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection presented with organ malperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Altogether, 31 had type A dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The involved vascular territories were coronary in 8, brain in 16, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">celiac</z:e> and superior mesenteric in 6, renal in 10, and lower limb in 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the abdominal organs, the mechanisms of the malperfusion were classified into the aortic type (n = 3) and the branch type (n = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The branch type was further divided into the orifice type (n = 8) and distal type (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one patient with type A dissection underwent a central aortic operation with resection of the entry site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Revascularization of the ischemic organ was added by bypass grafting or direct reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Distal organ malperfusion accompanying type B dissection was treated by the mechanism-specific approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>That is, the aortic type was treated by surgical fenestration, whereas the branch type was treated by percutaneous stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The one hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (2.6%) was due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although a central aortic operation alone successfully reversed aortic-type malperfusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients, it was not effective for branch-type malperfusion in five of six vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Surgical fenestration did not successfully reverse branch-type renal malperfusion in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous stenting was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three vessels with branch-type malperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Central aortic operation or fenestration is effective for aortic-type malperfusion, whereas the branch type may require stenting or bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
