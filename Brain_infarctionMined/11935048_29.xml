<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we sought to investigate the role of proinflammatory molecules in the early worsening and outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of 113 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> included within the first 24 hours of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms in a previous study aimed at investigating clinical and biochemical factors of early neurological deterioration (END) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>END was defined as a fall of &gt; or =1 points in the motor items of Canadian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale between inclusion and 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Poor outcome at 3 months was considered <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or Barthel Index &lt;85 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-6 (IL-6), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were determined by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay in blood samples obtained on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: END was recorded in 27 patients (23.9%); poor outcome was noted in 26 (23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median (quartiles) concentrations in plasma of TNF-alpha [16.5 pg/mL (13.7 and 21.2 pg/mL) versus 7.5 pg/mL (6.2 and 9.0 pg/mL)], IL-6 [28.8 pg/mL (22.5 and 35.7 pg/mL) versus 11.5 pg/mL (8.5 and 16.2 pg/mL)], and ICAM-1 [285 pg/mL (219 and 315 pg/mL) versus 158 pg/mL (137 and 187 pg/mL)] were significantly higher in patients who had END than in those with nonprogressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (P&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were also observed between patients with poor and good outcome at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis after adjustment for potential confounders showed that TNF-alpha &gt;14 pg/mL and ICAM-1 &gt;208 pg/mL were independently associated with both END (OR, 511; 95% CI, 17 to 4937; P&lt;0.001; and OR, 315; 95% CI, 17 to 5748; P&lt; 0.001, respectively) and poor outcome at 3 months (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.0 to 8.5; P=0.042; and OR, 4.2; 95% CI, 1.3 to 13.6; P&lt;0.015, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High concentrations of inflammatory markers in blood are associated with END and poor functional outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> contributes to brain injury in lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
