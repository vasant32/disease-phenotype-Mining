<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of outcome determinants in LI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was a single center observational study and included 163 consecutive patients (108 male, 55 female; mean age 69 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score on admission and the modified Rankin scale (mRS) score at discharge were used to evaluate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We determined the location of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, the grade of white matter hyperintensity (WMH), and the prevalence of silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, and smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared 2 groups, good outcome (mRS score 0-2) and poor outcome (mRS score 3-5), using multiple logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found significant differences between the 2 groups according to female sex (P = .04), WMH (P = .04), and NIHSS score (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After multivariate analysis, female sex (odds ratio [OR] = 3.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-11.4; P = .03), and NIHSS score (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.7-3.3; P &lt; .001) were independently associated with poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elderly <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, poor outcome, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> were more common in female patients, whereas smoking was more prevalent in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that sex differences exist in Japanese LI patients with regard to risk factors and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The treatment of risk factors based on sex differences is important to the management of LI </plain></SENT>
