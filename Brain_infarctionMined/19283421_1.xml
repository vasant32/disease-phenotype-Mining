<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the last several years great progress has been made in the field of ultrasound perfusion imaging of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different approaches have been assessed and shown to be capable of early detection of cerebral perfusion deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Real-time low mechanical index imaging simplifies the acquisition of perfusion parameters and alleviates many of the previous imaging problems related to shadowing, uniplanar analysis, and temporal resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With the advent of this new, highly sensitive contrast-specific imaging technique new possibilities of real-time visualization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> have emerged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microbubbles that traverse the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) can also elicit bioeffects that may be used to open the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> for targeted delivery of macromolecular agents to the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Possible ways in which substances cross the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> after application of this novel approach include transcytosis, passage through endothelial cell cytoplasmic openings, opening of tight junctions, and free passage through injured endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although relatively little tissue damage occurs at low acoustic intensities capable of opening the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>, no investigation has demonstrated a total lack of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> injury when using ultrasound and microbubbles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies are necessary to address the effects of ultrasound and microbubbles upon the various transport mechanisms of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, investigations aimed at elucidating how ultrasound and microbubbles interact at the molecular level of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> are necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results of such studies will increase our understanding of the mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> opening and also allow a better appraisal of the safety of this technique for future clinical applications </plain></SENT>
