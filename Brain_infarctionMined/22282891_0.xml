<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many suffer additional sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Periventricular venous infarction (PVI) is a common fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in which isolated subcortical injury may cause only motor deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, cognitive, language, and behavioral deficits also occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that ipsilesional cortical gray matter volumes are reduced in PVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Children (12 months to 18 years) with MRI-confirmed PVI were identified through the Alberta Perinatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Project </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We developed an MRI method to quantify sectional gray (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes from lesioned and unlesioned (control) hemispheres (OsiriX software) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differences in cortical GM and WM volumes were compared between hemispheres in preselected regions "above" the lesion (middle) and anterior and posterior to this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Outcomes dichotomized for "cortical dysfunction" (cognitive, behavioral, language) and motor deficit severity (Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Outcome Measure) were compared with GM volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-two children (81% boys; median age, 8 years) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Methods demonstrated high intrarater and inter-rater reliabilities (ρ=0.988, ρ=0.943) and minimal observer bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ipsilesional GM volume was significantly reduced in the middle (P=0.007) and posterior (P=0.03) regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Middle ipsilesional WM volumes were reduced (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The degree of GM reduction was not associated with cortical dysfunction or severity of motor deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ipsilesional GM volume is diminished in PVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Speculative mechanisms include retrograde <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> and disrupted migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological testing of larger samples is required to determine clinical significance </plain></SENT>
