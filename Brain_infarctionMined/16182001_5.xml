<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Distal anterior cerebral artery (DACA) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most authors have reported technical difficulties during surgery for these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and a variety of surgical approaches have been advocated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Over a period of 5 years (1999-2003), 67 patients with DACA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were operated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight of these were operated on through the bifrontal basal anterior interhemispheric approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 28 patients, 68% were in poor clinical grade (Hunt and Hess grade III-V) and 89.3% had a Fisher grade III and IV on computed tomography scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A surgical trajectory about 2 to 3 cm superior to the anterior cranial fossa floor led directly to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proximal control was achieved before <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> dissection and parallel clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Good outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale V and IV) was seen in 57.19 of the patients, 14.3% had a poor outcome, and 28.6% died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in most patients was found to be a poor clinical grade, postoperative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, or presence of multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The advantages of the bifrontal basal anterior interhemispheric approach were the following: (a) It provided the shortest and a direct trajectory to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(b) Proximal control of the parent A(2) vessels could be easily achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>(c) Release of cerebrospinal fluid from basal cisterns could be done, if necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>(d) There was a minimal distortion of or traction over the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
