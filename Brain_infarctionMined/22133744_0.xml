<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We clinically evaluated patients with BAD (n = 42) and LI (n = 57) to investigate why patients with BAD tend to experience progressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients presenting to our hospital with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> between April 2008 and March 2009 were screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LI was defined as an intracerebral lesion &lt;15 mm in diameter and fewer than 3 slices or a lesion within the pontine parenchyma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BAD was defined as an intracerebral lesion of â‰¥15 mm in diameter and more than 3 slices or a lesion extending to the surface of the pontine base observed on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Progressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was defined as a &gt;2-point increase in the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale within 48 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Progressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was significantly more prevalent in the BAD group compared with the LI group (38.1% vs 12.3%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When BAD in the cerebrum and BAD in the pons were analyzed separately, a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> level &gt;140 mg/dL was the most prevalent risk factor for progressing BAD in the cerebrum, and patient age was the strongest risk factor for progressing BAD in the pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vascular lesions asvsessed by magnetic resonance angiography were significantly abundant in both progressing LI and BAD </plain></SENT>
