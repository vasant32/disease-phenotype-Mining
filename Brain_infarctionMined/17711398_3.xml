<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurotrophins which promote neuronal survival and plasticity, may protect neurons and enhance remodeling of the remaining circuits, leading to restoration of function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In particular, the crucial role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in cortical function is well documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since BDNF was implicated in the mechanism of postinfarct recovery, we investigated whether focal photothrombosis in the motor cortex of adult rats modifies cortical BDNF protein levels in a time- and region-dependent fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In parallel, we aimed to establish, which cortical cells respond with altered BDNF expression and whether these alterations are reflected by forelimb motor skill impairment and recovery, evaluated up to 1 month postinfarct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distribution of BDNF protein was visualized immunohistochemically and BDNF tissue levels were evaluated with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, an increase in BDNF levels occurred both in injured and neighboring regions already 24 h after photothrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This increase was sustained up to postlesion day 7 in the motor cortex and reduced at 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No BDNF changes were detected in homotopic regions of the contralateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The time-course of enhanced neurotrophic expression was paralleled by bilateral deficits in skilled reaching, which was the only clear and measurable motor impairment observed in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the spontaneous increase of BDNF is not sufficient to protect neurons from degeneration in the lesion proximity whereas plasticity reported in the adjacent regions may be attributable to enhanced BDNF-related stimuli, which do not counteract the impairment of skilled reaching but might be, at least in part, responsible for the absence of deficits in other functional/behavioral tests </plain></SENT>
