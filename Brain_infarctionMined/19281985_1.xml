<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We aimed at associating common osteopontin (OPN) gene variants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> phenotypes.We scanned the OPN gene in 190 chromosomes from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) patients and identified five variants in the promoter, three synonymous and one non-synonymous variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> variants were investigated in case-control studies for MI (ECTIM: 990 cases, 900 controls) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (BI) (GENIC: 466 cases, 444 controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Promoter variants were functionally analyzed by bandshift assays, the coding D147D [T/C] by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Allele D147D C was independently and significantly associated with lower apoB levels (P=0.044 [ECTIM] P=0.03 [GENIC]), its allele frequency was significantly lower in patients with BI compared to controls (OR [95% CI] 0.39 [0.20-0.74], P=0.004), and C allele carriers had a significantly lower frequency of presence of carotid plaques (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bandshifts with HepG2 and Ea.hy926 nuclear proteins did not reveal any functionality of promoter variants, whereas the OPN-441C-containing construct resulted in reduced OPN protein expression in Western blots, complying with its potential protective effect on the phenotypes studied.We here provide evidence that a portion of the OPN locus is likely to associate with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>-related phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, further experiments are warranted to clarify the functional role of OPN variants </plain></SENT>
