<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>Pneumonia</z:hpo> is the reported cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of a high proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Objectives: This study assessed swallowing function to explore the potential risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011951'>aspiration pneumonia</z:hpo> in AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were gathered on 121 AD patients (mean age 78.2, SD 7.5, male/female ratio = 48/73) treated in two psychiatric hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios for the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011951'>aspiration pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following risk factors were considered: age, severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (SBI) in the basel ganglia, use of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35471">psychotropic drugs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="25" ids="35476">neuroleptics</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepines</z:chebi>), and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latency time of the swallowing reflex was analyzed (1) among groups based on the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; (2) between groups with and without SBI in the basal ganglia; (3) before and after the use of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35471">psychotropic drugs</z:chebi> in the group without SBI in the basal ganglia, and (4) between males and females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011951'>Aspiration pneumonia</z:hpo> in ambulatory AD patients was significantly and independently associated with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, presence of SBI in the basal ganglia, intake of <z:chebi fb="25" ids="35476">neuroleptics</z:chebi>, and the male gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean latency of the swallowing reflex in the severe AD group was significantly longer compared to that in the mild-to-moderate AD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean latency of the swallowing reflex after the intake of <z:chebi fb="25" ids="35476">neuroleptics</z:chebi> was significantly prolonged compared to that obtained before any <z:chebi fb="25" ids="35476">neuroleptic</z:chebi> intake, whereas there was no significant difference in the mean latency of the swallowing reflex before and after <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We recommend the use of the smallest efficacious dosage of <z:chebi fb="25" ids="35476">neuroleptics</z:chebi> especially in treating severely <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> AD patients with basal-ganglia infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As soon as the behavioral and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306597" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychiatric problems</z:e> are resolved, drug tapering or discontinuation should be considered in order to prevent life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011951'>aspiration pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
