<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Previous studies of surgical complications associated with posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) are of limited value due to intrastudy variation in instrumentation and fusion techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to examine rates of intraoperative and postoperative complications of PLIF using a large number of cases with uniform instrumentation and a uniform fusion technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors reviewed the hospital records of 251 patients who underwent PLIF for degenerative lumbar disorders between 1996 and 2002 and who could be followed for at least 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative, early postoperative, and late postoperative complications were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative complications occurred in 26 patients: dural tearing in 19 patients and pedicle screw <z:mpath ids='MPATH_79'>malposition</z:mpath> in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative complications did not affect the postoperative clinical results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early postoperative complications occurred in 19 patients: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> occurred in one, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in one, and neurological complications in 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 17 patients with neurological complications, nine showed severe motor loss such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003377'>foot drop</z:hpo>; the remaining eight patients showed slight motor loss or radicular pain alone, and their symptoms improved within 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Late postoperative complications occurred in 17 patients: hardware failure in three, nonunion in three, and adjacent-segment degeneration in 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative progression of symptomatic adjacent-segment degeneration was defined as a condition that required additional surgery to treat neurological deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The most serious complications of PLIF were postoperative severe neurological deficits and adjacent-segment degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prevention and management of such complications are necessary to attain good long-term clinical results </plain></SENT>
