<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To prospectively study the incidence, mechanism, distribution of injury, and outcome of patients admitted to Al-Ain Hospital with camel bite injuries in Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients admitted to Al-Ain Hospital with a camel bite were prospectively studied during the period of October 2001-October 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient's demography, mechanism of injury including behaviour of the camel, distribution and severity of injury, and outcome were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 33 patients were studied having a median (range) age of 27 (10-58), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>97% were from the Indian subcontinent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A majority of injuries (73%) occurred during the camel rutting season (November-March) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients were camel caregivers whilst five were camel jockeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> camel jockeys were children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven patients were raised up by the camel's mouth and thrown to the ground whilst 26 patients were only bitten </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most injuries were in the upper limb (64%) and head and face (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>48% of upper limb injuries had associated fractures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients who were bitten at the neck were admitted to the ICU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One of these died due to massive left-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and the other had complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0002445'>quadriplegia</z:hpo> due to spinal cord injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The median hospital stay was 6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was only one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The behaviour of the camel is occasionally unpredictable, especially during the rutting season </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of camel bite injuries, which are usually severe, are complex including penetrating and crushing injuries by the camel jaw and blunt injuries when patients are picked up and thrown away </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Care should be taken when handling camels, particularly in the rut </plain></SENT>
