<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Right hemisphere dominance in face processing is well established and unilateral right inferior temporo-occipital damage can result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0010528'>prosopagnosia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe a 21-year-old right-handed woman with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> impairment in face recognition that selectively concerned unfamiliar faces, following a focal left lateral temporo-occipital venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She was severely impaired in discerning that unknown people seen in everyday life were unfamiliar, although she had no difficulty recognizing familiar people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, she had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0010528'>prosopagnosia</z:hpo>, but abnormal 'hyperfamiliarity' for unknown faces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Her difficulty was not accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000746'>delusions</z:hpo> or deficits in discrimination, identification or memory for faces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Standard neuropsychological testing showed that her recognition of familiar faces was entirely <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, her sense of personally knowing faces was severely impaired when unknown faces evoked weak signals of familiarity based on spurious cues, to the extent that she would misattribute fame to faces that were unknown but to which she had been incidentally exposed on a prior occasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Priming experiments also revealed that, unlike <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, she made familiarity judgements without accessing semantic identity representations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in face recognition tests, she generally showed bias in that she relied more on right-hemisphere strategies to identify global traits and less on left-hemisphere processes compared with healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This case provides novel evidence for a differential contribution of the two hemispheres to face recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hyperfamiliarity for unknown faces might arise from an imbalance between reciprocal hemispheric functions in face recognition, with relative hypoactivation of left hemisphere processes but hyperactivation of right-hemisphere processes for retrieving stored associations about people, linking seen faces to representations of affective and personal relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hence, abnormal bias in attributing some personal meaning to unknown faces could be evoked by spurious signals of familiarity based on irrelevant affective associations in the right hemisphere </plain></SENT>
