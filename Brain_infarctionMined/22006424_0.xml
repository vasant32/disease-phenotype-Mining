<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Our aims were to (1) assess the corticospinal tracts (CSTs) in infants with focal injury and healthy term controls using probabilistic tractography and (2) to correlate the conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and tractography findings in infants with focal injury with their later motor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 20 infants with focal lesions and 23 controls using MRI and diffusion tensor imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tract volume, fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) values, axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity (RD) of the CSTs were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Asymmetry indices (AIs) were calculated by comparing ipsilateral to contralateral CSTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Motor outcome was assessed using a standardized neurological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Conventional MRI was able to predict <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> motor development (n = 9) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In children who developed a mild motor asymmetry (n = 5), conventional MRI predicted a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> in two and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> motor development in three infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The AIs for tract volume, FA, <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and RD showed a significant difference between controls and infants who developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>, and RD also showed a significant difference in AI between controls and infants who developed a mild asymmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Conventional MRI was able to predict subsequent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> motor development or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> following focal injury in newborn infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Measures of RD obtained from diffusion tractography may offer additional information for predicting a subsequent asymmetry in motor function </plain></SENT>
