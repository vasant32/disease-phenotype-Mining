<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The only causal therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA), but it is feasible only for few patients, and new therapies are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigates the effects of systemic thrombolysis with rtPA combined with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) in embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 22 male Wistar rats, an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were randomized to one of four groups: control, thrombolysis alone, HBOT sequential or HBOT parallel with thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HBOT (2.4 ATA, 1 h) started 45 min (sequential) or 120 min (parallel) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>rtPA was given intravenously 120 min after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional tests were performed after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induction and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 6 h <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and intracerebral hemorrhagic complications were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to the control group only the combination of HBOT and thrombolysis significantly improved the functional outcome (p=0.03) and reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (p=0.01), whereas thrombolysis alone did not show a significant benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment groups there was a trend towards fewer hemorrhagic transformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hyperbaric oxygen in combination with thrombolysis shows neuroprotection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in rats by reducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improving functional outcome in the early poststroke period </plain></SENT>
