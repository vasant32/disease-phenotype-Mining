<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The study aimed to investigate the predictive value of neurobiochemical markers of brain damage (protein S-100B and neuron-specific enolase [NSE]) with respect to early neurobehavioral outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated 58 patients with completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who were admitted to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit of the Department of Neurology at Magdeburg University </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial venous blood samples were taken after admission and during the first 4 days, and protein S-100B and NSE were analyzed by the use of immunoluminometric assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, lesion topography and vascular supply were analyzed and volume of infarcted brain areas was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neurological status was evaluated by a standardized neurological examination and the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) on admission, at days 1 and 4 on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit, at day 10, and at discharge from the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comprehensive neuropsychological examinations were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> event and supratentorial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was measured with the Barthel score at discharge from the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NSE and protein S-100B concentrations were significantly correlated with both volume of infarcted brain areas and NIHSS scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with an adverse neurological outcome had a significantly higher and significantly longer release of both markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological impairment was associated with higher protein S-100B release, but this did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Serum concentrations and kinetics of protein S-100B and NSE have a high predictive value for early neurobehavioral outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Protein S-100B concentrations at days 2 to 4 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may provide valuable information for both neurological status and functional impairment at discharge from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> care hospital </plain></SENT>
