<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No association has been found between ACE and ATG genes polymorphisms and carotid atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of a homozigous DD ACE genotype was shown to be an independent risk factor for development of hemodynamically relevant stenosis of the major brain arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The absence of differences in genetic variants distribution in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, comparing to those with prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> brain ischemic disease (without infarction formation) and the highest frequency of this polymorphism in "longevity" group (without lifetime <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) imply a relatively independent character of the atherothrombogenic process, which may probably underlie a further development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
