<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>Sweating</z:hpo> dysfunction is one of the most frequently encountered symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393911" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic failure</z:e> but has received scant attention in patients with cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to evaluate the prevalence, pathogenesis, and clinical correlates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo> dysfunction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo> at baseline and after a heating stimulus in 53 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hemispheral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and in 40 healthy control subjects by using a quantitative evaporimetric method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>hyperhidrosis</z:hpo> on the paretic side of the body was verified in 55% of the patients at baseline, in 74% after 5 minutes of heating, and in 77% after 10 minutes of heating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>Hyperhidrosis</z:hpo> was established throughout the body and correlated with the severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp>, the presence of reduced muscle tone, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003487'>extensor plantar response</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The phenomenon of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>hyperhidrosis</z:hpo> in hemiparetic patients reflecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> seems to be a common manifestation that should be listed among the expected consequences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo> disturbance might be attributed to a lesion of a putative sympathoinhibitory pathway controlling <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The failure of this pathway could also be related to other manifestations of sympathetic hyperfunction, e.g., cardiac complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo> may provide a new, important aspect in the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
