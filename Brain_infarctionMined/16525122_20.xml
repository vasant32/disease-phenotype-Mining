<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Myocardial injury can occur after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the absence of primary cardiac causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The neuroanatomic basis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related myocardial injury is not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify regions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> associated with myocardial injury using a method free of the bias of an a priori hypothesis as to any specific location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 738 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, the authors identified 50 patients in whom serum cardiac troponin T (cTnT) elevation occurred in the absence of any apparent cause within 3 days of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty randomly selected, age- and sex-matched patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> without cTnT elevation served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted images with outlines of infarction were co-registered to a template, averaged, and then subtracted to find voxels that differed between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Voxel-wise p values were determined using a nonparametric permutation test to identify specific regions of infarction that were associated with cTnT elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study groups were well balanced with respect to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, infarction volume, and frequency of right and left middle cerebral artery territory involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brain regions that were a priori associated with cTnT elevation included the right posterior, superior, and medial insula and the right inferior parietal lobule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751849" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">right middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e>, the insular cluster was involved in 88% of patients with and 33% without cTnT elevation (odds ratio: 15.00; 95% CI: 2.65 to 84.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Infarctions in specific brain regions including the right insula are associated with elevated serum cardiac troponin T level indicative of myocardial injury </plain></SENT>
