<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have reported previously the delayed and differential induction of p38alpha and p38beta <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in microglia and astrocytes, respectively, in brain after transient global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here the sustained induction and activation of p38alpha MAPK in activating microglia in rat brain after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intraventricular administration of SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, 30 min before MCAO reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume to 50% of the control, which was accompanied by the significant improvement of neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More interestingly, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was reduced to 72% and 77% when SB203580 was administered 6 hr and 12 hr after MCAO, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The induction of various factors involved in inflammatory processes, such as inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), was suppressed by the administration of SB203580 at 6 hr after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that sustained activation of p38 MAPK pathway and p38 MAPK-associated inflammatory processes play a crucial role in postischemic brain </plain></SENT>
