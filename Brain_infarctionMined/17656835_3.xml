<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Diffusion tensor image tracography (DTT) could be useful for exploration of the state of the corticospinal tract at the subcortical white matter level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the neural pathway associated with motor recovery in the patients with <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (CR) using DTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Three hemiparetic patients who showed severe <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of the affected upper extremity at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DTT was performed twice (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage) using 1.5-T system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional reconstructions of the fiber tracts were obtained with FA &lt;0.2, angle &gt;45 degrees as termination criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, the motor function of the affected upper extremity has recovered to be functional state at second DTT scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The motor tracts of the affected hemisphere were observed to pass along the posterior portion of the CR <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> on both the first and second DTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It seems that the motor function of the affected upper extremity of the patients recovered via the posterior portion of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding may reflect functional reorganization of the motor pathway following damage to the corticospinal tract </plain></SENT>
