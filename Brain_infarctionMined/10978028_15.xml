<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 350 patients with first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> who presented within 24 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on the OCSP criteria, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> were divided into the following 4 clinical categories: total anterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (TACI), partial anterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (PACI), lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (LACI), and posterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (POCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical deterioration was defined as a decrease of &gt;/=1 points in the Canadian Neurological Scale (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) (in TACI, PACI, and LACI) or Rankin Scale (RS) (in POCI) during 7 days from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each clinical category, deteriorating (D) and nondeteriorating (ND) patients were compared in terms of their background characteristics, risk factors, vital signs, laboratory data, and cranial CT at the time of hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase mortality and functional outcome were also compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The subjects comprised 86 patients (24.6%) with TACI, 63 (18.0%) with PACI, 141 (40.3%) with LACI, and 60 (17.1%) with POCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, 90 patients (25.7%) deteriorated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency was very high in TACI (41.9%), followed by LACI (26.2%) and POCI (21.7%), whereas it was very low in PACI (6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were some clinical variables that differed significantly between D and ND groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the patients with TACI, early abnormalities of the cranial CT and significant stenoses in corresponding arteries were more frequent in the D than the ND group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In those with LACI, the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> and hematocrit were lower in the D than the ND group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In those with POCI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> was more severe and significant stenoses in vertebrobasilar arteries were more frequent in the D than ND group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The mortality of the D groups of patients with TACI and POCI exceeded 35%, and the functional outcome was worse in the D group than in the ND group of patients with TACI, LACI, and POCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of deterioration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> significantly differed among the OCSP subgroups, and deterioration worsened the prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There were some factors that could predict deterioration: early CT findings in TACI, large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in TACI and POCI, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity in LACI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Further research to find sophisticated radiological and chemical markers appears to be needed </plain></SENT>
