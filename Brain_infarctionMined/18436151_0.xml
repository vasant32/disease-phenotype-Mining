<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the findings of TEE in lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Initial symptoms, brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, and TEE were performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> admitted consecutively to our department of neurology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (lacunar v large-vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) was also reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 124 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were identified and lacunar syndrome occurred in 46 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Major risk factor of embolization in patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and indication for anticoagulation were detected in 20% (9 of 46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We compared findings in both groups (lacunar v nonlacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) to evaluate the differences in the presence of major risk factor for embolization, Chi square = 0.07, P = .8 (odds ratio 95% CI = 0.35-2.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Characteristics of the 9 patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and major risk of embolization show that history of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients of this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The results of the study suggest that TEE may be necessary to obtain a complete evaluation to optimize preventive treatment in patients with clinical and radiologic presentation that suggest lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, particularly in cases with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, in which a potential cardiac source of embolization may be detected </plain></SENT>
