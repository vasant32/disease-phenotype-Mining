<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the optimal selection criteria are still being refined and technical improvements are ongoing, rapid imaging of the penumbra appears to be the most promising approach to expanding the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thrombolysis population, as well as tailoring treatment based on specific pathophysiological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This second article in a two-part series reviews current evidence for penumbral-based treatment selection and discusses the barriers to implementation of these advanced imaging techniques in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> management protocols </plain></SENT>
