<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent of patients experienced a second embolism within 2 weeks of the initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preoperative brain CT revealed no hemorrhagic infarction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in 3 of 5 patients with IVD, who had large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, one patient died from massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and two patients from severe brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From these results, we concluded that 1) Open heart surgery within 2 weeks after initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was safe in patients with no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and small non-hemorrhagic infarction, 2) Patients with IVD should be treated surgically before embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, because mortality rate was so high even in patients with non-hemorrhagic infarction </plain></SENT>
