<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The present retrospective study tries to define more specifically the clinical and the neuroimaging characteristics of the five most classic LSs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Out of a series of 1617 consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, admitted to the Ghent University Hospital, 293 presented a classic LS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was performed within 5 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in 227 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> territorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was demonstrated in 54 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study population finally consisted of 173 patients with a classic LS in whom the responsible lacune was demonstrated or in the absence of another type of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The responsible lacune was demonstrated with DWI in 104 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pure motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (MS) correlated significantly with the presence of the responsible lacune in the internal capsule (P = 0.000147) and with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity (P = 0.00724) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was observed between the location of the lacunes and the other LS's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pure MS has to be considered as the most specific lacunar syndrome </plain></SENT>
