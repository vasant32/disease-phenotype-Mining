<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The present study included 92 patients with a first-ever symptomatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, of whom 25 (27%) were subjected to rt-PA treatment in the first three hours post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analyses adjusted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity, education, age, and sex were performed to examine whether rt-PA treatment influenced cognitive outcome (assessed with a neuropsychological examination covering 7 cognitive domains), basic ADL independence (modified Barthel Index &gt; or = 19), and instrumental ADL independence (Frenchay Activities Index &gt; or = 15) after six months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratio for intact cognition was 1.0 (95% CI 0.2 to 4.3), that for basic ADL outcome 13.5 (95 % CI 1.4 to 129.4) and for instrumental ADL 7.1 (95 % CI 1.2 to 42.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that rt-PA treatment is associated with a favourable basic and instrumental ADL outcome, but not with a beneficial cognitive outcome after 6 months </plain></SENT>
