<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the association between the Gly460Trp polymorphism and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, and cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery, as well as incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, were studied within 6471 subjects of the Rotterdam Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within 1018 subjects of the Rotterdam Scan Study, prevalent silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and cerebral white matter lesions were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were grouped into 460Trp carriers (variant carriers) and homozygous carriers of the Gly460 allele (reference) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery was 0.80 mm in variant carriers compared with 0.79 mm in the reference group (P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Variant carriers had an increased risk of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (hazard ratio [HR], 1.22; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.45), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.63), hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.92), and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For any <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, there was a significant interaction between the Gly460Trp polymorphism and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Variant carriers more often had a silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (odds ratio, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.88) and had more subcortical white matter lesions than the reference group (1.45 vs1.24 mL; P=0.22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Gly460Trp polymorphism is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, and cerebrovascular disease, especially in hypertensive subjects </plain></SENT>
