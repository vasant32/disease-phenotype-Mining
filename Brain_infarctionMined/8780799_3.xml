<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats kept in an enriched environment before and after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> ligation improved sooner and slightly more than those placed in the enriched environment after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> but with no lasting significant difference except for climbing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preliminary studies suggest that social stimulation is more important than physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats with fetal neocortical grafts implanted into the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cavity performed better if exposed to enriched environment than grafted control rats housed in standard laboratory cages with 5 rats in each cage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, they did not perform better than non-grafted rats housed in the same enriched environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size did not differ between rats housed in an enriched environment and control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and performance in rats exposed to an enriched environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The improved motor function suggest that a rich environment may stimulate mechanisms that enhance brain plasticity </plain></SENT>
