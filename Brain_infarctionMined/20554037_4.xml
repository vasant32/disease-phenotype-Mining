<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested whether Niaspan administered acutely after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is neuroprotective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male rats (n=8/group) were subjected to 2h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) and treated with or without different doses of Niaspan (20, 40 or 80 mg/kg) at 2 and 24h after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A battery of functional outcome tests was performed, and serum <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were sacrificed at 7 days after MCAo and lesion volumes were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The optimal dose of Niaspan treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was chosen for immunostaining: deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling (TUNEL), cleaved caspase-3, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNF-alpha), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p-PI3K) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Another set of rats (n=4/group) were killed at 7 days after MCAo for Western blot assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Niaspan dose-dependently reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improved functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels was detected between Niaspan treatments and MCAo control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Niaspan treatment significantly decreased the number of TUNEL-positive cells (105+/-17) and cleaved caspase-3 expression (381+/-33) in the ischemic brain compared to MCAo control (165+/-18; 650+/-61, respectively; p&lt;or=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Niaspan treatment significantly reduced the expression of TNF-alpha (9.7+/-1.1% vs. 16+/-2.2%; p&lt;or=0.05) and negative correlations were observed between the functional tests and the expression of TNF-alpha (r=-0.71, p&lt;or=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Niaspan treatment also significantly increased the expression of VEGF (5.2+/-0.9%) and PI3K/Akt (0.381+/-0.04%) in the ischemic brain compared with non-treated MCAo control (2.6+/-0.4%; 0.24+/-0.03, respectively; p&lt;or=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The functional outcome was positively correlated with p-PI3K (r=0.7, p&lt;or=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with Niaspan at 2h after MCAo reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improves neurological outcome and provides neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effects of Niaspan were associated with reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and attenuation of TNF-alpha expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>VEGF and the PI3K/Akt pathway may contribute to the Niaspan-induced neuroprotection after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
