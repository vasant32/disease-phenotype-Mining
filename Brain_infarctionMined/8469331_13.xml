<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We compared clinical and radiologic features between 246 cardiac embolism (EMB) and 66 arterial embolic (tandem arterial pathology [TAP]) patients selected from the 1,273 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Data Bank </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic definitions accounted for the increased frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> among patients with EMB compared with TAP (78.4% versus 29.3%), while <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (32.3% versus 13.1%) and carotid artery bruit (15.1% versus 3.3%) were more prevalent in TAP than in EMB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression differentiated TAP and EMB further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The probability of a TAP diagnosis was increased by the CT finding of a superficial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> alone (odds ratio [OR] = 4.6; 95% CI = 1.5 to 13.7) or by a higher admission hematocrit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The probability of EMB was greater in patients with an initial decreased consciousness (OR = 39.2; 95% CI = 4.0 to 381.3) or with an abnormal first CT (OR = 3.2; 95% CI = 1.2 to 8.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the two <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> subtypes differ in the location and extent of the cortical infarction, which argues for a smaller particle size, with smaller and more distal infarction in embolism from an arterial source compared with cardiogenic embolism </plain></SENT>
