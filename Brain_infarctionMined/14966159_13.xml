<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the distribution of these lesions has not been compared with that of lacunes, which represent occlusive type <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To compare the cerebral distribution of microbleeds and lacunes and correlate their severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population comprised 129 hypertensive patients who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including gradient echo (GE) sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral microbleeds were counted using GE-MRI data, and lacunes were also counted by comparing T1 and T2 weighted MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To investigate the distributions, the number of patients with each type of lesion was compared, and the occurrence index (the total number of the specific lesions divided by the total number of patients) was examined statistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correlation analyses were done on the relations between the different grades of microbleeds, lacunes, and leukoaraiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cerebral microbleeds and lacunes were found at various foci in the brain, with a preference for the cortico-subcortical region and the deep grey matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The occurrence index of microbleeds, but not of lacunes, was significantly higher in the cortico-subcortical region than in the deep grey matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The severity of the microbleeds was positively correlated with the severity of lacunes, and both types of lesion were closely correlated with the degree of leukoaraiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that microbleeds and lacunes tend to occur to a similar extent in long standing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, but not necessarily in the same locations </plain></SENT>
