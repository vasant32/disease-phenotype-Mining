<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subsequent disseminated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> in a heatstroke patient has been also described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28793">Beta-D-glucan</z:chebi>, a constituent of the fungal cell wall, is an early diagnostic measure for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a heatstroke case, we examined for the first time levels of serum beta-d-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37163">glucan</z:chebi> and endotoxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 34-year-old man with a body temperature of 43.5 degrees C was admitted in a state of shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prior to the development of disseminated intravascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>), a remarkable elevation of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28793">beta-D-glucan</z:chebi> level to 116 pg/mL (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level&lt;6.0 pg/mL) was revealed on the first day of admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, serum endotoxin was not detected when using a method that excluded <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28793">beta-D-glucan</z:chebi> contamination from endotoxin measurement (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level&lt;1.0 pg/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This change of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28793">beta-D-glucan</z:chebi> level was accompanied by a depressed neutrophil function, especially in phagocytosis of 34% (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range 70-90%) but not in bacterocidal function (81% versus a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range of 70-100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After intensive care including continuous hemodiafiltration, the patient regained consciousness but remained ataxic due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e>, which might have resulted from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>, and subsequent bilateral fungal oculitis were revealed 45 days after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This case report demonstrates the elevation of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28793">beta-D-glucan</z:chebi> but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> endotoxin levels after heatstroke, which may prompt further study to re-examine the serum levels of endotoxin in such catastrophic insults </plain></SENT>
