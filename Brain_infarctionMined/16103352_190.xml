<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi> results in loss of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential, expansion of the matrix, and rupture of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> outer membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consequently, PT has been implicated in both apoptotic and necrotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cyclophilin D (CypD) appears to be a critical component of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of CypD in cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, we created a CypD-deficient mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro, CypD-deficient mitochondria showed an increased capacity to retain calcium and were no longer susceptible to PT induced by the addition of calcium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CypD-deficient primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were as susceptible to classical apoptotic stimuli as the WT, suggesting that CypD is not a central component of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in response to these specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, CypD-deficient MEFs were significantly less susceptible than their WT counterparts to cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced by <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi>, implicating CypD in <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, CypD-deficient mice displayed a dramatic reduction in brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion, strongly supporting an essential role for CypD in an ischemic injury model in which calcium overload and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> have been implicated </plain></SENT>
