<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used intracerebral microdialysis to monitor the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> treatment on the release of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> and on the levels of the energy metabolites <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In male rats subjected to 90 min of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 24-h reperfusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> (0.8 mg/kg, i.v.) at the time of occlusion reduced the ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> by about 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In these treated rats, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced increases of extracellular levels of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> were significantly and rapidly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reduction of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level during occlusion was not affected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> treatment; however, the increase of extracellular <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> was reduced during occlusion and reperfusion, probably due to the reduced <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-driven astrocytic glycolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of occlusion significantly reduces the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced excitotoxicity in the cortex, a mechanism that may participate in the neuroprotective effect on cellular survival </plain></SENT>
