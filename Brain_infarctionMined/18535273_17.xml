<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Early hemorrhagic transformation (HT) is a complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> but its effect on patient outcome is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to assess: (1) the rate of early HT in patients admitted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, (2) the correlation between early HT and functional outcome at 3 months, and (3) the risk factors for early HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were included in this prospective study in 4 study centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early HT was assessed by CT examination performed at day 5+/-2 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Study outcomes were 3-month mortality or disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disability was assessed using a modified Rankin score (&gt; or = 3 indicating disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) by neurologists unaware of the occurrence of HT in the individual cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcomes in patients with and without early HT were compared by chi(2) test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors for HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 1125 consecutive patients (median age 76.00 years), 98 (8.7%) had HT, 62 (5.5%) had hemorrhagic infarction, and 36 (3.2%) parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 3 months, 455 patients (40.7%) were disabled or died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> or disability was seen in 33 patients with parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> (91.7%), in 35 patients with hemorrhagic infarction (57.4%) as compared with 387 of the 1021 patients without HT (37.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At logistic regression analysis, parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, but not hemorrhagic infarction, was independently associated with an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or disability (OR 15.29; 95% CI 2.35 to 99.35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At logistic regression analysis, parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> was predicted by large lesions (OR 12.20, 95% CI 5.58 to 26.67), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> attributable to cardioembolism (OR 5.25; 95% CI 2.27 to 12.14) or to other causes (OR 6.77; 95% CI 1.75 to 26.18), high levels of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (OR 1.01; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.01), and thrombolytic treatment (OR 3.54, 95% CI 1.04 to 11.95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early HT occurs in about 9% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, seen in about 3% of patients, is associated with an adverse outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> was predicted by large lesions attributable to cardioembolism or other causes, high blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and treatment with thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
