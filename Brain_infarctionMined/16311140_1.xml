<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Lacunes are small deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> due to occlusion of long-perforating arterial branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentation and outcome are variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigates the prognostic value of comparing repeated computed tomographic (CT) scans in patients with a lacunar syndrome (LACS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From a series of 220 patients, subsequently admitted with a first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 32 were diagnosed as LACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CT scans without contrast enhancement were performed on day 3 and 10 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A lacune was considered as responsible for the LACS when its location corresponded to the expected cerebral hemisphere and when it changed in size and/or in X-ray attenuation on the CT scans from day 3 to 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The size of the lacune was also measured and compared on both time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into two groups according to the modified Rankin (R) scale at 3 months, in those who were independent (R 0-1-2) and in those who remained handicapped (R 3-4-5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients who remained disabled at 3 months were older and more severely impaired on admission, and had more frequent cardiac problems and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> than the independent ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On CT scans of the brain a higher incidence of leukoaraiosis was observed in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only in three patients of each group no relevant lacune could be observed both on day 3 and 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The average size of the symptomatic lacune on day 3 and 10 was not statistically different between both groups, when comparing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with a LACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When comparing only those patients with a visible symptomatic lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> on one of the CT scans, however, the average size of the symptomatic deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was smaller in the independent than the handicapped patients on day 3 as well as on day 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The lacune decreased in average size from day 3 to 10 in the former group but remained unchanged in the group of disabled patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The outcome of patients with a LACS depends on several factors including age, cognitive and cardiac status, the presence of leukoaraiosis and also the size of the symptomatic lacune </plain></SENT>
