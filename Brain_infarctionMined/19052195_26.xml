<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In non-neuronal systems, Hsp27 has potent cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-suppressing functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism of Hsp27-mediated neuroprotection has not yet been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using transgenic and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> overexpression of Hsp27, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which Hsp27 exerts its neuroprotective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of Hsp27 conferred long-lasting tissue preservation and neurobehavioral recovery, as measured by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, sensorimotor function, and cognitive tasks up to 3 weeks following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Examination of signaling pathways critical to neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> demonstrated that Hsp27 overexpression led to the suppression of the MKK4/JNK kinase cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While Hsp27 overexpression did not suppress activation of an upstream regulatory kinase of the MKK/JNK cascade, ASK1, Hsp27 effectively inhibited ASK1 activity via a physical association through its N-terminal domain and the kinase domain of ASK1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The N-terminal region of Hsp27 was required for neuroprotective function against in vitro <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, knockdown of ASK1 or inhibition of the ASK1/MKK4 cascade effectively inhibited cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> following neuronal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This underscores the importance of this kinase cascade in the progression of ischemic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of PI3K had no effect on Hsp27-mediated neuroprotection, suggesting that Hsp27 does not promote cell survival via activation of PI3K/Akt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, we conclude that overexpression of Hsp27 confers long-lasting neuroprotection against ischemic brain injury via a previously unexplored association and inhibition of ASK1 kinase signaling </plain></SENT>
