<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a cytokine involved in the bone metabolism and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004934'>vascular calcification</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent data support a relationship between high serum levels of OPG and increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in human </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the OPG serum levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our study was further designed to detect differences in serum OPG levels between subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study consisted of 51 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and 28 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> subtypes were defined by the TOAST classifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum OPG levels were measured with the ELISA method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: OPG serum levels were significantly higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> than in control subjects (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>OPG serum levels were significantly higher in large-vessel disease (LVD) subtype compared with small-vessel disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>) subtype and controls (p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in OPG serum levels between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> group and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Serum OPG levels were correlated with age (r=0.407, p=0.005) and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (r=0.542, p=0.001) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis showed that plasma OPG levels (OR 2.1, 95% CI, 1.16 to 3.4, p=0.01) associated with presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> independently of the other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High serum OPG levels were associated with the LVD <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype, suggesting that OPG levels may play role in pathogenesis of atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The precise mechanism for the role of OPG in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> needs to be investigated further </plain></SENT>
