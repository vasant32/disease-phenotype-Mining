<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present the results of a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to assess the safety and potential protective effects of DP-b99 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and fifty <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with signs of cortical involvement and a National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score of 7 to 20 received a 4-day course of intravenous 1 mg/kg per day DP-b99 or placebo within 1 to 9 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator was not allowed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No major differences in mortality rate, causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, adverse events, safety laboratory tests, and ECG parameters were found between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The baseline NIHSS score of the 72 DP-b99- and 75 placebo-treated patients in the intent-to-treat cohort was (mean+/-SD) 12.2+/-4.0 and 12.6+/-3.3, respectively; the time to needle (mean+/-SD) was 6:36+/-1:47 and 6:28+/-1:33 hours, respectively; and the age (mean+/-SD) was 73.3+/-9.9 and 72.0+/-9.6 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 90-day median change from baseline (the primary end point) was -6.0 and -5.0 NIHSS points in the DP-b99 and placebo groups, respectively (nonsignificant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 90 days, there was a significantly better outcome in the DP-b99 group compared with the placebo group (modified Rankin scale score of 0, 1, or same as prestroke): 30.6% and 16.0%, respectively (P=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The recovery rate was unaffected by the time to needle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further analyses indicated that the 90-day median change from baseline in patients with an entry NIHSS score of 10 to 16 was 8.0 and 5.0 points in the DP-b99 and placebo groups, respectively (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this small-scale study, the primary end point of change in NIHSS score from baseline to 90 days was not met </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, secondary end points demonstrated a significantly improved 90-day recovery rate with treatment with DP-b99 when compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, in patients with baseline NIHSS scores of 10 to 16, a significant post hoc change in NIHSS score from baseline to day 90 was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No major safety problems were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings need to be confirmed with a larger prospective study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> involving the cortex </plain></SENT>
