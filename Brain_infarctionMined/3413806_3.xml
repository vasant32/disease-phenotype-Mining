<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We followed 54 subjects with heterozygous familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> for an average of 10 (range 3-14) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Half were treated surgically with partial ileal bypass and the other half (matched for age, sex, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, blood pressure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and serum cholesterol concentration) were treated conservatively with diet and hypolipidemic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean decrease in serum cholesterol concentration from the average value of 522 mg/dl on entry into the study was 32% in the surgically treated group and 10% in the conservatively treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One quarter of the subjects (14 of 54) had symptomatic cerebrovascular disorders and one tenth (six of 54) suffered a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> at a mean age of 43 (range 30-57) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two thirds of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> occurred during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The method of treatment of familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> did not affect the number of new cerebrovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was 7.4/1000/yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in these subjects with familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> was at least 20 times higher than in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that symptomatic subjects with familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> have not only a high risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> but also a high risk of cerebrovascular disorders </plain></SENT>
