<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To report our first-in-man experience with a new cerebral embolic deflection device (SMT Embolic Deflection Device) during transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A significant number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are caused by embolisation of atherosclerotic material, clots and other debris during various phases of invasive cardiac procedures, especially TAVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The application of a temporary filter in the aortic arch averting dislodged emboli from entering the cerebral circulation might prevent this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In 15 patients (mean age 79 years) with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> undergoing percutaneous transfemoral or transapical aortic valve implantation, the SMT Embolic Deflection Device was advanced utilising the contralateral femoral artery access using a 9 Fr delivery sheath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Once deployed in the aortic arch, a porous membrane shields the supraaortic-cerebral trunks by deflecting emboli away from the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Embolic material is not contained or removed by the device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 6 Fr pigtail catheter can be used through the same sheath throughout the whole procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain diffusion weighted (DW)-MRI was obtained in 10 patients before and at 4 days after (± 2 days) the procedure and retrospectively compared to 20 patients previously undergoing TAVI without a protection device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Successful placement of the embolic protection device was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional procedural time due to the use of the device was 7 min (± 2 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no procedural complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No patient developed new neurological symptoms or clinical findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> except one patient who suffered from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) two days after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DW-MRI showed 3.2 new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> per patient, compared to 7.2 new lesions per patient in the group without SMT filter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this first-in-man experience, the feasibility of a new embolic deflection device is demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Larger randomised, prospective studies are required to confirm these findings and prove safety and efficacy by reducing the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after TAVI </plain></SENT>
