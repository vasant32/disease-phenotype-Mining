<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the prevalence of silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, which is reported to be about 17-20% in American patients, has not been documented in adult Kuwaiti patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is a 1-year study of consecutive, asymptomatic SCD patients seen in the hematology clinic of Mubarak Al-Kabeer Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with a past history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> or any other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurological abnormality</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients' charts were reviewed for frequency of hospitalizations, any documented complications, and steady-state CBC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI was done with a 1.5-Tesla unit with super-conducting magnet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>T1- and T2-weighted sagittal and axial sections and proton-density axial images were obtained in 5-mm-thick sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients were studied, made up of 25 SS and 10 Sbeta(0)Thal, aged between 17 and 44 years, with a mean age of 26.9 +/- 9.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MRI findings consistent with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were found in 7 (20.0%) patients-6 SS and 1 Sbeta(0)thal-with a mean age of 31.8 +/- 8.2 years, which was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) than the mean age of the unaffected group (25.1 - 9.0 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were also no differences in the mean Hb, Hb F, or any other hematological parameter in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the affected 6 SS, 2 had co-existent alpha-thal trait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is interesting that, while silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are prevalent in young American patients, it is in the older age group that they occur in Kuwaiti patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to investigate the factors modulating this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
