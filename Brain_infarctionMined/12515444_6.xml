<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Twenty-eight patients were studied with the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic middle cerebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, within the first 72 hours of clinical evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven EEGs and clinical evaluations were collected: 13 during the first 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, 9 between 24-48 hours and 15 between 48-72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The QEEG studied variables were: the Z values (maximum, minimum and the Z medians from the 5 nearest points to each one) of absolute energies (AE) from the 4 classic frequencies bands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical scale showed a smaller percent of correct prognosis than QEEG variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: QEEG was demonstrated to be a powerful tool to predict the degree of residual functional disabilities after an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and showed a higher prognostic value than CaNS when they are performed within the first 72 hours of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
