<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> trials with stem cell-based approaches aiming for trophic actions, modulation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and neuroprotection are ongoing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, experimental studies also suggest that neuronal replacement by grafted neural stem cells (NSCs) and possibly by endogenous NSCs from the subventricular zone (SVZ) may restore function in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-damaged striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the potential clinical impact of these findings, we analyzed the spatial relationship of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> to the SVZ and the proportion of individuals with striatal lesions in a consecutive series of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients aged 20-75 years with first-ever ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> underwent DW-MRI of the brain within 4 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed location, size, number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> focal ischaemic abnormalities and their spatial relationship to the SVZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> severity was assessed using NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 108 included patients, the distance from the nearest margin of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>(s) to the SVZ was ≤2 mm in 51/102 patients with visible ischaemic lesions on DW-MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients had involvement of striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight of these had predominantly striatal lesions, that is &gt;50% of the total ischaemic lesion volume was located in caudate nucleus and/or putamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These 8 patients had a median NIHSS of 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Many <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> located close to the SVZ, providing some supportive evidence that optimized endogenous neurogenesis may have therapeutic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, predominantly striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are rare and tend to give mild neurological deficits, indicating that striatum should not be the primary target for neuronal replacement efforts in humans </plain></SENT>
