<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ischemic preconditioning is considered to be the most robust endogenous neuroprotectant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the conventional ischemic preconditioning protocol is both invasive and impractical to apply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether preconditioning with +Gz centrifuge acceleration (head-to-foot inertial load) which could induce brief episodes of sublethal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in brain had neuroprotection against focal cerebral ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 85 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to five groups (n = 17 in each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 2 Gz, 4 Gz, 6 Gz and 8 Gz groups were subjected to 3 min exposures at +2 Gz, +4 Gz, +6 Gz and +8 Gz, respectively for consecutive three times in animal centrifuge, with a 30-min rest period between each centrifuge run </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The control group had no exposure to +Gz acceleration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after the last pretreatment, 12 rats in each groups were subjected to focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> for 120 min and the other five rats in each group were sacrificed to measure the expression of heat shock protein 70(HSP70) in hippocampus by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that the 6 Gz and 8 Gz groups showed smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and lower neurologic deficit scores than the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of HSP70 was significantly increased in 6 Gz and 8 Gz groups than those in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, preconditioning with +Gz acceleration produced delayed neuroprotection against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and that the neuroprotection may be related to the induction of HSP70 </plain></SENT>
