<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SHR with MCAO were randomly assigned to receive intravenously transplantation of vehicle, the plasmid containing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (pEGFP)-CD34+ cells or pEGFP-GDNF-CD34+ cells at 6h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CD34+ cells transfected with GDNF gene expressed higher levels of GDNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein than nontransfected HUCB CD34+ cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 28 days after transplantation of GDNF gene modified CD34+ cells, significantly more GFP positive cells, neurons, and astrocytes, likely derived from the grafted cells, populated the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area compared to those injected with pEGFP-CD34+ cells or vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> animals transplanted with GDNF gene modified CD34+ cells showed a significant increase in GDNF level in the infarcted hemisphere, reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> volume, and enhanced functional recovery compared with those that received pEGFP-CD34+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study supports the use of a combined gene and stem cell therapy for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
