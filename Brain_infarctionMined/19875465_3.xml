<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CT perfusion (<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi>) mapping has been reported to be useful in the differentiation of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core and ischemic penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the value of the <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> source imaging (<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi>-SI) during the arterial and venous phases has not been fully investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to develop a <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi>-SI methodology for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and compare its efficacy with cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) in predicting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core and penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: CT examinations, including non-contrast-enhanced CT, <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi>, and CT angiography (CTA), were performed in 42 patients with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> for &lt;9 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Alberta <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) was analyzed on the arterial phase <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi>-SI and venous phase <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi>-SI and then compared with the ASPECTS on CBF and CBV for efficacy assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ASPECTS on the arterial phase <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi>-SI was closely correlated with the ASPECTS on CBF, the Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.88 (P &lt; .001), and the concordance correlation coefficient was 0.7603 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6331-0.8476) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ASPECTS on the venous phase <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi>-SI revealed a significant correlation with the ASPECTS on CBV, the Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.92 (P &lt; .001), and the concordance correlation coefficient was 0.8880 (95% CI, 0.8148-0.9334) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were shown between the arterial phase <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi>-SI/ venous phase <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi>-SI (P &lt; .001) and CBF/CBV (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that the arterial phase and venous phase <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi>-SI mismatch model could possibly be applied to ischemic regions in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to determine penumbra and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core </plain></SENT>
