<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The proportion of patients compliant with prevention of risk factors (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>) was evaluated through structured telephone interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the consecutive patients admitted to the neurological department of Tiantan Hospital between Oct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2002 and Apr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2003, 374 patients were involved in this investigation and 296 (79.1%) were finally evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 296 (79.1%) patients, the rate of antithrombotic drug compliance was 35.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, 77.9%, 80.2%, and 48.4% were still treated for their respective risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Influence factors for drug compliance, such as medical insurance and free medical care (OR 2.117, 95% CI 1.174-3.821) can promote the drug compliance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, while the use of antithrombotic drugs other than aspirin (OR 0.352, 95% CI 0.153-0.812) and a lower living ability (62.5 +/- 13.3) (Mann-Whitney-P = 0.000) could decrease the drug compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-term compliance with secondary prevention in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is poor in the setting of our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Poor compliance with antithrombotic therapy such as incorrect discontinuation or change and reduction of dosage was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Means of payment, income levels, categories of antithrombotic drugs and personal living ability of patients are associated with compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Doctors should attach importance to secondary prevention and provide <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients detailed guidelines for the use of preventive drugs </plain></SENT>
