<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen patients with poor-grade SAH without intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A significant change in monitored variables (arterial gases, ICP, brain-tissue oxygen pressure [Ptio(2)], brain-tissue carbon dioxide pressure, and pH) was defined as a register deviation of more than 20% compared with the baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Critical Ptio(2) values (&lt;15 mm Hg) or significant Ptio(2) decreases were considered to be impaired brain oxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data were correlated with the angiography findings and the presence of massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and hypodense areas in follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neurotrend data were unavailable in 4 patients because of calibration failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Impaired brain oxygenation during angiography was observed in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Initial critical Ptio(2) values were found in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients developed a linear Ptio(2) and pH decrease after the angio-catheter canalized the examined vessels in the neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant correlation was found between brain pH and Ptio(2) changes in these patients (P &lt; .001, Spearman rho) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Arterial gases, ICP, and cerebral perfusion pressure did not show significant alterations at this time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations existed between severe intracranial angiographic arterial caliber reduction and impaired Ptio(2) values (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with impaired Ptio(2) values frequently showed lesions in CT scan controls (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study documented several fluctuations in the brain oxygenation of patients with poor-grade SAH during angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with severe intracranial angiographic arterial caliber reduction at this time have an increased risk for impaired brain oxygenation </plain></SENT>
