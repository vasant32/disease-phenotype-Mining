<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the effects of VIP on transient ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced using middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 120 min in the adult rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Either a single intracerebroventricular injection of VIP or saline was given at the beginning of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight hours after MCAO, the rats were sacrificed for evaluation of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and histological analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ELISA was performed to assay levels of serum S100B before being sacrificed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) permeability using Evans blue dye injection method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the cases treated with vehicle, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and immunoreactivity for S100B were also significantly (P&lt;0.05) decreased in the ischemic hemisphere with VIP treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the elevations of serum S100B were significantly (P&lt;0.01) attenuated in VIP-treated rats compared with those of control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment with VIP did not result in a significant reduction of Evans blue leakage, although it tended to be lower than that in the control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that treatment with VIP reduces brain damage in ischemic rats, and this effect may be associated with the attenuation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and S100B expression </plain></SENT>
