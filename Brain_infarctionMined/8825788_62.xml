<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen litters of postnatal d 7 strain 218/3 mice were subjected to right common carotid artery ligation followed by 90 min of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> in an 8% oxygen/humidified chamber maintained at 37 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both Tg mice (n = 32) and their nontransgenic (nTg) littermates (n = 30) survived the injury equally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of infarcted brain areas measured by video image analysis of three coronal brain sections through the anterior hippocampus from each animal revealed that the Tg animals suffered <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> more frequently than did nTg mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blinded histologic scoring of cerebral cortex and striatum 5 d after injury revealed that Tg mice were more likely to have higher histologic severity scores than their nTg littermates (p = 0.0463, Mann-Whitney U test) </plain></SENT>
