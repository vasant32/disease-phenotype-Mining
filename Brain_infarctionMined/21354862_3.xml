<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objectives were to analyze the association between TLR3, 7, 8 and 9 expressions and clinical outcome in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and the expression of inflammatory molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred-ten patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were included within 12h of symptoms <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> severity was evaluated by the NIHSS, and functional outcome was assessed at 3 months by the modified Rankin Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume at 4-7 days was measured on Computed Tomography imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TLR7 and TLR8 at different time points were independently associated with poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TLR8 was also correlated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, TLR7 and TLR8 on admission were correlated with levels of IL6 and IL1Î² at 24h, 72 h and 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, TLR 7 and TLR8 expressions are associated with poor outcome and greater <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
