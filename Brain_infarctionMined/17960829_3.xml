<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it mimics conditions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e>, one of the most frequent human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Doublecortin (DCX)-positive cells were present in the neocortex and corpus callosum at the base of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of DCX-positive cells in the corpus callosum was significantly increased from day 5 to day 14 compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there were no DCX-positive cells in neocortex of control animals; the DCX-positive cells appeared in the neocortex after lesioning and were maintained until 14 days postlesioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some of the DCX-positive cells were also immunoreactive for beta III-tubulin, another marker of immature neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They did not stain positively for markers of glia cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of these DCX-positive cells near the lesion might indicate a migratory pathway for developing neuroblasts from the subventricular zone (SVZ) through the corpus callosum to the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SVZ cells were labeled with a lipophilic molecule, 5- (and 6-) carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> (CFSE) stereotaxical injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although rostral migratory stream and olfactory bulb were intensely labeled, no CFSE-containing cells were found in the cortex beneath the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results do not support the idea that the DCX-positive cells were originating from neural precursors of the SVZ, but they might be generated from local progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
