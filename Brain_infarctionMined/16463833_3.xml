<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We evaluated the perioperative and intraoperative changes of intracranial pressure (ICP) and partial pressure of brain tissue oxygen (PtiO2) after decompressive craniectomy in patients with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedema</z:hpo> and space occupying infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients suffering from medically intractable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> (ICP) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The underlying diseases and causes for elevated ICP were diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedema</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (n = 3) and head injury (n = 3), or space occupying infarction of the middle cerebral artery territory due to vasospasm after SAH (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Continuous perioperative and intraoperative monitoring of PtiO2 and ICP was performed at the side of decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: ICP and PtiO2 improved significantly in a uniform pattern during bone flap removal and dura opening, irrespective of the underlying disease (mean ICP from 52 mmHg to 8 mmHg, mean PtiO2 from 9 mmHg to 25 mmHg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ICP, PtiO2, and cerebral perfusion pressure were further improved in the subsequent 12 hours after surgery, as compared to the preoperative 12 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Decompressive craniectomy seems to be a successful option in the treatment of intractable intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> with associated cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These positive effects may last for several hours after the procedure irrespective of the underlying disease </plain></SENT>
