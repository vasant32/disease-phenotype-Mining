<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the recent introduction of in vivo NMR imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS), it is now possible to evaluate the consequences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and to monitor the effects of therapeutic interventions in animals with the same methodology as in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The appearance and evolution of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), were detected with MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In coronal sections through the rat brain, regions with increased MRI signal started to become discernible after 6 h and turned out to be largely necrotic already after 24 h, as revealed by histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The location (fronto-parietal cortex, caudate-putamen) and total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, as determined from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images or histology, were highly reproducible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Posttreatment with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50075">dihydropyridine</z:chebi> calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> isradipine (PN 200-110), at a daily dose of 3 X 0.3 mg/kg sc, reduced the total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size by 30-40%, determined by quantitative MRI and confirmed by histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biochemical markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, such as the increased brain wet wt, the levels of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi>, were changed toward <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The functional consequences of these morphological effects of isradipine were reflected by the parallel improvement of a neurological score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up observations made by MRI and histology indicated that the morphological differences between treated and control animals were still present to the same extent after 2 wk and, therefore, seem to be permanent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In order to elucidate the putative mechanisms involved, the influence of calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and high energy phosphates (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="48293">HEPs</z:chebi>) was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CBF was measured quantitatively with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36927">[14C]</z:chebi> iodoantipyrine in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-occluded SHRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although isradipine had no effect on CBF in the contralateral hemisphere, at a dose reducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, it increased the reduced blood flow in the lesioned hemisphere toward <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="48293">HEPs</z:chebi> (PCr and ATP) as well as inorganic phosphate (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e>) and intracellular pH were measured noninvasively in the rat brain by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37971">31P</z:chebi> MRS using a surface coil </plain></SENT>
