<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, hospital-based study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Department of Neurology of a university medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Forty-two patients with essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and 45 patients who were normotensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Extent of autonomic activation following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as indicated by circadian blood pressure patterns, serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> levels, and cardiovascular variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Normotensive patients with insular infarction showed a significantly reduced circadian blood pressure variation and a higher frequency of nocturnal blood pressure increase compared with patients suffering from essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and insular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings were also associated with higher serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> concentrations and more frequent electrocardiographic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant changes in these variables were seen between normotensive and hypertensive patients without insular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a difference in cortical control of autonomic function between hypertensive and normotensive patients after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and point to a possible role of the insular cortex in the pathogenesis of essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
