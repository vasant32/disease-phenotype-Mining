<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE: Silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (SBI) and increased levels of soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) and soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin) are associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether SBI and serum levels of sCD40L and sP-selectin are increased in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> (OSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SBI was studied by brain magnetic resonance images in 50 male patients with OSA and 15 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> male control subjects who were free of comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the effects of 3 months of treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) on serum parameters were studied in 24 patients with moderate to severe OSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The percentage of SBI in patients with moderate to severe OSA (25.0%) was higher than that of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> control subjects (6.7%) or patients with mild OSA (7.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of sCD40L and sP-selectin were significantly higher in patients with moderate to severe OSA than in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> control subjects (p &lt; 0.05) or patients with mild OSA (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, nCPAP significantly decreased serum levels of sCD40L (p &lt; 0.03) and sP-selectin (p &lt; 0.01) in patients with moderate to severe OSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that serum levels of sCD40L and sP-selectin are elevated and SBI is more common in patients with moderate to severe OSA, leading to elevated cerebrovascular morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, nCPAP may be useful for decreasing risk in patients with moderate to severe OSA </plain></SENT>
