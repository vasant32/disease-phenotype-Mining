<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Intracranial arterial dolichoectasia (IADE), also called dilatative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> of the brain, is defined as an increase in length and diameter of intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>Abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> of coronary arteries have been reported in association with IADE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In both conditions, a dysfunction of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2, -3, and -9 have been found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate these MMP pathways in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with IADE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five hundred ten Caucasians patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> were consecutively recruited at 12 centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of IADE was made by consensus between 2 neurologists based on magnetic resonance imaging scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Determination of MMP-2, -3, and -9 plasma levels was centralized in 1 laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because we found a threshold effect of MMP-3 plasma levels with the risk of IADE, determination of the MMP-3 5A/6A polymorphism was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IADE was identified in 12% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no association of IADE with mean MMP-2, -3, and -9 plasma levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After categorization of MMP plasma levels into tertiles, we found a higher risk of IADE with the lowest MMP-3 tertile (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-5.23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In genotype analysis, there was a significant additive effect of the 5A allele on the risk of IADE, with an adjusted OR of 1.62 (95% CI, 1.03-2.55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: In this cohort of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients of Caucasian ancestry, IADE was associated with low MMP-3 plasma levels and with the 5A/6A polymorphism of the promoter region of MMP-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that MMP-3 may play a role in IADE </plain></SENT>
