<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> content was decreased by 26%, but the different classes of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> were not equally affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine levels were decreased by about 40% and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi> by 25%, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17636">sphingomyelin</z:chebi> level remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a 3.2-fold increase in total free fatty acid content with a relatively larger rise in polyunsaturated free fatty acids 20:4 and 22:6 (20-fold increase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Determination of enzyme activities showed decreases in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>,K+-ATPase (-21%) and hexokinase (-14%) but no changes in phosphofructokinase and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> kinase </plain></SENT>
