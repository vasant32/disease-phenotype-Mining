<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> is an important risk factor for brain microbleeds (BMBs) in lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, beyond the qualitative label "<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>," little is known about the association with ambulatory blood pressure (BP) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 123 first-ever lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients we performed 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We counted BMBs on T2*-weighted gradient-echo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because a different etiology for BMBs according to location has been suggested, we distinguished between BMBs in deep and lobar location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BMBs were seen in 36 (29.3%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age, sex, number of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi>, asymptomatic lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and white matter lesions, we found 24-hour, day, and night systolic and diastolic BP levels to be significantly associated with the presence and number of BMBs (odds ratios 1.6 to 2.3 per standard deviation increase in BP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Distinguishing between different locations, various BP characteristics were significantly associated with the presence of deep (or combined deep and lobar) BMBs, but not with purely lobar BMBs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results underline the role of a high 24-hour BP load as an important risk factor for BMBs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The association of BP levels with deep but not purely lobar BMBs is in line with the idea that different vasculopathies might be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Deep BMBs may be a particular marker of BP-related small vessel disease, but longitudinal and larger studies are now warranted to substantiate these findings </plain></SENT>
