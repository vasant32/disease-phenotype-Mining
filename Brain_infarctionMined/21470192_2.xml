<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated (1) clinical and radiological factors related to dynamic cerebral autoregulation (DCA) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and (2) the relationship between DCA and clinical outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 45 patients with middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were analyzed pooling two previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DCA was measured by transcranial Doppler in both <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> early (within 48 h from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) and late (day 5-7) using low-frequency phase and correlation analysis (index Mx) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcome was assessed by modified Rankin scale after a mean period of 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mx increased (i.e. autoregulation worsened) between the early and late measurement, more so on affected (P = 0.005) than on unaffected sides (P = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Poorer autoregulation as indicated by lower ipsilateral phase (early and late) and higher Mx (late measurement) were significantly related to larger infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was significantly related to poorer ipsilateral Mx and phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral phase in the early (P = 0.019) and Mx in the late measurement (P =0..016) were related to poor clinical outcome according to univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Impairment of DCA ipsilateral to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is associated with larger infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Dysautoregulation tends to worsen and spread to the contralateral side over the first days post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and is associated with poor clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
