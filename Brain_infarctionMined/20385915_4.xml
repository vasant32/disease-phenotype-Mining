<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: White matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV), cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and total brain volume (TBV) are associated with cognitive function, but few studies have examined these associations in the general population or whether they differ by race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of WMHV, cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and TBV with global cognition and cognition in 5 separate domains in a biracial population sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A biracial community population of Chicago, Illinois </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional population study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: The study population comprised 575 participants from the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of WMHV, TBV, and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and detailed neuropsychological testing assessments of global cognition and 5 cognitive domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall and among those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, cognition was inversely associated with WMHV and number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> but was positively associated with TBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 measures were simultaneously added to the model, the association of global cognition with WMHV and TBV remained significant and unchanged but was no longer significant with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among subjects without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 MRI measures were associated with performance in multiple cognitive domains, specifically perceptual speed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, among subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, only TBV was associated with cognition and performance in multiple cognitive systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Race did not significantly modify any of these associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this biracial general population sample, the associations of MRI measures with cognition differed according to clinical status of subjects (stronger among subjects without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) and were not modified by race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These associations did not affect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cognitive domains equally but were more consistent with impairments in perceptual speed </plain></SENT>
