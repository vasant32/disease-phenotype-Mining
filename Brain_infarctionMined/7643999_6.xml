<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The t-PA therapy was started 3, 4, or 5 hours after autologous clot embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>New Zealand rabbits were randomized to receive a 2-hour intravenous infusion of either t-PA (6.3 mg/kg) or a saline solution (0.9% saline) after an autologous clot had embolized the anterior cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), intracranial pressure (ICP), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size were measured to determine the effects of the delayed administration of the t-PA after intracranial embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the following physiological parameters were monitored throughout the protocol: mean arterial pressure, hematocrit, arterial blood gases, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and core and brain temperatures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were studied for 4 hours after the administration of the t-PA or control solution; thus, the duration of each experiment was 7, 8, or 9 hours after autologous clot embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In control animals, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and final ICP values were directly related to the length of time studied after clot embolization; among control animals, the largest <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and greatest rise in ICP were seen 9 hours after embolization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
