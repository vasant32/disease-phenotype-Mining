<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> is an important mediator of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, recent evidence suggests that mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> may protect ischemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The HSP70 heat shock protein is induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> in cultured cells and in ischemic brain and protects cells against many types of injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this study determined whether induction of heat shock proteins protects cultured astrocytes against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brief exposure of cultured cortical astrocytes to acid (pH 5.2 for 40 min) or heat shock (45 degrees C for 40 min) markedly induced hsp70 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and HSP70 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HSP70 protein was detected with the C92 monoclonal antibody (Welch and Suhan: J Cell Biol 103:2035, 1986), which has been shown to recognize the protein product of the full-length rat hsp70 cDNA (Longo et al: J Neurosci Res 36:325, 1993) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Heat shock of the cultured cortical astrocytes completely protected the astrocytes from an otherwise lethal heat exposure 24 h later (45 degrees C for 4 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, heat pretreatment sensitized the astrocytes to injury from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> 24 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Acid pretreatment, which markedly induced the HSP70 protein without producing astrocytic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, similarly sensitized the cells to injury from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> 24 h later (60% survival following pH 5.2 for 3 h versus 90% survival in controls; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, heat shock pretreatment protected astrocytes against exposure to acid 48 h later (P &lt; 0.05, 1.5-3 h), whereas acid pretreatment had no effect on astrocyte survival 48 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since heat shock did not protect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> at 24 h when HSP70 induction was maximal but did protect at 48 h when HSP70 was markedly diminished, the protective effect of heat shock at 48 h may be related to stress proteins present at 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that induction of HSP70 and other heat shock proteins by heat shock protects astrocytes against subsequent lethal heat shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, heat shock and acid treatment increase the vulnerability of astrocytes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> 24 h later in spite of the induction of HSP70 heat shock proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The finding that heat shock protected astrocytes against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> 2 days later may suggest that delayed induction of stress proteins partially protects the astrocytes against damage produced by high concentrations of hydrogen ions </plain></SENT>
