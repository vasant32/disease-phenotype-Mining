<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Five to 6 days after a right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, a cell suspension of fetal neocortex was grafted into the infarcted area of adult spontaneously hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three to 17 months later, functional integration of the grafts into the afferent somatosensory pathway was tested using the 2-[<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> method for estimation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Grafted rats (n = 8) and control rats (n = 5) with no <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> were stimulated in the left vibrissal region resulting in an increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization in the left trigeminal sensory nucleus and the right ventroposterior nucleus of the thalamus, whereas the same regions in a group (n = 5) of nonstimulated grafted rats were not activated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> uptake in the right somatosensory cortex of control rats was 96 +/- 5 (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) mumol/100 gm/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neocortical grafts consumed less <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> than cortex in control rats but the vibrissae-stimulated group displayed a 110% higher value than the nonstimulated grafted group (32 +/- 5 vs 15 +/- 2, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that graft <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism is increased following stimulation of the host somatosensory pathway, which demonstrates that transplanted neurons can be functionally integrated with neural circuitries of the host after an ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
