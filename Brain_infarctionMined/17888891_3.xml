<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have shown that 5 days of mild <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> has significant effects on fetal ECoG activity, heart rate and blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now studied if mild prolonged hypoxemia had an adverse effect on the fetal cardiovascular and neural responses to repeated cord occlusion and on the magnitude of neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fetal and maternal catheters were placed at 120 days' gestation and animals allocated at random to receive intratracheal maternal administration of nitrogen (n=8) or compressed air in controls (n=7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five days after surgery, nitrogen infusion was adjusted to reduce fetal brachial artery pO(2) by 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 5 days of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hypoxemia, the umbilical cord was completely occluded for 5 min every 30 min for a total of four occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data are presented as mean+/-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> and were analyzed by two-way ANOVA or two-sample t-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nitrogen infusion decreased fetal pO(2) by 26% (20.5+/-1.7 vs. 14.3+/-0.8 mm Hg) without changing fetal pCO(2) or pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pre-existing <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> fetuses had a greater terminal fall in heart rate in occlusions II, III and IV, and also had a more severe terminal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> in the final occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pre-existing <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> was associated with a greater fall in spectral edge frequency during occlusions from 14.4+/-0.9 Hz to 6.9+/-0.4 Hz vs. 13.6+/-1.64 Hz to 10.6+/-0.77 Hz in controls, p&lt;0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, during the three-day post-occlusion period, the contribution of theta and alpha band frequencies to total ECoG activity was significantly lower in the pre-existing <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> fetuses (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These effects were associated with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> in the striatum (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In summary, the cardiovascular and neural response indicates a detrimental effect of pre-existing mild <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> on fetal outcome following repeated umbilical cord occlusions </plain></SENT>
