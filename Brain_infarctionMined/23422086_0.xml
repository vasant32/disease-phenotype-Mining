<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we asked whether <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> combined with intravenous tPA may ameliorate <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and brain injury after focal embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in type 1 diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Type 1 diabetic rats were subjected to a focal embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three treatment groups were used: (1) saline at 1.5 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; (2) tPA alone at 1.5 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; (3) combined <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> (intravenously) at 1 hour plus tPA at 1.5 hours, and second treatment of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> (intraperitoneally) at 12 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> brain tissue damages were assessed at 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory biomarkers interleukin-1β and matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 were examined in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil infiltration, microglia activation, matrix metalloproteinase activation, and degradation of the tight junction protein claudin-5 were examined in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with saline or tPA alone treatments, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> plus tPA combination therapy significantly reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and hemispheric swelling at 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combination also significantly suppressed the elevated plasma levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and interleukin-1β up to 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 16 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, neutrophil infiltration, microglia activation, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and tight junction protein claudin-5 degradation in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> brain tissues were also significantly attenuated by the combination therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> plus tPA may be beneficial in ameliorating <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infarction, brain</z:e> swelling, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
