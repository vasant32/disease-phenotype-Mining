<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that neuroblasts migrate from the subventricular zone (SVZ) into the injured area after ischemic brain insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is not well understood which mechanism mediates this ectopic migration and which types of cells migrate into the damaged region from the SVZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to investigate the characteristics of the migration of nestin-positive neural stem cells toward the region of ischemic injury after focal cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nestin-eGFP transgenic mice were used to effectively model the migration of SVZ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Photothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced by injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> (30 mg/kg) and exposure to cold light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Migration of nestin-positive cells was examined using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52818">1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49706">perchlorate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52029">DiI</z:chebi>) and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of nestin-positive cells was increased significantly in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area at 5 and 7 days after photothrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A subset of nestin-positive cells was co-labeled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52029">DiI</z:chebi> or BrdU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Some of the nestin-positive cells co-expressed doublecortin (DCX) and only a few nestin-positive cells co-labeled with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr) antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, no nestin-positive cells were immunoreactive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) using the MMP inhibitor, FN-439, decreased nestin-positive cells in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region at 7 days after photothrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although MMP-9 was not co-expressed in the nestin-positive cells in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cortex, MMP-9 did co-localize with GFAP-positive astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that nestin-positive neural progenitor cells migrate into the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cortex after photothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and that MMP-9 is involved in the migration </plain></SENT>
