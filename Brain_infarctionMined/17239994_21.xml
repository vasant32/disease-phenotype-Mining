<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Participants (n=490; 60-90 years) were non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> and 51.0% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, 4.9% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, 17.8% were current smoker and 54.0% were former smoker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We segmented brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-images into GM, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> WM, white matter lesion (WML) and CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were rated visually </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With increasing age, volumes of total brain, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> WM and total WM decreased; that of GM remained unchanged; and that of WML increased, in both men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Excluding persons with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> did not alter these results </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diastolic blood pressure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and current smoking were also related to smaller brain volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the elderly, higher age, small vessel disease and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> are associated with smaller brain volume, especially WM volume </plain></SENT>
