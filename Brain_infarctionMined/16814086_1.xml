<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role of homozygosity for the C677T mutation in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="12071">5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) gene as an independent risk factor for primary and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has been questioned, although recent data appear to be supportive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the association of homozygous C677T MTHFR mutation with silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> in infancy has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors describe an 11-month-old male who had suffered a silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> followed by a symptomatic arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The evaluation revealed mildly elevated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels secondary to homozygous C677T alleles for MTHFR and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An extensive evaluation for other causes of infarction was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the mother's homozygous MTHFR status played a role in the early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> may have contributed to the recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated with anticoagulation therapy, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi>, and iron supplementation and has not had a recurrent event during 3 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This case provides further evidence that homozygous MTHFR mutation is a predisposing factor for early and recurrent pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, including silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, especially in the presence of other risk factors </plain></SENT>
