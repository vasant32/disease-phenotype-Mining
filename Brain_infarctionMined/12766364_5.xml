<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cervical and intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were investigated in comparison with the findings of coronary angiography in 133 consecutive patients with CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean severity scores of cervical and intracranial MRA lesions were significantly higher in the three-vessel CAD (0.40 and 0.53, respectively) than in the zero-vessel CAD group (0.04 and 0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean scores of the maximal size and multiplicity of MRI lesion were also significantly greater in the two-vessel (1.00 and 1.44) and three-vessel CAD (0.94 and 1.26) than in the zero-vessel CAD group (0.27 and 0.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of MRA lesion was markedly higher in patients with brain MRI lesion than in those without (51.1 vs. 6.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Serious coronary artery lesions were commonly accompanied by latent <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> in the cervical and intracranial arteries besides silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in patients with CAD </plain></SENT>
