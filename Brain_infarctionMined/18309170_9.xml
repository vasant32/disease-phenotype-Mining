<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of intracranial plaques and stenoses and their causal role in patients with fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is considered to be a rare condition with a severe prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, disease prevalence may be underestimated due to lack of appropriate diagnostic procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a systematic analysis of intra- and extracranial arteries, the aortic arch, and the heart in 339 consecutive autopsies of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical history, risk factors, imaging data, and general autopsy reports were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (n=80) were used as control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intracranial plaques and stenoses occurred in 62.2% (95% CI, 56.3 to 68.1) and 43.2% (95% CI, 37.2 to 49.3) of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, respectively, compared with 48.8% (P&lt;0.05) and 17.5% (P&lt;0.001) of patients with brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 43% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> with at least one intracranial plaque-inducing <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> stenosis graded &gt;30%, the stenosis was considered to be causal in 5.8% of cases (n=15) because of superimposed clot on ulcerated plaques; 27% of these patients had stenoses graded 30% to 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and male sex were significantly associated with intracranial plaques and stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>History of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> was significantly associated with intracranial plaques and previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was associated with intracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial plaques and stenoses are highly prevalent in fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and stenoses graded 30% to 75% may be causal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>New arterial wall imaging techniques should be used to reevaluate the frequency and role of intracranial artery plaques in living patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
