<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Elevated activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> have been shown to mediate ischemic injury as well as neurovascular remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The extracellular MMP inducer (EMMPRIN) is a 58-kDa cell surface <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>, which has been known to play a key regulatory role for MMP activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The roles of EMMPRIN in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> injury are not clearly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated changes of EMMPRIN in a mouse model of permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and examined potential association between EMMPRIN and MMP-9 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adult male CD-1 mice were subjected to permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> by intraluminal occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCAO) under anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EMMPRIN expression was markedly upregulated in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area at 2-7 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> compared to the contralateral non-ischemic hemisphere by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescent double staining demonstrated that EMMPRIN signals co-localized with vwF-positive endothelial cells and GFAP-positive peri-vascular astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, EMMPRIN signal did not co-localize with NeuN-positive neurons, or MPO-positive neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dual fluorescent staining revealed that EMMPRIN co-localized with MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data also demonstrated that increased EMMPRIN expression correlated with increased MMP-9 levels in a temporal manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, we report for the first time that EMMPRIN expression was significantly increased in a mouse model of permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The spatial and temporal association between increased EMMPRIN expression and elevated MMP-9 levels suggest that EMMPRIN may modulate MMP-9 activity, and participate in neurovascular remodeling after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
