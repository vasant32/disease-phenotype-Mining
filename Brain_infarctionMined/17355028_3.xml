<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They hypothesize that this complication was associated with cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> secondary to intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, which was caused by an unnoticed leak of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the thoracic cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and intrathoracic CSF were confirmed at autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The former disorder is the most severe manifestation of the pathophysiological mechanism occurring to a lesser degree in patients affected by mild intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, and occurs more frequently in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (of an orthostatic nature or not) must be considered in the differential diagnosis of every patient who complains of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> after thoracoscopic or open transthoracic microdiscectomy </plain></SENT>
