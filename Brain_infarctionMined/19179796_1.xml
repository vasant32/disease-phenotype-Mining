<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Epidemiological studies on <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) in Japanese is scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As aging is one of the contributing factors to AF, we investigated the prevalence of AF among aged members of a Japanese community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Samples were community residents who were aged 65 years or older from town I, which is located at the north end of Kyoto Prefecture, Japan, and 39.9% of the population is over age 65 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For a period of 22 months starting in March, 2006, three groups of residents were evaluated: out-patients of the community clinic (the patients group); those who participated in annual residents' check up including ECG (the check-up group) and residents who visited clinics for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> vaccinations (the pulse-examination group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This study screened 550 patients (81.2% of residents more than 65 years old) in the jurisdiction of the town clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 44 residents were diagnosed as having AF, that is 8.0% of residents screened over 65 years old in town </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This resulted in a prevalence of 6.5% among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> residents over 65 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patient's age ranged from 65 to 94 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The male to female ratio was 0.58: 1 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AF was 52.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 42 subjects with AF out of 419 in the patients group, 2 subjects with AF out of 97 in the check-up group, and no subjects with AF in the pulse-examination group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the 42 subjects with AF in the patients group, 88.1% had non-valvular AF and 71.4% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (19%) suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, and ten had non-symptomatic AF (23.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among this group, 37.8% had a CHADS2 score above 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients (54.8%) received anti-coagulation medication and 15 (35.7%) received anti-arrhythmic medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> among elderly patients in a community in Japan was 8.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This group has a high risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>As nearly 24% of patients had non-symptomatic AF, it is important to keep non-symptomatic AF in mind in the treatment of the elderly in order to improve their ADL and QOL </plain></SENT>
