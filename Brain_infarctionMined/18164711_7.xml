<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, a large-scale genetic epidemiological study has shown significant association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the protein kinase C eta (PRKCH) gene with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, particularly, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To extend the findings, we tested association of two SNPs previously reported--rs3783799 and rs2230500--in PRKCH with silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (SLI), which has drawn substantial attention in the aging societies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Disease association was tested in the case-control study design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects with and without SLI were recruited from people who underwent a health-screening examination including brain MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two SNPs were genotyped and proven to be in complete linkage disequilibrium (D'=1.00, r(2)=1.00) and thus showed comparable results of disease association, which were reproduced in two panels collected independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the entire population involving 295 cases and 497 controls, two SNPs remained to be significantly associated with SLI under a dominant model even after adjustment for confounding factors such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (e.g., genetic effects of rs2230500, P=0.0026 for AA+AG vs. GG, adjusted odds ratio=1.27; 95% CI, 1.09-1.48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As the two SNPs appear to be common only in Asian people, further replication study is warranted in the other Asian populations as well as the Japanese </plain></SENT>
