<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There are limited data on the relationship between patient and site characteristics and clinical outcomes after intracranial stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a multivariable analysis that correlated patient and site characteristics with the occurrence of the primary endpoint (any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 30 days of stenting or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the territory of the stented artery beyond 30 days) in 160 patients enrolled in this stenting registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presented with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, or other cerebral ischemic event (e.g., <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar insufficiency</z:e>) in the territory of a suspected 50-99% stenosis of a major intracranial artery while on antithrombotic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cerebral angiography confirmed that 99% (158/160) of patients had a 50-99% stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, the primary endpoint was associated with posterior circulation stenosis (vs anterior circulation) (hazard ratio [HR] 3.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-9.3, p = 0.018), stenting at low enrollment sites (&lt; 10 patients each) (vs high enrollment site) (HR 2.8, 95% CI 1.1-7.6, p = 0.038), &lt; or = 10 days from qualifying event to stenting (vs &gt; or = 10 days) (HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.0-7.8, p = 0.058), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as a qualifying event (vs <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>/other) (HR 3.2, 95% CI 0.9-11.2, p = 0.064) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint based on age, gender, race, or percent stenosis (50-69% vs 70-99%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Major cerebrovascular complications after intracranial stenting may be associated with posterior circulation stenosis, low volume sites, stenting soon after a qualifying event, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as the qualifying event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These factors will need to be monitored in future trials of intracranial stenting </plain></SENT>
