<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the release of cytosolic material from damaged cells, the biochemical and ionic alterations within the core are dramatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, adjacent cells ( <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> rim) are generally exposed to these changes and may be deleteriously affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To mimic such conditions in vitro, we have employed a slice culture system and used an ischemic solution (IS) that resembles the milieu in the territory of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> rim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> artificial cerebral spinal fluid, IS is characterized by low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, pH; excitotoxic levels of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>; and ionic alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, we examined cell injury/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> following exposure to IS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data show significant cell injury starting at approximately 8 h following IS exposure with cell injury spreading as a function of exposure duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We further studied the effect of each component in the IS separately, i.e., <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, ionic shifts or <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> exitotoxicity and were able to isolate the contribution of each of these effectors to the IS-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that in IS, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> exacerbates the potential for injury while ionic shifts, especially those of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>, alleviate the potential for cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
