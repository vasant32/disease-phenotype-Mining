<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort of 95 patients with a first-ever symptomaticlacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, older than 40 years, MMSE&gt;or=15 and no other neurological or major psychiatric deficits were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were assessed (clinically and with a neuropsychological test battery) at 1 and 24 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and CT was repeated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>VMCI was diagnosed when patients had a deficit in at least one cognitive domain, in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Approximately 75% of the patients had VMCI at 1 month; this percentage was somewhat lower at 2 years </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: VMCI is highly prevalent after lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but does not increase during the first 2 years thereafter </plain></SENT>
