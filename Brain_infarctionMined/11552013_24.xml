<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors examined 112 consecutive patients (mean age, 69 years; 60 men) with their first <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A pathologic sympathetic activation was presumed if the initial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> level exceeds 300 pg/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, involvement of the insular cortex, nighttime blood pressure changes, and several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One-year outcome measures were mortality rate, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, and activities of daily living (Barthel index and Rankin score) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">Norepinephrine</z:chebi> levels greater than 300 pg/mL, nighttime blood pressure increases, and insular involvement were associated with a lower Barthel index (p &lt; 0.005) at the 1-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By stepwise logistic regression analysis, insular infarction, serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> concentration, right-sided infarction, and nighttime blood pressure increase were significant and independent predictors of an unfavorable functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analysis showed a higher rate of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (hazard ratio, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.07; 6.83; p &lt; 0.04) in patients with initially increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The involvement of the insular cortex, the occurrence of a pathologic nighttime blood pressure increase, and an initially increased serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> concentration are independent predictors of poor long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
