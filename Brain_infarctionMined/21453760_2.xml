<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This neuroprotection is thought to be mediated through anti-excitotoxic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotective and immune modulatory effects of sigma ligands have not been investigated in embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, rats were subjected to embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or sham <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and were treated with the sigma-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> PRE-084 (5mg/kg i.p.) or saline vehicle 3 and 24h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume and behavioural tests were conducted, and cytokine levels (ILs-1α and β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, GM-CSF and TNF-α) were determined in ischemic and non-ischemic cortices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Axonal damage was determined using the pNF-H ELISA assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with PRE-084 afforded neuroprotection following embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as evidenced by significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improved behavioural outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, treatment with PRE-084 reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhanced anti-inflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Levels of pNF-H were lower in rats treated with PRE-084 suggesting reduced axonal damage but this finding did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings of the present study suggest that part of the neuroprotective effects of sigma-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> may be mediated through a dual effect on cytokine release following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
