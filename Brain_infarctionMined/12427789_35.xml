<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1446293,C0600452" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatopulmonary syndrome</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi>) is defined as the triad of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e>, arterial deoxygenation, and pulmonary vascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reported prevalence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi> in cirrhotic patients varies between 4% and 19%, and various threshold values defining arterial deoxygenation have been used and recommended previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is not known how the prevalence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi> differs using different cut off values for arterial deoxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 127 patients for the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi> using transthoracic contrast echocardiography for detection of pulmonary vasodilation, pulmonary function tests, and blood gas analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety eight patients were included in the study, of whom 33 (34%) had a positive contrast echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using an increased alveolar-arterial difference for the partial pressure of oxygen (AaDO(2)) as an indication of hypoxaemia, the prevalence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi> was considerably higher (&gt;15 mm Hg, 32%; &gt;20 mm Hg, 31%; and &gt;age related threshold, 28%) than using reduced partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO(2)) as a threshold (&lt;80 mm Hg, 19%; &lt;70 mm Hg, 15%; and &lt;age related threshold, 15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For AaDO(2) as the cut off, the positive predictive value for a diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi> was low (34%, 37%, and 53%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, PaO(2) as a cut off had considerably higher positive predictive values (44%, 93%, and 94%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Introducing PaO(2) &lt;65 mm Hg as the cut off, the positive predictive value increased to 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dyspnoea was more often present in patients with "clinically significant" <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi> (57%) compared with "subclinical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi>" (8%), and patients without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi> (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Child-Pugh score correlated significantly with the severity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two of five liver transplanted patients with "subclinical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi>" had embolic brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, possibly induced by venous emboli passing through dilated intrapulmonary vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Defining arterial hypoxaemia in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi> by different, previously used, cut off values for arterial oxygenation leads to a wide variation in the prevalence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi> in the same sample of cirrhotic patients </plain></SENT>
