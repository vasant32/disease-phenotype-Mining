<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Several issues regarding ethnic-cultural factors, sex-related variation, and risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have been described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there have been no prospective studies comparing ethnic differences and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes between populations from South America and North America </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that natives from Buenos Aires, Argentina, may have higher frequency of hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and penetrating artery disease than North American subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to validate this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the database of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients admitted to the Ramos Mejia Hospital (RMH) in Buenos Aires and to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIMC) in Boston, Massachusetts, from July 1997 to March 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> subtypes were classified according to the Trial of Org 10172 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Treatment (TOAST) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> information on patients (demographic, clinical, and radiographic) was recorded prospective to the assessment of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three hundred sixty-one and 479 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were included at RMH and BIMC <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> data banks, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>Coronary artery disease</z:hpo> was significantly more frequent in BIMC (P:&lt;0.001), whereas tobacco and alcohol intake were significantly more frequent in RMH (P:&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>Intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (P:&lt;0.001) and penetrating artery disease (P:&lt;0.001) were significantly more frequent in the RMH registry, whereas large-artery disease (P:&lt;0.02) and cardioembolism (P:&lt;0.001) were more common in the BIMC data bank </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Penetrating artery disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> were the most frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes in natives from Buenos Aires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> were more frequent among Caucasians from Buenos Aires than Caucasians from Boston </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Poor risk factor control and dietary habits could explain these differences </plain></SENT>
