<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the neuroprotective efficacy of a post-treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5862">idazoxan</z:chebi> (Idaz): an alpha2-adrenoceptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> with activity at the I1- and I2-subtypes of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53094">imidazoline</z:chebi> receptor (I-receptor), in an experimental model of perinatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two, 7-day-old Wistar rats were subjected to permanent unilateral ligation of the common carotid artery and transient (2 hr) <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (8% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The surviving animals were sub-divided into 3 groups: one "control" group received intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of saline (Sigma; n = 21) and two "treated" groups received, 10 min post-HI, i.p. treatments with Idaz (I3: 3 mg/kg; n = 19) or (I8: 8 mg/kg; n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Idaz effects were assessed by TTC-staining 72 hr post-HI for Sigma (n = 13), I3 (n = 11), and I8 (n = 12) groups and by MRI-examination 5 weeks post-HI for Sigma (n = 8), I3 (n = 8), and I8 (n = 6) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total ratio of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas were significantly (P &lt; 0.01) different between Sigma and Idaz-treated rats: 20.9 +/- 4.0%, 35.6 +/- 5.9 % and 36.8 +/- 5.8% for Sigma, I3 and I8, respectively, when determined with TTC-staining and; 23.3 +/- 3.7%, 39.8 +/- 4.2%, and 43.2 +/- 10.1%, for Sigma, I3, and I8, respectively, when assessed by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that Idaz, given as a post-HI treatment, does not exert neuroprotective effects but enhances the brain injury induced by focal neonatal cerebral HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The deleterious mechanism may result from an overactivity of sympathetic tone and/or the immaturity of central I-receptors in newborn rats </plain></SENT>
