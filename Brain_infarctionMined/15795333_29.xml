<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD40/CD40L expression is elevated in patients after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of CD40/CD40L signaling in cerebral microvascular dysfunction and tissue injury response to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Intravital fluorescence microscopy was used to visualize the cerebral microcirculation of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT), CD40-deficient, and CD40L-deficient mice subjected to 1-hour MCAO and 4-hour reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of platelets and of leukocytes and vascular permeability were measured in postcapillary venules after 4-hour and 1-hour reperfusions, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was analyzed 24 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Platelet and leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> was elevated and blood/brain barrier function was compromised by MCAO in WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood cell recruitment and increased permeability were blunted in both CD40-deficient and CD40L-deficient mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was also reduced in CD40- and CD40L-deficient mice compared with WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that CD40/CD40L signaling contributes to inflammatory and prothrombogenic responses and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> induced by MCAO and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The CD40/CD40L dyad may play a significant pathogenic role in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
