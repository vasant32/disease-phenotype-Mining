<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> (DAVFs) with disturbed regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) include retrograde leptomeningeal venous drainage (RLVD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined rCBF disturbances in patients with DAVFs by studying <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT (SPECT) changes before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 22 patients with DAVFs and RLVD, we studied their symptoms, pre- and post-treatment <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and SPECT findings, and treatment results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were assigned to two groups: Type 1 included those with RLVD into more than one venous sinus, and type 2, those with RLVD into a single venous sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven patients had type 1 RLVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In these patients, preoperative T2-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images showed no hyperintense areas, and angiographic evidence showed flow into more than one venous sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other 11 patients had type 2 RLVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these patients, preoperative SPECT demonstrated hypoperfused areas that coincided with hyperintense areas on T2-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After treatment, the hyperintense areas disappeared, and symptoms improved in seven of these patients (type 2a) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Their preoperative SPECT studies demonstrated preservation of vasoreactivity after an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the other four patients (Type 2b), the hyperintense areas and symptoms persisted after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Their preoperative SPECT studies revealed a marked disturbance of vasoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with drainage into a single venous sinus, we consistently observed areas of hyperintensity on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results and findings of hypoperfusion on SPECT scans apparently reflect venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath>, whereas unpreserved vasoreactivity after an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge on SPECT scans reflects venous infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The preservation of vasoreactivity after the challenge appears to be a good prognostic indicator </plain></SENT>
