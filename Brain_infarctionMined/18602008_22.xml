<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to elucidate the role of HIF-1alpha in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rice-Vannucci model of neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752304" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoxic-ischemic brain injury</z:e> was used in seven-day-old rats, by subjecting unilateral carotid artery ligation followed by 2 h of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (8% O2 at 37 degrees C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HIF-1alpha activity was inhibited by 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2) and enhanced by dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results showed that 2ME2 exhibited dose-dependent neuroprotection by decreasing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> at 48 h post HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotection was lost when 2ME2 was administered 3 h post HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HIF-1alpha upregulation by DMOG increased the permeability of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> compared with HI group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>2ME2 attenuated the increase in HIF-1alpha and VEGF 24 h after HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>2ME2 also had a long-term effect of protecting against the loss of brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The study showed that the early inhibition of HIF-1alpha acutely after injury provided neuroprotection after neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> which was associated with preservation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> integrity, attenuation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, and neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
