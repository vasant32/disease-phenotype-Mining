<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and thirteen <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-free, community-dwelling adults (ages 54-81 years; 65% men; 91% white) engaged in (1) clinical assessment of resting SBP and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>; (2) MRI rated for periventricular white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and deep WMH silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (SBI) and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (i.e. ventricular enlargement and sulcal widening ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Principal components analysis of the MRI ratings yielded a two-component solution--(1) periventricular and deep WMH SBI; and (2) ventricular enlargement, sulcal widening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Relations of SBP, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> and pulse pressure (PP) (and their interactions with age) to each MRI component were examined in multiple regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and cholesterol, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensives</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For component 1, results indicated significant interactions of SBP and PP with age (P &lt; 0.05); higher levels of SBP and PP were associated with greater white matter disease and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> at younger ages (≤ 68 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant interactions of SBP and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> with age were also noted for component 2 (P &lt; 0.05); higher levels of BP were associated with greater brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> at younger ages (≤ 63 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: : Higher BP and PP are associated with greater subclinical cerebrovascular disease most prominently in the 'young old' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Appropriate management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and arterial stiffening may be critical to the preservation of brain structure with ageing </plain></SENT>
