<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on previous animal studies it was concluded that one key player of the cerebellar part of this gaze-holding neural network is the flocculus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Up to now, in humans there are no systematic studies in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar lesions</z:e> examining one of the most common forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo>: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000640'>gaze-evoked nystagmus</z:hpo> (GEN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of our present study was to clarify which cerebellar structures are involved in the generation of GEN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-one patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> unilateral cerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were analyzed by means of modern MRI-based voxel-wise lesion-behavior mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our data indicate that cerebellar structures such as the vermal pyramid, the uvula, and the tonsil, but also parts of the biventer lobule and the inferior semilunar lobule, were affected in horizontal GEN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It seems that these structures are part of a gaze-holding neural integrator control system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, GEN might present a diagnostic sign pointing toward ipsilesionally located lesions of midline and lower cerebellar structures </plain></SENT>
