<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Because <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> subsequent to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> may play a role in promoting the complications of atherosclerotic disease and may also induce hypercoagulation, we hypothesized that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> vaccination may protect against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> epidemic period we studied 270 subjects, including 90 consecutive patients older than 60 years admitted to the hospital for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and 180 population-based controls, matched for age, sex, and district of residency in Paris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a structured interview on whether they had been vaccinated during the last <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> vaccination campaign or every year during the 5 last years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found significantly fewer vaccinated subjects during the last vaccination campaign among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> than among controls (46.7% versus 59.4%; P=0.036) and fewer patients vaccinated every year during the last 5 years (41.1% versus 56.1%; P=0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, traditional risk factors, and recent use of antibiotics, the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was reduced in the subjects vaccinated during the year of the study and in those vaccinated during the last 5 years, with an odds ratio of 0.50 (95% CI, 0.26 to 0.94; P=0.033) and 0.42 (95% CI, 0.21 to 0.81; P=0.009), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar associations were observed in cases and controls free of previous cardiovascular history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects younger than 75 years and subjects free of risk factors or in high social class were significantly less often vaccinated than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">Influenza</z:e> vaccination may protect against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> by reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> or may identify a subgroup of patients at low risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> because of a better lifestyle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results give rise to a new hypothesis for research into <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention </plain></SENT>
