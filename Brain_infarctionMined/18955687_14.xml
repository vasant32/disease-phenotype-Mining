<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0150088" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Unilateral neglect</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> right hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> significantly impedes poststroke recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied patients with right hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to determine whether increasing age was associated with more frequent or more severe neglect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight neglect tests within 5 days of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (and within 24 hours of admission) were administered to 204 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> right hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Size of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was measured, and neglect tests were scored as percent error. "Any neglect" was defined by an elevated neglect test score, standardized relative to a group of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When tested for neglect soon after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> admission, 69.6% of subjects older than 65 years had "any neglect" (defined by comparison to a group of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls), compared with 49.4% of subjects aged 65 years and younger (p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For every additional 10 years of age, patients were 1.83 times as likely to have neglect, even after adjusting for diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score (95% CI 1.38-2.43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, DWI volume and NIHSS independently predicted neglect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Score on virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the neglect tests worsened as an effect of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Percentage error on a line cancellation task was 3.8% higher for every additional 10 years of age, after adjustment for DWI volume and NIHSS (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similar results were found for other neglect tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increasing age in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> right hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> significantly increases the odds of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0150088" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">unilateral neglect</z:e> as well as severity of neglect, independently of size of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The reason for this finding in older patients may be because they have more brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and may be less able to compensate for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, or because they tend to have more cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, which may be more cortically based </plain></SENT>
