<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Legg-Calv√©-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Perthes disease</z:e> (LCPD) is a juvenile form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>osteonecrosis</z:hpo> of the femoral head that can produce permanent femoral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854297" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">head deformity</z:e> (FHD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003088'>premature osteoarthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The development of FHD in LCPD is closely associated with the repair process, characterized by a predominance of bone resorption in its early stage that produces a fragmented appearance and collapse of the femoral head </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We present here a novel strategy to preserve the femoral head structure after ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>osteonecrosis</z:hpo> based on inhibition of interaction between RANK and RANKL using exogenous administration of osteoprotegerin (OPG-Fc) in a large animal model of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>osteonecrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>osteonecrosis</z:hpo> was surgically induced in 18 male piglets by placing a ligature tightly around the right femoral neck to disrupt the blood flow to the right femoral head </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two weeks after the induction of total head infarction, OPG-Fc or saline was administered subcutaneously to nine animals per group for 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The contralateral, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (left) femoral heads from the animals treated with saline served as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, nondisease controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were killed at 8 weeks when severe FHD has been previously shown to occur because of the repair process dominated by osteoclastic bone resorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Radiographic, histomorphometric, and immunohistochemical assessments were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Radiographic assessment showed significantly better preservation of the femoral head structure in the OPG-Fc group compared with the saline group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Epiphyseal quotient (the ratio of epiphyseal height to diameter) was significantly higher in the OPG-Fc group (0.41 +/- 0.09) compared with the saline group (0.24 +/- 0.08, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Histomorphometric assessment revealed a significant reduction in the number of osteoclasts present in the OPG-Fc group (5.9 +/- 5.3mm(-2)) compared with the saline group (39.6 +/- 13.8 mm(-2), p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Trabecular bone volume, number, and separation were significantly better preserved in the OPG-Fc group compared with the saline group (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in femoral length was observed between the OPG-Fc and saline groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining revealed the presence of OPG-Fc only within the blood vessels, with no apparent staining of bone matrix or trabecular bone surfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that RANKL inhibition decreases bone resorption and FHD after ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>osteonecrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Because RANKL inhibitors do not bind to bone, their effects on resorption are reversible as the drug is cleared from circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The reversible nature of RANKL inhibitors is very appealing for treating pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005940" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bone diseases</z:e> such as LCPD, where the resorptive stage of the disease lasts for 1-2 years </plain></SENT>
