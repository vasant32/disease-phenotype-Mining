<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> pontine infarction without basilar artery (BA) occlusion were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified into two groups (D, group with neurological deterioration; ND, group without neurological deterioration) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After magnetic resonance angiography was performed to identify the diameters of internal carotid artery (ICA) and BA, the BA diameter/ICA diameter (BA/ICA) ratio was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the ischemic lesion on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging extended to the ventral basal pial surface, it was diagnosed as branch atheromatous disease (BAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neurological deterioration occurred in 16 (31%) of 51 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BAD was found in 13 (81%) of 16 patients of the D group and 14 (40%) of 35 in the ND group (p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The BA/ICA ratio was 0.73 (0.59-0.84) in the D group and 0.64 (0.55-0.71) in the ND group (p = 0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that BAD (OR 15.62, 95% CI 2.37-103.13, p = 0.004) and a BA/ICA ratio of &gt;or=0.70 (OR 7.76, 95% CI 1.55-38.88, p = 0.013) were independent factors associated with neurological deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The BA diameter may be associated with neurological deterioration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> pontine infarction </plain></SENT>
