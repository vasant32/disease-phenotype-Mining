<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Eleven adults spontaneously-hypertensive male rats (SHR) were studied 22 h or 7 days after a 2 h unilateral occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Another 11 SHR were studied after 24 h or 7 days of permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were significantly larger (P &lt; 0.05) after permanent occlusion than after a 2 h occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More extensive and widespread vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, emanating from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, was visualized immunohistochemically in the temporarily-ligated animals and the relative number of astrocytes in their contralateral hemispheres was greater, thereby indicating that the vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> influences the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An immunopositivity for albumin but not for fibrinogen extended via the white matter into the ipsilateral thalamic nuclei, where cytolytic nerve cell damage, severely shrunken and karyorrhectic nerve cells as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> were found one week after permanent and temporary <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The histological changes in the thalamus indicated a difference in timing between lateral and medial parts of the lesion as well as between temporarily- and permanently-ligated SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings together with the close spatial correlation with albumin immunoreactivity indicate that the spread of extravasated plasma constituents or degradation products with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> bulk flow from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> influences the timing, character and extent of thalamic lesions after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
