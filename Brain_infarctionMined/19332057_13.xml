<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine whether intranasal administration (iN) of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-1 (rhIGF-1) provides neuroprotection to the neonatal rat brain following cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (HI), two doses of rhIGF-1 (50 microg at a 1 h interval) were infused into the right naris of postnatal day 7 (P7) rat pups with or without a prior HI insult (right common carotid artery ligation, followed by an exposure to 8% oxygen for 2 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our result showed that rhIGF-1 administered via iN was successfully delivered into the brain 30 min after the second dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the following studies rhIGF-1 was administered to P7 rat pups at 0, 1 or 2 h after HI at the dose described above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pups in the control group received cerebral HI and vehicle treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pups that underwent sham operation and vehicle treatment served as the sham group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain pathological changes were evaluated 2 and 15 days after HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that rhIGF-1 treatment up to 1 h after cerebral HI effectively reduced brain injury as compared to that in the vehicle-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, rhIGF-1 treatment improved neurobehavioral performance (tested on P5-P21) in juvenile rats subjected to HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results further showed that rhIGF-1 inhibited apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, possibly through activating the Akt signal transduction pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>rhIGF-1 enhanced proliferation of neuronal and oligodendroglial progenitors after cerebral HI as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that iN administration of IGF-1 has the potential to be used for clinical treatment </plain></SENT>
