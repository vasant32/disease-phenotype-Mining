<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether minimal expression levels of COX-2 induced by preconditioning trigger HO-1, thereby inducing the synthesis of cytoprotective proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show that both COX-2 and HO-1 are induced in rat brains subjected to preconditioning by middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion for 10 min followed by different amounts of reperfusion time (1-24 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although preconditioning significantly reduced the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size against severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (24 h <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion), pretreatment with the COX-2-selective inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8887">rofecoxib</z:chebi> increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and abolished PCIT-induced COX-2 and HO-1 expression in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) increased the phosphorylation of Akt, which was significantly inhibited by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50914">PI3 kinase inhibitor</z:chebi> LY294002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Taken together, we conclude that the kinetic changes in COX-2 induction during the reperfusion period following preconditioning may be important for ischemic tolerance </plain></SENT>
