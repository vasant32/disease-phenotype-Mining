<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the reactions of organism to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is the increased release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> hormones, included in regulation of effects of numerous mediators/modulators that could be released in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Considering that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> induced systemic response of organism to stress, we presumed that it reflected the contents of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of the disease, and that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> influenced damaging processes of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation in <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> initiated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of our investigation was to define temporal dynamics and manner correlation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> concentration and index of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation (ILP) in the CSF patients in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this investigation we followed changes of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> concentration and ILP in the CSF of 53 patients in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control group included 14 age and sex matched patients, subjected to diagnostic lumbar radiculography because of the sudden motor deficiency <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, without disturbances in the CSF passage and without pain and the consequences of anti-pain and anti-inflammatory therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From the perspective of the duration of period after an ischemic episode patients were divided into four groups: group A: 0-6 hours (n = 12), group B: 7-12 hours (n = 14), group C: 13-24 hours (n = 14), and group D: 24-48 hours of postischemic period (n = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concentration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> in the CSF was measured by quantitative RIA method (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">Cortisol</z:chebi> Bridge kit, Biodata) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ILP was determined according to the spectrophotometric method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Concentration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> in the CSF of patients with completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was of amount 69 +/- 6.7 pmol/ml CSF and was significantly increased (p &lt; 0.001) compared to the values of the control group (2.49 +/- 0.29 pmol/ml CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From 0 to 6 hours after the ischemic insults concentration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> in the CSF the amount was 15.9 +/- 2.4 pmol/ml CSF (p &lt; 0.001), then was progressively increasing and was maximal from 13 to 24 hours after insults (123.2 +/- 7.1 pmol/ml CSF), (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients with completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> ILP in the CSF was twice increased in the course of 48 hours compared to controls (0.54 +/- 0.08 nmolMDA/ml CSF), (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>By comparing the observed parameters we found significant negative correlation between this two indicators in period from 7 to 24 hours (r = -0.77), (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The main potentially protective effect of the increased CSF <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> concentration in patients with completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase could be the decrease of deleterious effects of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation reactions induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This mechanism could be the attempt of organism to compensate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-disturbed homeostasis </plain></SENT>
