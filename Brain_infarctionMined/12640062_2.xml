<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To examine a very large dataset to provide a robust answer to the question of whether visible infarction on computed tomography was (a) an independent predictor of functional outcome at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> times up to 48 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and (b) independently associated with haemorrhagic transformation, with or without antithrombotic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study assessed associations between visible infarction, time to randomisation, baseline neurological deficit, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> syndrome, allocated aspirin or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> treatment, recurrent haemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and six month functional outcome in the International <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 12 550 patients, 6267 (50%) had visible infarction up to 48 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of visible infarction increased with increasing time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and extent of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Visible infarction was independently associated with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 14 days (odds ratio (OR) 1.17, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.35), and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or dependency at six months (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.55), an absolute increase of 13%, or 130 per 1000 more dead or dependent patients with visible infarction than without it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant independent relation between visible infarction and fatal or non-fatal haemorrhagic transformation, or interaction between visible infarction and aspirin or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> treatment allocation with six month functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Visible infarction on computed tomography up to 48 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is an independent adverse prognostic sign </plain></SENT>
