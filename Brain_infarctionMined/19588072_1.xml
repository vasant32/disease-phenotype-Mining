<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These two events may result from a functional stenosis (due to perioperative brainstem sag) of the junction between the vein of Galen and the straight sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Remote <z:hpo ids='HP_0011695'>cerebellar hemorrhage</z:hpo> could then be explained by infarction in the territory of cerebellar veins emptying in the vein of Galen, and the left perisylvian infarction could be caused by venous infarction in the territory of a dominant superficial sylvian vein emptying in the basal vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis could shed light on the pathophysiology of remote <z:hpo ids='HP_0011695'>cerebellar hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
