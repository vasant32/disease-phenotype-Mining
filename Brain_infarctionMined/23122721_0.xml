<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Rapid deterioration of cardiovascular risk control, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, has occurred in Okinawa; this may affect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> incidence, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cross-sectional field studies were conducted in 2 periods, 1988-1991 as the first period, and 2002-2005 as the second period, in the isolated island of Okinawa, Miyakojima </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate population backgrounds related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, data from the health checkup programs conducted in 1987 and 2001 were surveyed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total of 257 patients in the first period and 370 in the second were diagnosed with first-time <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The age-adjusted annual incidence rate of first-time <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of the first and second periods was 124 and 144 per 100,000 standard population of Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The age-adjusted annual incidence rate showed an upward trend for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (50 to 73) and downward trend for brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (61 to 54); however, those trends were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The health checkup surveys illustrated that blood pressure decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups during the second survey period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the body mass index increased in patients aged 50 years or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels of patients aged 30-79 years and non-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels of patients aged 50-79 years significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In Miyakojima, the incidence of first-time <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of its subtypes did not change significantly between two periods, even though blood pressure decreased significantly in the second period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Metabolic deterioration may be associated with the upward trend in incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
