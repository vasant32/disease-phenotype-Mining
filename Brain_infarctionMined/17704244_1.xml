<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: The amino acid cis-4-(18)F-fluoro-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16313">D-proline</z:chebi> (D-cis-(18)F-FPro) exhibits preferential uptake in the brain compared with its L-isomer, but the clinical potential of the tracer is as yet unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we explored the cerebral uptake of D-cis-(18)F-FPro in rats with focal cortical infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focal cortical infarctions were induced in different areas of the cortex of 20 Fisher CDF rats by photothrombosis (PT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At variable time points after PT (1 d to 4 wk), the rats were injected intravenously with D-cis-(18)F-FPro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For comparison, 12 rats were injected simultaneously with (3)H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> ((3)H-DG), 3 rats were injected with (3)H-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16643">L-methionine</z:chebi> ((3)H-MET), and 2 rats were injected with (3)H-PK11195 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within 2 h after injection of the tracers, coronal cryosections of the brains were produced and evaluated by dual-tracer autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lesion-to-brain ratios (L/B ratios) were calculated by dividing the maximal uptake in areas with increased tracer uptake by the mean uptake in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histologic slices were stained by toluidine blue and by immunostainings for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), CD68 for macrophages, and CD11b for microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prominent uptake of D-cis-(18)F-FPro was found in ipsilateral thalamic nuclei (TN) and partially in the corpus striatum starting at 3 d after infarction with increasing L/B ratios up to 4 wk (mean L/B ratio +/- SD, 6.7 +/- 3.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The involved TN varied with the site of the cortical lesion corresponding to their thalamocortical projections connecting them with their specific target region in the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The TN were positive for CD11b and GFAP from day 7 onward, whereas uptake of (3)H-DG, (3)H-MET, and (3)H-PK11195 and immunostaining for CD68 were similar to that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, increased uptake of D-cis-(18)F-FPro was found in the area of the cortical infarctions (mean L/B ratio +/- SD, 12.1 +/- 8.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>From day 5 onward, the pattern of uptake was congruent with that of immunostaining for CD11b and CD68 but was different from that of GFAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: D-cis-(18)F-FPro appears to be a sensitive PET tracer for detection of secondary degeneration of TN after cortical injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The uptake mechanisms of D-cis-(18)F-FPro remain to be elucidated, but the relationship to microglial activation suggests a diagnostic potential in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
