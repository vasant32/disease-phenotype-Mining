<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: A causative association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) has been suggested based on clinical and epidemiological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hypothesis is that the link between DM and AD is related to the function of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), an enzyme that degrades not only insulin and pancreatic amylin but also beta-amyloid (Abeta) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, in diabetics, insulin and Abeta might compete for IDE and this might lead to an increase in Abeta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e> can elevate Abeta levels and thus contribute to AD pathology in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Neuropathological examination was carried out employing conventional and immunohistochemical (IHC) methods of the brains obtained post mortem from 701 aged subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The loads of IHC/Abeta, silver stained <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>neuritic plaques</z:hpo> (NP) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo> (NFT) were significantly higher in subjects carrying the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">Apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E e4 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the loads of Abeta, NPs and NFT in the brains were not influenced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> when comparing 134 diabetic with 567 non-diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the hypothesis that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e> would significantly elevate the Abeta load and thus increase the extent of AD pathology cannot be supported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our result challenges the claim that DM is a direct risk factor of developing AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus further studies on pathological lesions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> diabetics should be conducted </plain></SENT>
