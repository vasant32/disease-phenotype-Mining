<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our research is to determine if paeonol can protect cultured rat hippocampal neurons from oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation(OGD)-induced injury and elucidate the underlying mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We cultivated the rat hippocampal neurons as the object of study and then established the model of oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuronal viability was measured by the reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="25" ids="15858">bromide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>), while intracellular Ca(2+) concentration was observed by fluorospectrophotometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The binding force of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) receptor was evaluated by liquid scintillation counting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation group, paeonol treatment obviously increased cell survival rate and reduced the activity of the binding force of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptors, reversing the overload of intracellular Ca(2+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that paeonol protected rat neurons from oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation-induced injury, resulting in alleviating the morphological damage and increasing neuron viability and suggest that paeonol may exhibit its protective effect against oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation-induced injury by targeting on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptors </plain></SENT>
