<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No significant differences regarding age, size of infarction or extent and frequency of damage to the insular cortex could be detected between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with right-sided infarction showed a significantly reduced circadian blood pressure variability [diastolic: -1% (95% CI -4 to 1) vs -6% (-9 to -2); P &lt; 0.05] and a higher frequency of nocturnal blood pressure increase (47% vs 35%; P &lt; 0.05) as compared with patients with left-sided infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Right-sided infarction was also associated with higher serum <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> concentrations [546 pg/ml (95% CI 415-677) vs 405 pg/ml (266-544); P &lt; 0.05], and ECG more frequently showed QT prolongation (53% vs 35%; P &lt; 0.05) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> (67% vs 20%; P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, irrespective of the hemisphere damaged, patients with insular infarction showed the most pronounced changes of these parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, two patients with right-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (13%) involving the insula, but none with a left-sided infarction, developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest lateralization of sympathetic activation with right-sided dominance for sympathetic effects following hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
