<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous reports have focused on traditional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>; less information has been available on the role of overweight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Baseline data from 4780 Framingham Offspring Study adults with up to 24 years of follow-up were used to assess risk for a first CHD event (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, or cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) alone, first CeVD event (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) alone, and CHD and CeVD events combined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Accelerated failure time models were developed for the time of first event to age, sex, cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM), systolic blood pressure, smoking status, and body mass index (BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Likelihood-ratio tests of statistical significance were used to identify the best-fitting predictive functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age, sex, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, ratio of cholesterol to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, and presence of DM were highly related (P&lt;0.01 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) to the development of first CHD events, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the above except sex and DM were highly related to the first CeVD event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BMI also significantly predicted the occurrence of CHD (P=0.05) and CeVD (P=0.03) in multivariable models adjusting for traditional risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of the BMI effect was reduced but remained statistically significant when traditional variables were included in the prediction models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Greater BMI, higher systolic blood pressure, higher ratio of cholesterol to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, and presence of DM were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> predictive of first CHD events, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but the presence of DM were predictive of first CeVD events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that common pathophysiological mechanisms underlie the roles of BMI, DM, and systolic blood pressure as predictors for first CHD and CeVD events </plain></SENT>
