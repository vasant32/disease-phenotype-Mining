<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 40 consecutive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy have been included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them had preoperative cranial CT, pre and postoperative basal and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cranial CT imaging after digitalization and computer processing were obtained with 4 densitometric patterns: 1). <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebral blood perfusion; 2). ischemic or low brain blood perfusion (patron I); 3). parenchyma without cerebral hemodynamic reserve (patron nR), and 4). <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 32 out of 40 (80 %) patients had abnormal densitometric patterns: 19 nR patterns (47.5 %), 11 I pattern (27.5 %) and 2 established <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The correlation between densitometric cranial TC imaging and SPECT was 92% when analyzing areas with hypoperfusion (S: 96.5 %; E: 82 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cranial CT detected 12/13 of patients who lacked cerebral hemodynamic reserve in the SPECT analysis (S: 74 %; E: 92 %; Vpp: 95 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a good correlation between analysis of densitometric cranial TC imaging and SPECT in determining low cerebral blood flow areas and lack of cerebral hemodynamic reserve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This method could help to improve carotid surgery indications in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
