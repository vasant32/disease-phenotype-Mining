<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is increasingly used both in research and in clinical medicine, and scanner hardware and MRI sequences are continually being improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These advances are likely to result in the detection of unexpected, asymptomatic brain abnormalities, such as <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and subclinical vascular pathologic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a study to determine the prevalence of such incidental brain findings in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects were 2000 persons (mean age, 63.3 years; range, 45.7 to 96.7) from the population-based Rotterdam Study in whom high-resolution, structural brain MRI (1.5 T) was performed according to a standardized protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two trained reviewers recorded <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> brain abnormalities, including asymptomatic brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The volume of white-matter lesions was quantified in milliliters with the use of automated postprocessing techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two experienced neuroradiologists reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> incidental findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> diagnoses were based on MRI findings, and additional histologic confirmation was not obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Asymptomatic brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were present in 145 persons (7.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among findings other than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> (1.8%) and benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> (1.6%), mainly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo>, were the most frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of asymptomatic brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo> increased with age, as did the volume of white-matter lesions, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> showed no age-related increase in prevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Incidental brain findings on MRI, including subclinical vascular pathologic changes, are common in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The most frequent are brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> and benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Information on the natural course of these lesions is needed to inform clinical management </plain></SENT>
