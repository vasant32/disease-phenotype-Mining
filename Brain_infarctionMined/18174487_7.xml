<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The study aim was to assess the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> (MgSO(4)) administration on white matter damage in vivo in spontaneously hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The left internal capsule was lesioned by a local injection of endothelin-1 (ET-1; 200 pmol) in adult spontaneously hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MgSO(4) was administered (300 mg/kg SC) 30 minutes before injection of ET-1, plus 200 mg/kg every hour thereafter for 4 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size was measured by T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (day 2) and histology (day 11), and functional recovery was assessed on days 3 and 10 by the cylinder and walking-ladder tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ET-1 application induced a small, localized lesion within the internal capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite reducing blood pressure, MgSO(4) did not significantly influence <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (by magnetic resonance imaging: median, 2.1 mm(3); interquartile range, 1.3 to 3.8, vs 1.6 mm(3) and 1.2 to 2.1, for the vehicle-treated group; by histology: 0.3 mm(3) and 0.2 to 0.9 vs 0.3 mm(3) and 0.2 to 0.5, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant forelimb and hindlimb motor deficits were evident in the vehicle-treated group as late as day 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These impairments were significantly ameliorated by MgSO(4) in both cylinder (left forelimb use, P&lt;0.01 and both-forelimb use, P&lt;0.03 vs vehicle) and walking-ladder (right hindlimb score, P&lt;0.02 vs vehicle) tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ET-1-induced internal capsule <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in spontaneously hypertensive rats represents a good model of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> with small lesion size, minimal adverse effects, and a measurable motor deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite inducing mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, MgSO(4) did not significantly influence <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size but reduced motor deficits, supporting its potential utility for the treatment of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
