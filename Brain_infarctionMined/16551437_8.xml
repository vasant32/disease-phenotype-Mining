<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether exercise-induced neuroprotection is associated with improved brain integrity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (3 months old, n=38) exercised on a treadmill, which required repetitive locomotor movement, for 30 minutes each day for 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, using an intraluminal filament, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was induced by either 2 hours middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion followed by 24 or 48 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain damage was determined by evaluating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, as well as ultrastructural alteration in endothelial-matrix-astrocyte interfaces.Pre-ischemic motor exercise significantly (p&lt;0.01) reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the frontoparietal cortex and the dorsolateral striatum by 79% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By comparing the percentage difference in brain volume between the right (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> site) and left hemispheres, we demonstrated a significant (p&lt;0.01) reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> associated with reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in a 3 week exercise group (Group 1, n=10) and a 3 week exercise plus 3 week rest group (Group 2, n=10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>Edema</z:hpo> in cortex and striatum was 19 +/- 4% without exercise pre-conditioning (n=10), in contrast to 5 +/- 3% (Group 1) or 6 +/- 4% (Group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The thickness of the basal lamina was enhanced by exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In ischemic rats without pre-exercise, alterations in microvessel ultrastructure with decreased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> area, parenchymal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and swollen astrocyte end-feet, as well as an abnormally thin basal lamina were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, exercise pre-conditioning significantly reduced the ischemic alterations, decreasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and increasing basal lamina thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that exercise pre-conditioning reduces brain injury by decreasing cerebral permeability and enhancing brain integrity after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This exercise-induced endogenous neuroprotection could be an effective strategy to ameliorate ischemic brain injury from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
