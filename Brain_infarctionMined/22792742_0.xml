<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify the mechanism of the development of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection, the data of neuroimaging (localization of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>) and angiography have been analyzed in 49 patients (19 females 30 males, mean age 35,6 +/- 11,3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four variants of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> localization have been distinguished: 1 - the whole ICA territory (middle and anterior cerebral arteries - <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, ACA) - 10%, 2 - the territory of superficial and deep branches of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>- 37%, 3- the territory of superficial <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branches and cortical-medullar arteries - 31% (the cortex and underlying white matter - 19%, the periventricular white matter and semiovale center - 6%, combined localization - 6%); 4 - the territory of deep (perforating) <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branches (the basal ganglia and adjacent white matter) - 22% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In most of patients (92%) the dissection resulted in the occlusion or severe stenosis of intracranial ICA which in a half of cases extended to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and/or ACA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 72% patients dissection involved the extracranial ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The marked obstructive process in the dissected ICA allows to assume that the hemodynamic, but not embolic, mechanism plays a key role in the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is in line with the frequent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> localization in the end or border zones (superficial and deep) of brain blood supply (31%) and the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during a sleep (49%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Arterio-arterial embolism as a mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> development was found in 8% of patients with the isolated extracranial ICA dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It caused stenosis of the lumenand in 6% accompanied by the pseudoaneurism formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Thrombi</z:e> formed inside the aneurism could be the origin of the embolism </plain></SENT>
