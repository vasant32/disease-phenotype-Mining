<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighteen brains with severe SCAA (SCAA) were compared with 21 brains with mild CAA (MCAA) to investigate whether the presence of SCAA in the brains of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients was associated with a higher burden of old microinfarcts than those with MCAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry for CD68 was employed to highlight old microinfarcts in tissue blocks from various brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Old microinfarcts, manually counted by light microscopy, were present in 14 of 18 SCAA brains and in 7 of 21 MCAA brains (P = 0.01, two-tailed Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average number of old microinfarcts across geographic regions in each brain ranged from 0 to 1.95 (mean rank 24.94, sum of ranks 449) in the SCAA group, and from 0 to 0.35 (mean rank 15.76, sum of ranks 331) in the MCAA group (P = 0.008, two-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test) </plain></SENT>
