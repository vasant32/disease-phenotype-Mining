<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective, single-center study was conducted in patients with AF and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> IS with 6-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We included 178 patients: 70 (39%) with pxAF and 108 (61%) with ptAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients with ptAF, patients with pxAF more often presented with subcortical, mainly lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (21% vs 8%, P = 0.01) and were less frequently dependent at discharge (16% vs 42%, P &lt; 0.001) and after 6 months (16% vs 20%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Strokes</z:hpo> in patients with pxAF were more frequently categorized as non-cardioembolic (35% vs 18%, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, after adjustment for confounding factors (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and lack of prestroke anticoagulation), ptAF was an important risk factor for unfavorable short-term (OR 5.4; P &lt; 0.01) and long-term outcomes (OR 2.6, P = 0.01) of IS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with AF, the occurrence of non-cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was related to a reduced risk of dependence or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in short-term outcome (OR 0.4, P = 0.04) and marginally influenced long-term outcome (OR 0.49, P = 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that, compared with patients with ptAF, ISs in patients with pxAF have better outcomes </plain></SENT>
