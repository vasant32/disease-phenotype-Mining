<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the optimal timing for surgery and patient most likely to benefit from this procedures was not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine possible factors predictive of outcome following decompressive craniectomy for ischemic infarction from review of oneurological outcome in our patients at six months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 21 patients who underwent decompressive craniectomy for hemispheric infarction over a three year period in a regional neurosurgical center in Hong Kong </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were recruited subsequently for active in-patient rehabilitation, when suitable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: The median age was 53 and the male to female ration was 1:3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients (19%) achieved independent activity of daily living at six months after rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither early surgery, within 24-48 hours after admission, nor side of infarction correlated with six month neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four patients with favourable neurological outcome at six month demonstrated favourable clinical improvement even at one month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early decompressive hemicraniectomy is not predictive of neurological outcome, determined by Glasgow outcome score, at six months (P = 1.00, NS) </plain></SENT>
