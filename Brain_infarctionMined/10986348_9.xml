<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A prolonged period (48 h) of cortical spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (CSD) induced resistance against severe focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> tolerance), however, the mechanism behind this is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> tolerance was a transient phenomenon; the resistance increased linearly for the initial 12 days, peaking from 12 to 15 days after a preconditioning of CSD, and was decreased thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the time course of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), heat shock protein (hsp)27 and 70, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expressions after CSD in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical expression of BDNF, hsp27, hsp70, or GFAP following a prolonged period of CSD induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>-infusion, or following <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>-infusion was analyzed by regional densitometry for 24 days in the rat neocortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, BDNF protein was measured quantitatively by two-site ELISA assay in the neocortex (n=6 at each time point) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The GFAP expression was elevated in astrocytes (compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level of immunodensity) during the period peaking on day 3-6 following the CSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The hsp27 immunoreactivity was also elevated in astrocytes from day 1 to 12 peaking on day 1 and 6, but there was no expression of hsp70 during the period following CSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The immunoreactivity for BDNF was elevated in neurons from day 0 to 18 peaking on day 1 and 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The protein levels of BDNF in the neocortex were significantly elevated from day 0 to 12 peaking on days 0 and 6 (compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level) (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using a laser-scanning confocal imaging system, the BDNF-like immunoreactivity in neuronal nuclei was found to increase linearly peaking on day 12, which correlated well with the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The intranuclear increase in BDNF-like protein might contribute to the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> tolerance in the brain </plain></SENT>
