<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of hippocampal lesions such as hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> have not been studied in detail even though hippocampal alterations are known to be associated with various clinical conditions such as age-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1285162" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">degenerative disorders</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods: Here we defined the hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and assessed the prevalence of this lesion in large unselected population of 1,245 subjects age ranging from 1 to 99 years (mean age 79 Â± 1 S.E.M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we assessed the association of these lesions with various cardio- and cerebro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disorders</z:e> and other neurodegenerative lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the study population of 1,245 subjects was 12%, increasing to 13% when only those with a clinically diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (n = 311) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Large hemispheric brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were seen in 31% of the study subjects and these lesions were strongly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (43%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> (32%), myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (22%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (20%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> displayed a significant association only with large hemispheric brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, and cardiovascular index as assessed postmortem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is noteworthy that only widespread hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were associated with clinical symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The surprisingly low prevalence of 12% of hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in aged population found here and the failure to detect an association between this lesion and various cerebro- cardio-vascular lesions is intriguing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whether susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in line with susceptibility to <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> in this region is influenced by still undetermined risk- factors need further investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore it should be noted that the size of the hippocampal tissue damage, i.e., small vs. large cystic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> is of significance regarding clinical alterations </plain></SENT>
