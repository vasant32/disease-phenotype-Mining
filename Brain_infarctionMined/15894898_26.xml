<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the relationship between admission blood pressure (BP) and early prognosis in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in a single cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The subjects comprised 1004 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and 1097 cases of brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, who were admitted to hospitals on the day of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> within 30 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was evaluated in relation to admission BP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, a U-shaped relationship was found between BP levels and mortality rate, with a nadir at systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 150-169 mmHg and at diastolic blood pressure (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) of 100-110 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After adjustments for age and sex, the highest relative risks (RR) was observed in the lowest BP levels compared with nadir groups, and were 2.69 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.43-5.07] in SBP and 3.49 (95% CI, 1.58-7.74) in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In subjects with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, the relationship between prognosis and SBP level shifted significantly toward higher pressure by about 10 mmHg compared with those without previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In subjects with brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, the relationship between BP levels and mortality rate showed a J-shape in SBP and a U-shape in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Highest BP levels had the poorest prognoses (&gt;/= 230 mmHg in SBP, RR = 4.13, 95% CI = 2.45-6.94; &gt;/= 120 mmHg in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>, RR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.11-3.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Lower and higher BP after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and higher BP after brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> were predictors for poor early prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, patients with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> had better outcomes at higher admission BP level than did normotensive patients </plain></SENT>
