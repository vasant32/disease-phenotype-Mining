<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cerebral venous outflow consists of the superficial system and the deep draining system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The deep one drains the areas of the great vein of Galen, the two basal veins of Rosenthal, and their tributaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous obstruction of these veins can effect great harm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the case of obstruction of the vein of Galen, the basal vein can ensure the venous outflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, attention should be paid to anastomoses between the basal vein and the infratentorial venous system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lateral mesencephalic vein (LMV) is the most important anastomosis between the supra- and infratentorial system linking the basal vein to the superior petrosal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since microanatomical studies concerning this vein have received less attention the aim of the present study was to visualize the course of this vein, its junction with the basal vein, its tributaries and its relationship with neural structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two cadaveric hemispheres were examined under the operating microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The LMV could be identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, with a mean diameter of 1.07 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thorough understanding of the microanatomy of the LMV is crucial to avoid brain damage due to venous infarction during surgery, and its preservation could ensure deep venous outflow in the case of obstruction of the vein of Galen </plain></SENT>
