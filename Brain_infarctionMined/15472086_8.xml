<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based perfusion measures using dynamic susceptibility contrast are extremely useful for identification of ischemic penumbral tissue in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, errors in the measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) can occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether bolus delay-corrected (BDC) perfusion measures enable better delineation of the ischemic penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) and perfusion-weighted MRI data were acquired from 19 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Perfusion abnormalities were manually defined on BDC perfusion maps (corrected <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> [cMTT] and corrected CBF [cCBF]), and on maps derived from an arterial input function placed within the contralateral (CBF, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) and ipsilateral (ipsilateral CBF [iCBF] and ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> [iMTT]) middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perfusion lesion volumes were correlated with 30-day T2-weighted MRI lesion volumes and with clinical outcome using the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Spearman correlation coefficients for comparing lesion volumes delineated on DWI, CBF, iCBF, cCBF, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>, iMTT, and cMTT maps with 30-day T2-weighted lesion volumes were 0.72, 0.87, 0.88, 0.90, 0.84, 0.92, and 0.96, respectively (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The analogous correlation coefficients for comparing 30-day National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) scores were 0.39 (NS), 0.69 (NS), 0.75 (P&lt;0.001), 0.62 (NS), 0.72 (P&lt;0.001), 0.78 (P&lt;0.001), and 0.83 (P&lt;0.001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Uncorrected perfusion lesion volumes overestimated the extent of ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BDC perfusion measures (cMTT) correlated more accurately with final lesion volume and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Such measures offer an improved estimation of the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
