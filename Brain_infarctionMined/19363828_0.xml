<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-eight patients of pyramidal tract <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase (&lt;3 days) with a marked motor defect were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lesions were identified on diffusion weighted imaging and isotropic imaging of DTI, and infarctions and the tract were shown on the DTT images simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The anatomic location and pattern of the lesions were visualized on DTT, with regard of the corticospinal tract (CST), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were divided into three clinical subgroups: in Group 1 infarction lesions were close to CST, in Group 2 CST was partial involved, in Group 3 lesions centered in the pyramidal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, they were compared with the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) scores at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase (&lt;3 days), early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase (8 approximately 14 days), and outcome(30 approximately 60 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULT: NIHSS scores of Group 1(12/28) were not different with those of Group 2 (11/28) at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase (U=-1.430, P&gt;0.05), and NIHSS scores in Group 2 were significantly lower than those of Group 3(5/28) (U= -2.676, P &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the outcome, NIHSS scores of Group 1 were significantly lower than those of Group 2 (U= -2.501, P&lt;0.05), NIHSS scores of Group 2 were significantly lower than those of Group 3 (U= -2.948, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among these three groups,Group 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had good recovery, Group 2 also had good recovery but sometimes with some mild motor disfunction, and Group 3 always had marked defect and minor improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both rADC value and rFA value were induced in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DTT is helpful in prognestic valuation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> by providing visualized stereo localization of CST and infarction lesions </plain></SENT>
