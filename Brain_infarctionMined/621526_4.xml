<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36932">oxygen-15</z:chebi> inhalation technique is shown to be a unique tool in investigating cerebrovascular disorders because of its non-invasiveness and its ability to define regional metabolism-to-perfusion imbalance within the brain </plain></SENT>
