<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The frequency of lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was examined over a 20-year period in a large collection of autopsy material and was compared with the official mortality statistics for the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency of lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the autopsy material was calculated as a percentage of the total number of autopsied patients in the corresponding age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> found in mortality statistics was calculated as a percentage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the corresponding age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the autopsy material the over-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> frequency fell by 14 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For patients between 40 and 69 years the decline was 25 percent while for patients over 70 years only a minor drop was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most marked decline was 25 percent while for patients over 70 years only a minor drop was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most marked decline was found for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> which decreased by 70 percent in patients between 40 and 69 and by 33 percent for those over 70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> the decline was 32 percent in the youngest age group while patients over 70 showed no decrease at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MOrtality statistics showed a steady decline in the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and the overall figures in the 2 sources were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Figures fo the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> sub-groups (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>) were markedly different from those found in the autopsy records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was several times greater than that of infarction in mortality statistics while the reverse was true in the autopsy records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The sources of error are discusses for both materials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the over-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> figures for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> are largely reliable for both autopsy records and mortality statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the mortality statistics the separate figures for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> and infarction were not correct and long term changes in frequency of these conditions would be interpreted with caution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The figures from the autopsy material are considered to be more reliable and it is concluded that the decline in <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and infarction described is real </plain></SENT>
