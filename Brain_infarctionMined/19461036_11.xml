<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Determining cognitive dysfunctioning (CDF) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is an important issue because it influences choices for management in terms of return to previous activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because previous research in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has shown important variations in CDF rates, we aimed to describe the frequency and neuropsychological profile of CDF in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outside <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a large battery of tests to screen any potentially hidden CDF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with Mini-Mental State Examination scores &gt;or=23 were prospectively and consecutively included 2 weeks after a first-ever ischemic brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> features were based on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four domains were evaluated: instrumental and executive functions, episodic memory, and working memory (WM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were scored using means and compared with education- and age-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Then we attributed Z-scores for each test and each domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most relevant cognitive tests characterizing CDF were determined using logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 177 patients (mean age, 50.6 years), 91.5% failed in at least one cognitive domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>WM was the most impaired domain (87.6%) with executive functions (64.4%), episodic memory (64.4%), and instrumental functions (24.9%) being relatively preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CDF was associated with age, education, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, neurological deficit, and leukoaraiosis in bivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Using logistic regression, WM tests and age predicted CDF (Modified Paced Auditorial Serial Addition Test: OR=0.96 CI=0.93 to 0.98; Owen-spatial-WM: OR=1.07 CI=1.02 to 1.12; age: OR=0.96 CI=0.93 to 0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CDF appears to be almost constant, although underestimated, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>WM could reflect some hidden dysfunctioning, which may interfere with rehabilitation and return to work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Clinical routine may include WM tests in young patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
