<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aims were to determine risk factors, clinical and imaging variables and prognostic differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we prospectively investigated 264 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> between 1996 and 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients were categorized to one of four major <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> subtype based on TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Treatment) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age was greater in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of undetermined etiology (SUE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was higher in patients with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (LAC) than other subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Smoking was less frequent in patients with cardioembolism (CARD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was largest in patients with large artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (LAA) while there were no differences in location or conversion of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> into <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportion of the patients with milder neurological deficits at entry was higher in patients with LAC subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of independent patients were different between subtypes: 62% in LAC, 43% in CARD, 38% in SUE, 35% in LAA at discharge ( p=0.01), and 91% in LAC, 69% in CARD, 59% in SUE, 60% in LAA at 6 months ( p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recurrence rates were not different between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that risk factors, clinical imaging variables are different among <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> subtypes and that neurological status on admission and during follow-up strongly favors LAC </plain></SENT>
