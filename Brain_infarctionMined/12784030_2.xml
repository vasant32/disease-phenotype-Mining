<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cognitive and behavioral course in patients with probable VaD-L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We longitudinally measured rates of change on MMSE, digit span, logical memory, Controlled Oral Word Association, CERAD battery and neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) in 77 patients (age at entry 69 +/- 8.1 years) with probable VaD-L for 25.75 +/- 11 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean number of follow-up visits was 2.6 +/- 0.67 (range 2-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Time interval between any two consecutive visits was at least 5 months (range 5-41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MMSE deteriorated by 1.44+/- 1.8 points annually and NPI increased by 6.01 +/- 13.7 points annually (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rates of cognitive and behavioral decline were predominantly influenced by the cognitive state at entry into the study and the occurrence of new vascular episodes during follow-up [(-0.95 +/- 1.7) MMSE and (+2.02 +/- 14.1) NPI points annually without vascular episodes vs. (-2.09 +/- 1.6) and (+11.3 +/- 11.4) points following vascular episodes (p &lt; 0.0001)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Impaired cognition</z:e> was associated with impaired behavior (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>VaD-L patients without additional vascular episodes at follow-up have a progressively deteriorating course as well (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: VaD-L is characterized by cognitive and behavioral decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rate of decline is determined mainly by the severity of the cognitive and behavioral impairment at baseline and by the occurrence of new vascular episodes </plain></SENT>
