<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether or not MCI-186 is effective in reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury in the extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1567664" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Warm ischemia</z:e> was sustained for 4 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were divided into 4 groups: (1) sham group, (2) control group (saline injection), (3) MCI group (MCI-186 injection), and (4) EPC group (EPC-K1 [(l-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> 2-[3,4-dihydro-2, 5,7,8-tetramethyl-2-(4,8,12-trimethyltridecyl)-2H-1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22727">benzopyran</z:chebi>-6-yl hydrogen phosphate] <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26218">potassium salt</z:chebi>], a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl-radical</z:chebi> scavenger, injection) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Wet and dry (W/D) weights of the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles, muscle contractile function, and serum levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> phosphokinase (CPK), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH), glutamic oxaloacetic transminase (GOT), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> glutamic oxaloacetic transminase (GOT-m) were measured after 24 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxic <z:chebi fb="5" ids="17478">aldehydes</z:chebi> malondialdehyde and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32585">4-hydroxy-2-nonenal</z:chebi> as indices of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation (LPO), and neutrophil-specific enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) as an index of neutrophil infiltration, were measured in the gastrocnemius muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Contractile functions in the MCI and EPC groups were significantly better than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the tibialis anterior muscle, the contractile function was better in the MCI group than in the EPC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>W/D ratios and serum levels of CPK, LDH, GOT, and GOT-m were lower in the sham and MCI groups than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Levels of LPO and MPO activity were significantly lower in the MCI and EPC groups than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histological findings demonstrated that inflammatory tissue reactions rarely occurred in the MCI group </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MCI-186 seems to have promise as a therapeutic agent, because it prevents <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury even in the tibialis anterior muscle, which contains fast-twitch glycolytic fibers, known to be very susceptible to ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
