<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">Berberine</z:chebi> blocked transient outward <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current (IA) and delayed rectifier <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current (IK) in a concentration-dependent manner with EC50 of 22.94+/-4.96 microM and 10.86+/-1.06 microM, Emax of 67.47+/-4.00% and 67.14+/-1.79%, n of 0.77+/-0.08 and 0.96+/-0.07, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">Berberine</z:chebi> 30 microM shifted the steady-state activation curve and inactivation curve of IA to more negative potentials, but mainly affected the inactivation kinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">Berberine</z:chebi> 30 microM positively shifted the steady-state activation curve of IK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that blockades on K+ currents by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">berberine</z:chebi> are preferential for IK, and contribute to its protective action against ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
