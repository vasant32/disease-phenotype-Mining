<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using this technique, the distribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> volumes has been recently reported in patients with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal-dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> with subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> (CADASIL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whether the volume of each lacune (individual lacunar volume [ILV]) is associated with the patients' other MRI lesions or vascular risk factors has never been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to study the impact of age, vascular risk factors, and MRI markers on the ILV in a large cohort of patients with CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 113 patients with CADASIL, 1568 lacunes were detected and ILV was estimated after automatic segmentation on 3-dimensional T1-weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relationships between ILV and age, blood pressure, cholesterol, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, white matter hyperintensities load, number of cerebral microbleeds, apparent diffusion coefficient, brain parenchymal fraction, and mean and median of distribution of lacunes volumes at the patient level were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We used random effect models to take into account intraindividual correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ILV varied from 4.28 to 1619 mm(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ILV was not significantly correlated with age, vascular risk factors, or different MRI markers (white matter hyperintensity volume, cerebral microbleed number, mean apparent diffusion coefficient or brain parenchymal fraction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, ILV was positively correlated with the patients' mean and median of lacunar volume distribution (P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the ILV is not related to the associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> or to vascular risk factors in CADASIL, but that an individual predisposition may explain predominating small or predominating large lacunes among patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Local anatomic factors or genetic factors may be involved in these variations </plain></SENT>
