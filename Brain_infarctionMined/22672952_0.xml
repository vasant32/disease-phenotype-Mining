<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gross motor function was assessed according to the locomotor and mobility subset of the functional independence measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CVR was measured as the difference in the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> (ACZ)-challenged(99m)Tc-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> perfusion SPECT from baseline rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 22 hemiplegic patients (mean age, 60.97 years) enrolled were admitted at a mean of 20.86 days from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and received rehabilitation care for an average of 38.82 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The recovery of gross motor function was significantly correlated with baseline rCBF and CVR of ACZ-SPECT in the areas of affected supratentorial hemisphere (r=0.447 and r=0.444, respectively, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the linear regression model, adjusted for time to SPECT testing, revealed that the CVR in the affected supratentorial hemisphere was a significant predictor of the gross motor outcome (p&lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the CVR of the affected supratentorial hemisphere may be employed along with other parameters to predict the gross motor recovery of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> infarction </plain></SENT>
