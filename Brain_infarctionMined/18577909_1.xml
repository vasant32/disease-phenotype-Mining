<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 72-year-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, old <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> was transferred to the hospital because of obstinate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo>, The initial computed tomography (CT) scan revealed giant (TAAA), and from the laboratory findings, the white blood cell and C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly elevated 12,400/mm3 and 23.9 mg/dL respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on the CT and laboratory findings, a mycotic TAAA was highly suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the remission of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, graft replacement with reconstruction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">celiac</z:e> trunk (CA) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) was performed via spiral incision under extracorporeal circulation. two months after the first operation, the patient complained about his <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo> again </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CT showed a pseudoaneurysm which formed at the distal anastomotic site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A hybrid procedure was deemed to be the most appropriate for such patient who needs a second operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>First bilateral renal artery bypass (ilio-renal artery bypass) were done using the saphenous vein grafts (SVGs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following bypass grafting to renal arteries, endovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> repair was performed with handmade stent-graft which was fabricated using a self-expanding "Z" stent and woven Dacron graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The postoperative course was uneventful, and follow-up CT showed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> to have shrunk with no endoleaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At six months after hybrid procedure, the shrinkage of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> sac and the patency of the graft to renal arteries were confirmed by a CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A hybrid procedure is considered to be useful and feasible for the poor surgical candidate with severe comorbidities, hostile abdomen and a complex <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The long-term results of this hybrid procedure is considered to be promising </plain></SENT>
