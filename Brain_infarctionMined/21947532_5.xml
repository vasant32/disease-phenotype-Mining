<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the interrelations of serum <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> markers with brain volumes, cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and performance in different cognitive domains in a biracial population sample cross-sectionally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 121 community-dwelling participants of the Chicago Health and Aging Project, serum markers of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> status were related to summary measures of neuropsychological tests of 5 cognitive domains and brain MRI measures obtained on average 4.6 years later among 121 older adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Concentrations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi>-related markers, but not serum <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> itself, were associated with global cognitive function and with total brain volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methylmalonate levels were associated with poorer episodic memory and perceptual speed, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17755">cystathionine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15598,30836">2-methylcitrate</z:chebi> with poorer episodic and semantic memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Homocysteine</z:chebi> concentrations were associated with decreased total brain volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>-global cognition effect was modified and no longer statistically significant with adjustment for white matter volume or cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The methylmalonate-global cognition effect was modified and no longer significant with adjustment for total brain volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Methylmalonate, a specific marker of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi> deficiency, may affect cognition by reducing total brain volume whereas the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (nonspecific to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100502'>vitamin B12 deficiency</z:hpo>) on cognitive performance may be mediated through increased white matter hyperintensity and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">Vitamin B12</z:chebi> status may affect the brain through multiple mechanisms </plain></SENT>
