<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether LXA(4)ME could ameliorate blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) dysfunction after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by reducing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult male rats were subjected to 2-h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by 24-h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain infarctions</z:e> were detected by triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> dysfunction was determined by examining <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and Evans Blue extravasation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Temporal expression of MMP-9 was determined by zymography and Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) was also determined by Western blot in tissue protein sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>Brain edema</z:hpo> and Evans Blue leakage were significantly reduced after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the LXA(4)ME group and were associated with reduced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MMP-9 activity and expression were inhibited by LXA(4)ME after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, LXA(4)ME significantly increased TIMP-1 protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that LXA(4)ME reduces brain injury by improving <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> function in a rat model of MCAO, and that a relationship exists between <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability and MMP-9 expression following ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these results suggest that LXA(4)ME-mediated reduction of MMP-9 following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are attributed to increased TIMP-1 expression </plain></SENT>
