<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to identify preoperative brain MRI characteristics, incidence, and related factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesions in left-sided IE patients undergoing cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we investigated whether preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesions are associated with postoperative neurological complications in IE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients with a definite left-sided IE who underwent cardiac surgery in 6 university-affiliated hospitals from January 2004 to November 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative brain MRI evaluations were systematically performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients without contraindications, regardless of neurological complications, with the aim of preventing perioperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were included if diffusion-weighted imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences were performed within 14 days after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Associations between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesions and related factors were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurological complications within 30 days after surgery were evaluated for postoperative outcome analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results: Of 139 consecutive patients with left-sided IE who underwent cardiac surgery, 85 patients were evaluated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 58 Â± 16 years, and 22 patients (26%) were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Preoperative MRI revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesions in 47 patients (55%), and 19 of these patients developed neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among the patients with ischemic lesions, 24 (60%) had small lesions (&lt;10 mm), 36 (77%) had multiple lesions, and 30 (64%) had lesions in multiple vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Compared to patients without ischemic lesions, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesions were older and had significantly higher white blood cell counts and plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, but lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analyses showed that the white blood cell count and plasma CRP level were independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesions [adjusted OR per 1-SD increase were 2.21 (95% CI: 1.23-4.35) and 2.33 (95% CI: 1.27-4.96), respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Three patients developed postoperative neurological complications, but preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesions and postoperative complications were not associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Preoperative MRI detected a high incidence of asymptomatic ischemic lesions in IE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesions were often small, multiple, and located in multiple vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory reactions may play an important role in the development of ischemic lesions in IE patients </plain></SENT>
