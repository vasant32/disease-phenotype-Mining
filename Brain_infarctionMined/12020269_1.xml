<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze the frequency and pathogenetic factors of crossed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001272'>cerebellar atrophy</z:hpo> (CCA) in adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> secondary to destructive brain insults of early development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 51 adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and precocious destructive lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into 3 groups according to the topographic distribution of their lesions on magnetic resonance imaging: group A, hemispheric (n = 9); group B, main arterial territory (n = 25); and group C, arterial border zone (n = 17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the presence of CCA visually and with cerebellar volumetric measurement, correlating it with the clinical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other features shown on magnetic resonance imaging, such as the thalamus, brainstem, and middle cerebellar peduncle, were also carefully analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven patients (13%) had CCA that was associated with the extent of the supratentorial lesion (6 from group A, 1 from group B, and none from group C; P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>Status epilepticus</z:hpo> was present in 6 patients from group A and in none from the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was an association between the antecedent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> and CCA (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the cerebral peduncle ipsilateral to the supratentorial lesion and 4 had contralateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the middle cerebellar peduncle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> was not associated with the presence of CCA (P =.20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and destructive insults early in life, the extent of the supratentorial lesion as well as the antecedent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> play a major role in the pathogenesis of CCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> do not seem to be relevant to the development of CCA </plain></SENT>
