<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify the etiopathogenic mechanisms of pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> we analyzed the vascular findings and their association with MRI lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical features and vascular findings on transcranial Doppler (TCD) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography (MRA) of 67 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> involving the pons were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was assessed by modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores on admission and 2 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two groups of isolated pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were found on the basis of lesion location on MRI, according to the extent or not to the anterior surface of the pons: paramedian pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>, n = 36) and lacunar pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LPI</z:e>, n = 31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was the most common vascular risk factor and pure motor syndrome was the most frequent clinical profile in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> found on TCD or MRA was significantly more frequent amongst the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On admission and 2 months later, the mRS scores of the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> group were significantly worse (P &lt; 0.0001) than those of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LPI</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> have a significantly higher frequency of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and they have a worse prognosis than patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LPI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
