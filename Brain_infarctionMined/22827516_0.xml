<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, 3-alkyl/arylalkyl-substituted benzo[c]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30856">thiophen</z:chebi>-1(3H)-ones (5a-h) were designed and synthesized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most active compound 5d significantly inhibited the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>) induced and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> (AA) induced in vitro platelet aggregation, superior to clinically used antiplatelet drug aspirin (ASP) and anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> drugs 3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> (Eda) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More importantly, in comparison with both NBP and Eda, 5d exhibited stronger antithrombotic and free radical scavenging activities and better or comparable neuroprotective effects against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion (I/R) in rats by ameliorating neurobehavioral function, reducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and brain-water content, attenuating cerebral damage, and normalizing the levels of oxidative enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, our findings may provide an alternative strategy for the design of novel anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> agents more potent than drugs like NBP and Eda </plain></SENT>
