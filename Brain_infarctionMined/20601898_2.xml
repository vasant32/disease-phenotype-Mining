<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 30) were categorized into group 2 (IS only) and group 3 (IS plus intraperitoneal erythropoietin 5000 IU/kg at 0, 12, and 24 hours after IS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Healthy Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 10) served as group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analysis of brain tissues showed larger BIA in group 2 than in group 3 (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Corner test identified highest frequency of left turn in group 2 (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of Bax, caspase 3, interleukin 18, toll-like receptor 4, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 were highest, whereas Bcl-2 was lowest in group 2 (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lower CXCR4 and stromal cell-derived factor 1 expressions were noted in group 2 than in group 3 (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistofluorescence staining showed lower expressions of CXCR4, stromal cell-derived factor 1, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor, and doublecortin with higher number of apoptotic nuclei in group 2 than in group 3 (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated lower cellular proliferation and number of small vessels with higher glial fibrillary acid protein expression in group 2 than in group 3 (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Erythropoietin significantly limited BIA and improved sensorimotor dysfunction after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> IS </plain></SENT>
