<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Normobaric <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp> (NBO) has been shown to be neuroprotective, extending the therapeutic time window for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, but the mechanism is not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, using a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, we investigated the effect of early NBO treatment on neuronal NO production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given normoxia (30% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>) or NBO (95% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>) during 10, 30, 60 or 90min filament occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NO(x)(-) (<z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> plus nitrate) and 3-nitrotyrosine were measured in the ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> caused a rapid increase in the production of NO(x)(-), with a peak at 10min after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, then gradually declining to the baseline level at 60min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NBO treatment delayed the NO(x)(-) production peak to 30min and attenuated the total amount of NO(x)(-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> also increased 3-nitrotyrosine formation, which was significantly reduced by NBO treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of nNOS by pre-treatment with 7-nitroindazole had similar effect as NBO treatment on NO(x)(-) and 3-nitrotyrosine production, and when combined with NBO, no further reduction in NO production was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, NBO treatment significantly decreased brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our findings demonstrate that delaying and attenuating the early NO release from nNOS may be an important mechanism accounting for NBO's neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
