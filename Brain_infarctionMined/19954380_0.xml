<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We would like to describe a case report of posterior ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo> (PION) misdiagnosed as arteritic PION with presumed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCA</z:e> which leads to missing the correct diagnosis with fatal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical course of a single patient will be described including presentation, testing,diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An 82-year-old male patient presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and temporal tenderness and mildly elevated ESR and was treated with steroids for presumed diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000529'>progressive visual loss</z:hpo> to NLP in the left eye while on steroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI Brain and orbit showed enhanced mass at orbital apex misdiagnosed as incidental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic biopsy was done and the pathology exam showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004030" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aspergillosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient later died after he developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004030" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aspergillosis</z:e> fungal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> with subsequent multiple brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> despite appropriate antifungal treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Over-diagnosis of Giant cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> and unwise use of steroids in elderly without appropriate work-ups can lead to unfavorable outcomes including a delay in diagnosis and an exacerbation of occult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> that would manifest weeks later with a fatal outcome </plain></SENT>
