<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate a modified method of intraluminal suture occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) on the volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and on neurobehavioral function in rats subjected to a temporary focal ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> and subjected to 60 minutes or 2 hours of temporary <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (MCAo) by an intraluminal thread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In one group of rats, the suture was coated with poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi>, while in a second group, a conventional uncoated suture was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Behavioral function was evaluated at 50 to 60 minutes after occlusion and during a 3-day period after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three days after MCAo brains were perfusion-fixed and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In rats with 60-minute MCAo, only 3 of 7 animals with uncoated sutures had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, whereas in the group with poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi>-coated sutures, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats (n = 7) exhibited infarction (P = .009, Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With 2 hours of MCAo, total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (corrected for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>) was significantly larger in rats with poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi>-coated sutures than in the group with uncoated sutures (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>, 122.1 +/- 4.8 versus 67.0 +/- 18.2 mm3, respectively; P = .03; n = 4 in each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 2-hour MCAo study, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes in the uncoated-suture group tended to be variable and inconsistent (coefficient of variation, 54%) compared with the group in which sutures were coated with poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi>, in which a highly consistent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was produced (coefficient of variation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, 8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reversible MCAo in which a poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi>-coated intraluminal suture was used proved to be a reliable and effective modification of this technique, yielding consistently larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and greatly reduced interanimal variability </plain></SENT>
