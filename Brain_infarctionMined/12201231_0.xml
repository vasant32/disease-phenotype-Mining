<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are made up of veins with abnormal structure: thick walls, lumens dilated and of irregular calibre that converge radially towards a wide draining vein (caput medusae) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Authors report three patients with cerebellar venous anomalies associated either with pontine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018920" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cavernoma</z:e>, cerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> or cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They illustrate that cerebellar venous anomalies are benign conditions, but their presence might be a marker for additional, pathogenic malformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It might be difficult to detect the associated malformations even by sophisticated imaging methods, but their presence can modify the treatment options </plain></SENT>
