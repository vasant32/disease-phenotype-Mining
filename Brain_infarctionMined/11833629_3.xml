<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence supporting this practice is lacking, and it may reflect inappropriate generalization of findings from studies conducted primarily on traumatic brain injury patients with associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a repeated measures design to conduct a pilot study of the effect of three HOB positions on middle cerebral artery mean flow velocities (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-MFV) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler (TCD) sonography was used to measure <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-MFV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients were enrolled in the study; the mean age of the sample was 60 years, and the mean National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score was 8.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On average, a 9.2% increase in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-MFV was measured when the HOB was lowered to 15 degrees from the 30 degrees elevation standard (p = .02); <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-MFV increased on average by 3.9% when the HOB was again lowered from the 15 degrees position to the 0 degrees (flat) position (p = not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and pulse pressure remained stable without significant change throughout the positioning intervention and measurement period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall increase in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-MFV achieved from lowering the HOB position from 30 degrees to a flat position was 13.1% (p = .054) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings from this small sample suggest that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> may benefit from lower HOB positions, in particular flat positioning, to promote an increase in flow to ischemic brain tissue that may ultimately reduce brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
