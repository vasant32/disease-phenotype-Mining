<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify, in the first 5 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, clinical and radiologic predictors of subsequent hemorrhagic transformation (HT), and to evaluate its influence on the clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The identification of early predictors of HT might be important to plan antithrombotic or thrombolytic treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: One hundred fifty consecutive patients with cerebral anterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> systematically underwent a first CT within 5 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the first week after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we performed a repeat CT or autopsy to look for HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures were early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deterioration</z:hpo> within the first week of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and 30-day case fatality rate and disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HT was observed in 65 patients (43%): 58 (89%) had a petechial HT and seven (11%) a <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among initial clinical an CT findings, the only independent predictor of HT was early focal hypodensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Its presence was associated with subsequent HT in 77% of cases (95% CI, 68 to 86%), whereas its absence predicted the absence of subsequent HT in 94% of cases (95% CI, 89 to 99%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No baseline clinical or CT characteristic differentiated patients with petechial HT from those with <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Antithrombotic and antiplatelet agents did not influence the occurrence of either type of HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequency of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deterioration</z:hpo> and of 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or disability in HT patients was twice as high as in those without HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, a large-sized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and the presence of mass effect at the repeat CT or autopsy were the only factors independently linked to both the outcome events, irrespective of the development of HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinical evolution of HT patients given antithrombotics was comparable with that of HT patients not receiving these drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HT of a brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> is a common event that occurs independently of anticoagulation and can be reliably predicted as early as 5 hours from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> by the presence of focal hypodensity at CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Apart from the infrequent cases of massive <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, HT does not influence prognosis, whereas a poor outcome in HT patients is correlated with a higher frequency of large edematous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in this subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The clinical course and final outcome of HT in anticoagulated patients does not differ from that of non-anticoagulated HT patients </plain></SENT>
