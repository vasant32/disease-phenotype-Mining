<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe an automated procedure for analysis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in TTC-stained rat brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and killed after 24 to 36 hours, and their brains were processed for TTC staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Digital images of coronal sections from these brains (n &gt; 50) were acquired with a desktop color scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The resulting images were divided into red, blue, and green component images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total brain and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas were automatically determined on the basis of total pixel intensity and area after segmentation of the red and green images, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Automated measurements were compared with those made with a video camera-based image acquisition system that required manual tracing of lesion boundaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The spatial resolution of scanned brain images (approximately equal to 200 microns) was comparable to that of the camera-based system and provided sufficient detail to recognize <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> boundaries and neuroanatomical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Scanner-based acquisition and analysis were faster than with the camera-based method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The green component image accurately distinguished infarcted from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain, and the red component image represented total brain dimensions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> measurements obtained by the automated method correlated closely with those from conventional apparatus (R2 = .89, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Intraobserver reliability with the automated method (R2 = 1.00) was higher than with the conventional method (R2 = .77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat can be rapidly and reproducibly assessed with inexpensive scanning equipment and automated image analysis of TTC-stained brains </plain></SENT>
