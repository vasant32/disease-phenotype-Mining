<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Age-related white matter changes (ARWMC), seen on neuroimaging with high frequency in older people, are thought to be consequent to the effect of vascular risk factors and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the proofs conventionally required for a factor to be considered a risk factor for a definite pathology, there is the demonstration of a trend in risk exposure related to disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought whether such a trend existed in the association of vascular risk factors or comorbidities with the severity of ARWMC aiming particularly at further elucidating the relative roles of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in this regard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The LADIS (Leukoaraiosis and Disability) Study is evaluating the role of ARWMC as an independent determinant of the transition to disability in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six hundred and thirty-nine nondisabled subjects (mean age 74.1+/-5.0, M/F: 288/351) with ARWMC of different severity grades on MRI (mild, moderate, or severe according to the Fazekas scale) were assessed at baseline for demographics, vascular risk factors, and comorbidities, and are being followed up for 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age, frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> increased along with increasing ARWMC severity independently of other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, however, this occurred only in subjects without a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> history, while for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> history, it mainly depended on lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The amount of cigarettes smoked and the interaction between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> and smoking predicted only the most severe ARWMC grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The LADIS Study confirms that age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> are the major determinants of ARWMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Smoking and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> provide additional risk </plain></SENT>
