<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms of action still have not been fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study is the evaluation of potential neuroprotective effects produced by HUCBC in terms of reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and caspase-3-dependent cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was induced in 90 spontaneously hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The animals were randomly assigned to the control group (n=49) or the verum group (n=41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cell suspension (8 Ã— 10(6) HUCBC per kilogram bodyweight) or vehicle solution was intravenously administered 24h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty subjects (n=25/25) were sacrificed after 25, 48, 72 and 96h, and brain specimens were removed for immunohistochemistry for MAP2, cleaved caspase-3 (casp3) and GFAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Another 42 animals (n=26/16) were sacrificed after 0, 6, 24, 36 and 48h and their brains processed for quantitative PCR for casp3 and survivin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume remained stable over the entire experimental period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, cleaved casp3 activity increased significantly in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> border zone within the same time frame </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Numerous cleaved casp3-positive cells were colocalized with the astrocytic marker GFAP, whereas cleavage of neuronal casp3 was observed rarely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neither the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume nor casp3 activity was significantly affected by cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Delayed systemic transplantation of HUCBC failed to produce neuroprotective effects in a permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model using premorbid subjects </plain></SENT>
