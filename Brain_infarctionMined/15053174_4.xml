<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging findings of wallerian degeneration of the pontocerebellar tract secondary to a pontine infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed cranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images obtained during the past seven years in our institution and selected those from patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage of pontine infarction and a hyperintense lesion at the central portion of the middle cerebellar peduncle on T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In three patients with a ventromedial pontine infarction, we found a symmetrical hyperintense lesion at the central portion of the middle cerebellar peduncle bilaterally on T2-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In another patient with a ventrolateral pontine infarction, we found such a lesion at the ipsilateral middle cerebellar peduncle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Because the middle cerebellar peduncle carries afferent fibers from the contralateral basis pontis to the cerebellar cortex, these middle cerebellar peduncular lesions are regarded as wallerian degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This secondary degeneration should not be misinterpreted as a newly developed infarction or other disease </plain></SENT>
