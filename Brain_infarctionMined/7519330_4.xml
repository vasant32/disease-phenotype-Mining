<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was performed to compare brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size assessment by routine histology (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin) and by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>New Zealand white rabbits were subjected to autologous clot embolization to the anterior circulation of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After a study period of 7-8 h the brains were harvested and serially sectioned in the coronal plane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain slices were then immersed in a 1% triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> dye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following visualization of the infarcted region, the brains were immediately placed in 10% formalin and later prepared for histologic evaluation by routine <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two methods were compared for their ability to estimate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size by an independent observer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was excellent correlation between the two methodologies; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> sizes of 57.4 +/- 5.0% versus 55.9 +/- 5.4% (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>, p &lt; 0.007, r = 0.73, n = 12; expressed as percentage of the hemisphere infarcted) were noted for light microscopic evaluation versus triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining is an acceptable method for delineating brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in this rabbit model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relative ease of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size determination with this technique suggests its more widespread use in similar models </plain></SENT>
