<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thirteen consecutive twin pregnancies affected by the "stuck twin" phenomenon were reviewed to determine the potential benefit of serial amniocenteses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The fetal survival rate for the eight pregnancies that underwent serial amniocenteses was 69% (11 of 16 fetuses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is significantly improved compared with a fetal survival rate of 20% among the five preceding pregnancies managed without serial amniocenteses at the same institution (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is also markedly improved compared with a combined fetal survival rate of 16% among 48 previously reported pregnancies with the stuck twin phenomenon managed without serial amniocenteses (p less than 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival correlated with the absence of concomitant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> (i.e., <z:hpo ids='HP_0008071'>maternal hypertension</z:hpo> or intractable labor) and with the absence of severe fetal structural abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Procedural complications occurred in three of eight pregnancies (37.5%) managed with serial amniocenteses and was attributed as a cause of fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of 11 survivors (18%) had complications after serial amniocenteses including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0008682'>renal tubular necrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serial amniocenteses may significantly improve the survival rate of twin gestations affected by the stuck twin phenomenon but may be associated with complications among survivors </plain></SENT>
