<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The current study focused on blood-brain barrier disruption and neurovascular damage induced by engineered nanomaterials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exposure to nanoalumina, but not to nanocarbon, induced a dose-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> potential collapse, increased autophagy of brain endothelial cells, and decreased expression of the tight-junction proteins occludin and claudin-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of autophagy by pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">Wortmannin</z:chebi> attenuated the effects of nanoalumina on decreased claudin-5 expression; however, it did not affect the disruption of occludin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings were confirmed in mice by administration of nanoalumina into the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systemic treatment with nanoalumina elevated autophagy-related genes and autophagic activity in the brain, decreased tight-junction protein expression, and elevated blood-brain barrier permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, exposure to nanoalumina, but not to nanocarbon, increased brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in mice subjected to a focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, our study reveals that autophagy constitutes an important mechanism involved in nanoalumina-induced neurovascular toxicity in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: In this paper, the effects of nanoalumina on the permeability of the blood-brain barrier is reported, suggesting that autophagy is an important mechanism in nanoalumina-induced neurovascular toxicity </plain></SENT>
