<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> that accompanies an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> has previously been attributed to a necrotic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, numerous studies in experimental models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> have recently indicated that programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, also called <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, may contribute to neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the intrathecal levels of proteins regulating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and to relate these levels to brain damage and to production of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were studied prospectively on days 0 to 4, 7 to 9, 21 to 26, and after day 90 with clinical evaluation, radiological assessment, and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of soluble (s) Fas/<z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-1 and sbcl-2, 2 proteins that regulate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, analysis of the intrathecal levels of cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nineteen CSF samples from healthy subjects were used for control purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients were examined with MRI 1 to 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> for measurement of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume RESULTS: Significantly decreased CSF levels of sFas/<z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-1 were observed during the entire observation period, with a maximal decrease on day 21 after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The intrathecal levels of sFas/<z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-1 were significantly negatively correlated with the volume of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and with the neurological deficit 3 weeks and 3 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the intrathecal levels of sFas/<z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-1 were significantly correlated with the levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, and GM-CSF 3 weeks after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The intrathecal levels of sbcl-2 were significantly decreased during the first 3 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and at the same time were positively correlated with the levels of IL-6 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates decreased intrathecal levels of proteins with antiapoptotic properties, suggesting that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> display a propensity toward <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Control of factors regulating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> may lead to decreased delayed brain damage in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
