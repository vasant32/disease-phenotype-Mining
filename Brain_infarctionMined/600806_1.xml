<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A comparison of the brain scans showed neoplastic lesions to be visualized more clearly with 99mTc-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi>, and vascular lesions to be demonstrated better with 99mTc-pertechnetate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparative brain scanning utilizing 99mTc-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> and 99mTc-pertechnetate facilitates the differentiation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and neoplastic lesions which is difficult or may be impossible by cerebral computer tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reduced radiation exposure from 99mTc-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> and its superior usefulness in the visualization of neoplastic lesions suggest its use as the primary brain scanning agent </plain></SENT>
