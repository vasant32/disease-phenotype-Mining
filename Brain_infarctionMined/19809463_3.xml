<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured with laser-Doppler flowmetry in the penumbral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size was evaluated 24 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of these drugs on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size were examined by pretreatment of rats undergoing <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with cilostazol (100 mg/kg) significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, aspirin (10 mg/kg) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> (3 mg/kg) failed to mitigate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, regardless of their apparent inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Post-treatment with cilostazol also significantly attenuated the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, associated with improved CBF in the penumbral region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In support of this effect, cilostazol increased nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) production and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi>-I(2) (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="26345">PGI</z:chebi>(2)) release in cultured human brain microvascular endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cilostazol-induced NO production and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26345">PGI</z:chebi>(2) release were completely abolished by an NO synthase inhibitor and aspirin, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings show that cilostazol reduced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size due to an improvement in penumbral CBF possibly in association with increased endothelial NO and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26345">PGI</z:chebi>(2) production </plain></SENT>
