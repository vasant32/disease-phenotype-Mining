<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Early studies showed that the administration of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL10) protects against permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, transgenic mice expressing murine IL10 (IL10T) directed by the major histocompatibility complex Ea promoter were produced and used to explore the effect of chronically increased IL10 levels on MCAO-related molecular mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IL10 was over-expressed in astrocytes, microglia, and endothelial brain cells in IL10T compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four days following MCAO, IL10T mice showed a 40% reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size which was associated to significantly reduced levels of active caspase 3 compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Under basal conditions, anti-inflammatory factors such as nerve growth factor and GSH were up-regulated and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1beta was down-regulated in the brain of IL10T animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, these mice displayed increased basal GSH levels in microglial and endothelial cells as well as a marked increase in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase in endothelial lining blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, IL10T mice showed a marked reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, and IL1beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that constitutive IL10 over-expression is associated with a striking resistance to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> that may be attributed to changes in the basal redox properties of glial/endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
