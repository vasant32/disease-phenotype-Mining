<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Poor kidney function, as measured by glomerular filtration rate (GFR), is closely associated with presence of glomerular small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given the hemodynamic similarities between the vascular beds of the kidney and the brain, we hypothesized an association between kidney function and markers of cerebral small vessel disease on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated this association in a population-based study of elderly persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured GFR using the Cockcroft-Gault equation in 484 participants (60 to 90 years of age) from the Rotterdam Scan Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using automated MRI-analysis we measured global as well as lobar and deep volumes of gray matter and white matter, and volume of WML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were rated visually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Volumes of deep white matter and WML and presence of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> reflected cerebral small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We used linear and logistic regression models to investigate the association between GFR and brain imaging parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and additionally for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Persons with lower GFR had less deep white matter volume (difference in standardized volume per SD decrease in GFR: -0.15 [95% CI -0.26 to -0.04]), more WML (difference per SD decrease in GFR: 0.14 [95% CI 0.03 to 0.25]), and more often lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, although the latter was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>GFR was not associated with gray matter volume or lobar white matter volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additional adjustment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> yielded similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Impaired kidney function is associated with markers of cerebral small vessel disease as assessed on MRI </plain></SENT>
