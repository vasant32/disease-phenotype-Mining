<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to further explore the mechanisms by which activation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channels (mitoKATP) confers neuroprotection, we investigated the role of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> permeability transition pore (MPTP) in in vivo and in vitro models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 90 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by reperfusion for 22 h, when neurological scores and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Activating mitoKATP by infusion of 2 mmol/L <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> into the ventricles 20 min before MCAO or inhibiting the MPTP by infusion of 1 micromol/L <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> 15 min before reperfusion significantly increased functional score and reduced infarction volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequent intracerebroventricular infusion of 2 mmol/L atractyloside, the MPTP opener, 10 min before reperfusion significantly attenuated the neuroprotective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The swelling of mitochondria isolated from brain was evaluated by spectrophotometry and served as a measure of MPTP opening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In isolated mitochondria, 100 micromol/L atractyloside attenuated the decrease of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> swelling induced by 30 micromol/L <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (0.5 or 1 micromol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 100 micromol/L <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> or 1 micromol/L <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> both attenuated the fluorescence intensity in isolated mitochondria loaded with rhod-2 acetoxymethylester, and 100 micromol/L atractyloside abolished the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that activation of mitoKATP protects the brain against injury, and this is probably mediated by attenuating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> overload and thus inhibiting MPTP opening during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
