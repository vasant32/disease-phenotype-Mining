<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the relation between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and clinical and neuropsychologic manifestations in patients with autopsy-proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) enrolled in the Consortium to Establish a Registry for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> (CERAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Prior studies report that subjects with neuropathologic evidence of AD and concomitant brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> had poorer cognitive function and higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> than those with AD alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical and neuropsychologic manifestations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were studied in 74 subjects with neuropathologic findings of AD alone and 32 with AD and concomitant cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> or lacunar lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 32 patients with both AD and vascular lesions were significantly older at time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (median age, 81 years) than the 74 patients with AD alone (76 years; p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the final follow-up visit, the severity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was greater in AD patients with vascular lesions (median Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating [CDR] = 3) than in those with AD alone (CDR = 2; p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with AD and vascular lesions performed significantly worse on verbal fluency, Boston Naming, and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences between the groups were observed, however, in the semiquantitative measures of frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>neuritic plaques</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The clinical-neuropathologic correlations in CERAD patients generally confirm those in prior studies, indicating that the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in patients with AD is associated with greater overall severity of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and poorer performance on specific tests of language and cognitive function </plain></SENT>
