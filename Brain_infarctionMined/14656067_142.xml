<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the neuropathological changes in the brains of 39 longitudinally followed. cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly individuals (24 women, 15 men; age range 74-95, median 85 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neuropathological changes of the Alzheimer type were quantified by determining neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) staging by the method of Braak and Braak and by quantification of the abundance of diffuse, cored, and neuritic plaque burden using the scheme developed by the Consortium to Establish a Registry for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer Disease</z:hpo> (CERAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vascular, Lewy body, and argyrophilic grain pathology were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found 34 subjects (87%) with a Braak stage &lt;IV; 32 subjects (82%) with less than moderate numbers of cored plaques and 37 subjects (95%) with less than moderate numbers of tau-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>neuritic plaques</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many subjects had moderate or frequent diffuse plaques (n = 19, 49%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By the National Institute on Aging-Reagan Institute (NIA-RI) criteria, none of our cases met criteria for high "likelihood" of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four met NIA-RI criteria for intermediate "likelihood." Seven cases met CERAD criteria for possible AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nineteen met Khachaturian criteria for AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 1 subject had neocortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Small, old <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were common, but no subjects had more than 2 of these and none had a single large infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, the majority of individuals who are cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> near the time of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> have minimal amounts of tau-positive neuritic pathology (Braak stage &lt;IV and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>neuritic plaques</z:hpo> &lt;6 per x100 field in the most affected neocortical region) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The few subjects with more severe AD pathology can be expected based on incidence rates of AD in the very elderly </plain></SENT>
