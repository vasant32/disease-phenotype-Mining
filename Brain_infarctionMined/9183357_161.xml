<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to explore the pathophysiological significance of brain TNF-alpha in the ischemic brain by systematically evaluating the effects of lateral cerebroventricular administration of exogenous TNF-alpha and agents that block the effects of TNF-alpha on focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and by examining the potential direct toxic effects of TNF-alpha on cultured neurons to better understand how TNF-alpha might mediate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: TNF-alpha (2.5 or 25 pmol) was administered intracerebroventricularly to spontaneously hypertensive rats 24 hours before permanent or transient (80 minutes and 160 minutes) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were examined 24 hours later for neurological deficits and ischemic hemisphere <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In some of these studies, neutralizing anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody (mAb) (60 pmol) was injected intracerebroventricularly 30 minutes before exogenous TNF-alpha (25 pmol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the effects of blocking endogenous TNF-alpha on permanent focal ischemic injury were determined with the use of either mAb (60 pmol) or soluble TNF receptor I (sTNF-RI) (0.3 or 0.7 nmol) administered intracerebroventricularly 30 minutes before and 3 and 6 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, the direct neurotoxic effects of TNF-alpha were studied in cultured rat cerebellar granule cells exposed to TNF-alpha (10 to 2000 U/mL for 6 to 24 hours), and neurotransmitter release, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> toxicity, and oxygen radical toxicity were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TNF-alpha increased the percent hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> induced by permanent MCAO in a dose-related manner from 13.1 +/- 1.3% (vehicle) to 18.9 +/- 1.7% at 2.5 pmol (P &lt; .05) and 27.1 +/- 1.3% at 25 pmol (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The high dose of TNF-alpha increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced forelimb deficits from 1.6 +/- 0.2 to 2.3 +/- 0.2 (P &lt; 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha (2.5 pmol) also increased the infarction induced by 80 or 160 minutes of transient MCAO from 1.9 +/- 0.9% to 4.3 +/- 0.4% (P &lt; .01) and from 14.2 +/- 1.3% to 21.6 +/- 2.2% (P &lt; .05), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The exacerbation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, swelling, and neurological deficit after exogenous TNF-alpha was reversed by preinjection of 60 pmol mAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Blocking endogenous TNF-alpha also significantly reduced focal ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 60 pmol mAb before and after permanent MCAO significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size compared with control (nonimmune) antibody treatment by 20.2% (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> also was produced by brain administration of 0.3 nmol (decreased 18.2%) or 0.7 nmol (decreased 26.1%, P &lt; .05) sTNF-RI before and after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The intracerebroventricular administration of TNF-alpha or sTNF-RI did not alter brain or body temperature, blood gases or pH, blood pressure, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, or general blood chemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In cultured cerebellar granule cells, the application of TNF-alpha did not directly affect neurotransmitter release or <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> or oxygen free radical toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate that exogenous TNF-alpha exacerbates focal ischemic injury and that blocking endogenous TNF-alpha is neuroprotective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The specificity of the action(s) of TNF-alpha was demonstrated by antagonism of its effects with specific anti-TNF-alpha tools (ie, mAb and sTNF-RI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha toxicity does not appear to be due to a direct effect on neurons or modulation of neuronal sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> or oxygen radicals and apparently is mediated through nonneuronal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that inhibiting TNF-alpha may represent a novel pharmacological strategy to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
