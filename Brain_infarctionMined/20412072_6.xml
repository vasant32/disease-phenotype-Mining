<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Limited data on the brain penetration of potential <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatments have been cited as a major <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> contributing to numerous failed clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, we tested whether interleukin-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (IL-1RA), established as a potent inhibitor of brain injury in animals and currently in clinical development, reaches the brain via a clinically relevant administration route, in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Male, Sprague-Dawley rats [either naïve or exposed to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo)] were given a single s.c. dose of IL-1RA (100 mg*kg(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pharmacokinetic profile of IL-1RA was assessed in plasma and CSF up to 24 h post-administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain tissue distribution of administered IL-1RA was assessed using immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a separate experiment, the neuroprotective effect of the single s.c. dose of IL-1RA in MCAo was assessed versus a placebo control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: A single s.c. dose of IL-1RA reduced damage caused by MCAo by 33% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This dose resulted in sustained, high concentrations in plasma and CSF, penetrated brain tissue exclusively in areas of blood-brain barrier breakdown and co-localized with morphologically viable neurones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CSF concentrations did not reflect massive parenchymal infiltration of IL-1RA in MCAo animals compared to naïve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These data are the first to show that a potential treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, IL-1RA, rapidly reaches salvageable brain tissue via an administration route that is clinically relevant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This allows confidence that IL-1RA, as a candidate for further clinical development, is able to confer its protective actions both peripherally and centrally </plain></SENT>
