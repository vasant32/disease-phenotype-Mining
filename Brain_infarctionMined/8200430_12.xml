<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously found that fetal cortex taken from 16- to 18-day-old donors survives grafting to the infarcted cortex 5-7 days after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to examine the effect on graft survival of varying the age of the fetal donor tissue and the time between vessel occlusion and graft implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First, a cell suspension of neocortical tissue was grafted from fetuses aged 15, 17, or 20 gestational days to the infarcted cortex of hypertensive rats which had undergone <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> 5-7 days earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the mean size or general <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> assessed in Nissl- and acetylcholinesterase-stained sections between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Second, neocortical tissue was grafted from fetuses aged 15 gestational days to the infarcted cortex at different times following <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When surgery was delayed until 5-7 days, 3 weeks, or 8 weeks postocclusion, graft survival was significantly better than when implanted 1 day postocclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Implantation after 3 weeks yielded grafts that also were significantly larger than those in rats grafted 5-7 days after cortical infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that there is no crucial upper donor age limit for dissociated fetal neocortical grafts in terms of graft survival and volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a delay between lesion and transplantation is desirable in this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The host brain environment seems to be most hospitable around 3 weeks after <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
