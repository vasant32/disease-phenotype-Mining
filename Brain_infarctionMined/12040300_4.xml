<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous reports showed that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) frequently have coexisting vascular-related pathologies, such as cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the effects of subcortical lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on brain structure in patients with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Semi-automated tissue segmentation and volumetry of magnetic resonance imaging data were performed in 38 AD patients without lacunes (AD-L), 24 AD patients with subcortical lacunes (AD+L), and 40 age-matched cognitively healthy subjects without lacunes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following tissue volumes were quantified, expressed as percentage of total intracranial volume: ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), sulcal CSF, cortical gray matter (GM), subcortical GM, white matter (WM), white matter signal hyperintensities (WMSH), lacunes, and hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the Mini-Mental State Examination between the two AD groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AD+L patients compared with AD-L subjects had significantly greater volumes of WMSH and ventricular CSF spaces (as expected) but smaller sulcal CSF spaces and no significant increase in cortical GM <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (both unexpected) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the AD groups, ventricular CSF correlated inversely with cortical GM but not with WM; sulcal CSF correlated inversely with cortical GM and WM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive impairment</z:hpo> was associated with sulcal CSF volume but not with volumes of WMSH or lacunes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the presence of subcortical lacunes in those with AD is associated with more WM lesions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventriculomegaly</z:hpo> but not with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
