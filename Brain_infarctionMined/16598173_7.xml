<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> modulates the Bcl-2 family proteins in ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult female rats were ovariectomized and treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> prior to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brains were collected 24 hr after MCAO, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">Estradiol</z:chebi> significantly reduces the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and decreases the positive cells of TUNEL staining in cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In ischemic cerebral cortex, the level of Bcl-2 was decreased, and the level of Bax was significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">Estradiol</z:chebi> prevents the injury-induced decrease of Bcl-2 and increase of Bax </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> plays a potent protective role in brain injury through the regulation of Bcl-2 family proteins </plain></SENT>
