<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies indicate that ET(B) receptors may provide both vasodilatation and neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of selectively activating the ET(B) receptors following permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IRL-1620 [<z:chebi fb="9" ids="37952">Suc-</z:chebi>[Glu9,Ala11,15]-Endothelin-1(8-12)], a highly selective ET(B) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, was used alone and in conjunction with BQ788, an ET(B) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, to determine the role of ET(B) receptors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were assessed for neurological deficit and motor function, and their brains were evaluated to determine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> parameters, and ET receptor protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals treated with IRL-1620 showed significant improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> neurological and motor function tests when compared with both vehicle-treated and BQ788-treated middle cerebral artery occluded groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was a significant decrease in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume 24h after occlusion in animals treated with IRL-1620 (24.47±4.37mm(3)) versus the vehicle-treated group (153.23±32.18mm(3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blockade of ET(B) receptors by BQ788 followed by either vehicle or IRL-1620 treatment resulted in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes similar to those of rats treated with vehicle alone (163.51±25.41 and 139.21±15.20mm(3), respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, as measured by malondialdehyde, increased and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase and reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>) decreased following <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment with IRL-1620 reversed these effects, indicating that ET(B) receptor activation reduces <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> injury following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Animals pretreated with BQ788 showed similar <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> damage as those in the vehicle-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed in ET(B) receptor levels in any of the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrates that ET(B) receptor activation may be a novel neuroprotective therapy in the treatment of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
