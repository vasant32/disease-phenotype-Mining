<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although the concept of healthy ageing has stimulated considerable interest, no generally accepted definition has been developed nor has its biological basis been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To develop a definition of healthy ageing and investigate its association with longevity and neuropathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Analyses were based on cognitive, physical, and post-mortem assessments from 1991 to 1998 in the Nun Study, a longitudinal study of ageing in participants 75+ years at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We defined three mutually exclusive levels of healthy ageing (excellent, very good, and good) based on measures of global cognitive function, short-term memory, basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and self-rated function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mortality analyses were based on 636 participants; neuropathologic analyses were restricted to 221 who had died and were autopsied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only 11% of those meeting criteria for the excellent level of healthy ageing at baseline subsequently died, compared with 24% for the very good, 39% for the good, and 60% for the remaining participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival curves showed significantly greater longevity with higher levels of healthy ageing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk of not attaining healthy ageing, adjusted for age, increased two-fold in participants with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> alone, six-fold in those with Alzheimer neuropathology alone, and more than thirteen-fold in those with both brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and Alzheimer neuropathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The biological validity of our definition of healthy ageing is supported by its strong association with mortality and longevity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Avoiding Alzheimer and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> neuropathology is critical to the maintenance of healthy ageing, and the presence of both pathologies dramatically decreases the likelihood of healthy ageing </plain></SENT>
