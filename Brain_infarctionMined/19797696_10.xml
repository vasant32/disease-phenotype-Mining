<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is more sensitive to white matter damage than conventional MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship between DTI measures and gait has not been previously evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to investigate the relationship between the integrity of white matter in the corpus callosum as determined by DTI and quantitative measures of gait in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred seventy-three participants of a community-dwelling elderly cohort had neurological and neuropsychological examinations and brain MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gait function was measured by Tinetti gait (0 to 12), balance (0 to 16) and total (0 to 28) scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DTI assessed fractional anisotropy in the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conventional MRI was used to evaluate for brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and white matter hyperintensity volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>abnormal gait</z:hpo> had low fractional anisotropy in the genu of the corpus callosum but not the splenium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multiple regressions analyses showed an independent association between these genu abnormalities and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 Tinetti scores (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This association remained significant after adding MRI <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and white matter hyperintensity volume to the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The independent association between quantitative measures of gait function and DTI findings shows that white matter integrity in the genu of corpus callosum is an important marker of gait in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DTI analyses of white matter tracts in the brain and spinal cord may improve knowledge about the pathophysiology of gait impairment and help target clinical interventions </plain></SENT>
