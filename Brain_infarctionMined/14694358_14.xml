<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 10 polymorphisms were found: three in the promoter region, two in exons and five in introns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> polymorphisms were genotyped in ECTIM, a case-control study of MI (1815 subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The nonsynonymous 92Q allele was found in 1.8, 1.0 and 1.7% of controls from Strasbourg, Belfast and Glasgow - respectively; in cases: 4.2, 2.2 and 3.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The population-adjusted odds ratio (OR) for MI associated with allele Q carrying was 2.15 (95% CI: 1.09-4.23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To check its possible implication in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, this polymorphism was then genotyped in the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53712">AXA</z:chebi> Study (ultrasound examinations of carotid and femoral arteries in the context of an employment medical examination, 733 subjects), the EVA Study (ultrasound examinations of carotid arteries in a study of cognitive and vascular ageing, 1092 subjects) and the GENIC Study (on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (BI), 912 subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53712">AXA</z:chebi> Study, among smokers, carrying the 92Q allele was positively associated with the presence of a carotid plaque (OR 5.07; 95% CI: 1.64-15.63) and with a thickening of the carotid intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) (0.59 (0.11) vs 0.54 (0.11), P=0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the EVA Study, carriers of allele 92Q had an increased mean carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (0.70 (0.09) vs 0.67 (0.13), P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant association of the 92Q allele was found with BI in the GENIC Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, these results may suggest that carriers of the 92Q allele may be at increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
