<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, is also known as vascular permeability (VP) factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to investigate whether the inhibition of VEGF could reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> formation and cerebral venous infarction (CVI) in a rat 2-vein occlusion (2-VO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used 2-VO model in which 2 adjacent cortical veins were photochemically occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats (n=25) were divided into 2 groups: one group was treated with a VEGF <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> group, n=10) and the second group was treated with phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) (PBS group, n=15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VEGF <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> or PBS was injected intraperitoneally immediately after 2-VO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The developing ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histology 24 hours after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VEGF expression was observed in the cytoplasm of neurons exclusively in the area of vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> that was shown as a high-intensity area in the apparent diffusion coefficient of water map </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ischemic volumes calculated from each <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images, which are related to infarction and/or vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, respectively, were significantly smaller in the <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> group as compared with the PBS group (P&lt;0.05) CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to provide evidence that the inhibition of VEGF attenuates VP and reduces CVI in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although VEGF is a significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> factor, we concluded that the inhibition of VEGF might be a new therapy for both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> formation and CVI </plain></SENT>
