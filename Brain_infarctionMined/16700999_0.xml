<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (ABI) and human leukocyte antigen DR (HLA-DR) gene at molecular level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: By using polymerase chain reaction sequence specific probe (PCR-SSP), gene special position of the HLA-II DR alleles were determined in 31 patients and 30 healthy individuals as controls, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them were inhabitants of Northeastern China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The HLA-DR B1*0301 gene frequency in the group of ABI was obviously higher than that of control group (RR=5.6842, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The HLA-DR B1*0301 gene may be the susceptible gene of ABI in Northeastern China, or it may associate with other genes to produce the disease </plain></SENT>
