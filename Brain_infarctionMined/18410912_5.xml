<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) protected neurons from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in vivo following focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to develop an in vitro rat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model to examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the neuroprotective effects of NRG-1 on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rat B-35 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cells differentiated by serum withdrawal, developed enhanced neuronal characteristics including, neurite extension and upregulation of neuronal markers of differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When B35 neurons were subjected to oxygen <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD)/reoxygenation or <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, widespread neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was seen after both treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with NRG-1 immediately after OGD significantly increased neuronal survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NRG-1 administration also resulted in a significant decrease in annexin V, an early marker of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the neurotoxic actions of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> were unaffected by NRG-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effects of NRG-1 were prevented by an inhibitor of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results provide a new model to gain insight into the mechanisms employed by NRG-1 to protect neurons from ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
