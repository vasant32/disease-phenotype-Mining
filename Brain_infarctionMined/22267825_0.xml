<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with both symptomatic and silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (SBI) has only been investigated in patients with cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the European <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial Fibrillation</z:hpo> Trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed whether patients with recent noncardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and SBI detected on MRI are at increased risk for recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, other cardiovascular events, and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The prevalence of SBI detected on MRI was assessed in 1014 patients enrolled in the imaging substudy of the Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Strokes</z:hpo> (PRoFESS) trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was first recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with both symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and SBI in comparison with age- and sex-matched patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> without SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes were a combined vascular end point, other vascular events, and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 2 groups were compared using conditional logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was detected in 207 (20.4%) of the 1014 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven (13.0%) patients with SBI and 19 (9.2%) without SBI had a recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.79-2.56; P=0.24) during a mean follow-up of 2.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> secondary outcome parameters between patients with SBI and matched patients without SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of SBI in patients with recent mild noncardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> could not be shown to be an independent risk factor for recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, other vascular events, or a higher mortality rate </plain></SENT>
