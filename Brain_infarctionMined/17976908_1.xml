<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In previous studies, we have shown that cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> results in increased activity of caspase-9, the initiator caspase, and caspase-3, in the cytosolic fraction of the cerebral cortex of newborn piglets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study examines the mechanism of caspase-9 activation during <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and tests the hypothesis that the ATP and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>-dependent activation of caspase-9 increases in the cytosol of the cerebral cortex of newborn piglets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Newborn piglets were divided into normoxic (Nx, n=4), and hypoxic (Hx, n=4) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anesthetized, ventilated animals were exposed to an FiO(2) of 0.21 (Nx) or 0.07 (Hx) for 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> was documented biochemically by determining levels of ATP and phosphocreatine (PCr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytosolic fraction was isolated and passed through a G25-Sephadex column to remove endogenous ATP and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fractions were collected and protein determined by UV spectrophotometry at 280 nm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eluted high-molecular weight samples from normoxic and hypoxic animals were divided into four subgroups: subgroup 1 (control), incubated without added ATP and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>; subgroup 2, incubated with added ATP; subgroup 3, incubated with added <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>; and subgroup 4, incubated with added ATP and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incubation was carried out at 37 degrees C for 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following incubation, the protein was separated by 12% <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE and active caspase-9 was detected using specific active caspase-9 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Protein density was determined by imaging densitometry and expressed as absorbance (OD x mm(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ATP (mumol/g brain) level was 4.7 +/- 0.18 in normoxic, as compared to 1.53 +/- 0.16 in hypoxic (p &lt; 0.05 vs. Nx) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>PCr (mumol/g brain) level was 4.03 +/- 0.11 in the normoxic and 1.1 +/- 0.3 in the hypoxic brain (p &lt; 0.05 vs. Nx) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the normoxic preparations, active caspase-9 density increased by 9, 4 and 20% in the presence of ATP, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> and ATP+<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the hypoxic preparations, active caspase-9 density increased by 30, 45 and 60% in the presence of ATP, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> and ATP+<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These results show that incubation with ATP, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> and ATP+<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> result in a significantly increased activation of caspase-9 in the hypoxic group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the ATP and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> dependent activation of caspase-9 is increased during <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>We propose that the ATP and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> sites of apoptotic protease activating factor I that mediate caspase-9 activation are modified during <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
