<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical presentation and aetiology of small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarctions</z:e> as found on diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DWI is both sensitive and specific in the early detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> irrespective of pre-existing vascular damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety three patients were identified showing subcortical or brainstem DWI lesions &lt;1.5 cm in diameter within a maximum of 7 days from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients' clinical status on admission was reviewed according to the Oxfordshire Community <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Project (OCSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of procedures searching for cerebrovascular risk factors, large artery disease, and potential sources of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e> were included to determine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging scans were also reviewed for concomitant changes that could support the aetiologic classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only 41 (44.1%) patients presented clinically with a lacunar syndrome according to OCSP criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The nine (9.7%) patients who showed two or more DWI lesions in different vascular territories were also significantly more likely to have potential sources of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e> (5/9, 55.6% v 20/84, 23.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was significantly more prevalent in the group of patients who showed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> related imaging pattern, but this pattern did not exclude the presence of large artery disease or a possible cardioembolic source of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Identification of small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarctions</z:e> as the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> appears quite uncertain based on clinical characteristics only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DWI adds significant aetiologic information but does not obviate the search for other potentially causative mechanisms </plain></SENT>
