<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A growing body of evidence points out the potential role of inflammatory mechanisms in the pathophysiology of ischaemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients display an intrathecal production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1beta and IL-6 already within the first 24 h after the beginning of symptoms (Tarkowski et al., 1995) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate patterns of local <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> as a consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were studied prospectively on days 0-3, 7-9, 21-26 and after day 90 with clinical evaluations, radiological assessments and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokine levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, 15 healthy control CSF samples were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significantly increased CSF levels of IL-8, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-10 were observed early during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with a peak on day 2 for the proinflammatory cytokines IL-8 and GM-CSF, and on day 3 for the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with a brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> predominantly located in the white matter showed significantly higher levels of IL-8 in CSF than patients with an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> mainly located in the grey matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, high levels of intrathecal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were associated with the presence of white matter disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrates an intrathecal production of proinflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, supporting the notion of localized immune response to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may lead to new treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
