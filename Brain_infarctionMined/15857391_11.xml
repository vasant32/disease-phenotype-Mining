<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in C57BL/6 female mice after MCAO and reperfusion was significantly smaller than that in male mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intraperitoneal injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> after the start of reperfusion significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the male mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, no significant gender difference was found in total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in gamma protein kinase C (PKC)-knockout mice, suggesting that the neuroprotective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> are due to the activation of a specific subtype of PKC, gammaPKC, a neuron-specific PKC subtype, in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that exogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-induced neuroprotection was attenuated in gammaPKC-knockout mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemical study showed that gammaPKC was translocated to nerve fiber-like structures when observed shortly after MCAO and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also visualized the rapid and reversible translocation of gammaPKC-GFP (green fluorescent protein) by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> stimulation in living <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>-K1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the activation of gammaPKC through the G-protein-coupled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptors on the plasma membrane is involved in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-induced neuroprotection against focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
