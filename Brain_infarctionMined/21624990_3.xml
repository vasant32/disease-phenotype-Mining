<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although several studies reported silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> on neuroimaging in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>migraine with aura</z:hpo>, knowledge about lesion patterns in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112466" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">migrainous infarction</z:e> is scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated clinical and MRI characteristics in a series of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventeen patients among 8,137 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients over an 11-year period were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had undergone a dedicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> workup including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and a detailed assessment of clinical features and of vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The majority of patients presented with prolonged aura symptoms (visual aura 82.3%, sensory dysfunction 41.2%, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> 5.9%; median NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Presentation at hospital was significantly delayed after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (mean 33 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 70.6% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesions in the posterior circulation; the middle cerebral artery territory was affected in 29.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Small lesions were present in 64.7%; multiple lesions were found in 41.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No overlapping ischemic lesions of different vascular territories were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> was high (64.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study supports previous observations that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112466" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">migrainous infarction</z:e> mostly occurs in the posterior circulation, and in younger women with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>migraine with aura</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesions were often multiple and located in distinct arterial territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>As there were no overlapping ischemic lesions, hemodynamic compromise during the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> is unlikely the cause of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Differentiation between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112466" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">migrainous infarction</z:e> and prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> aura is difficult and associated with delayed admission of patients </plain></SENT>
