<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The RBC aggregation index was found to increase by about 80 per cent in both the cerebral and systemic circulation as compared to the control blood samples </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of this study suggest a certain interdependence between the blood plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and the RBC aggregation in the brain vessels following its damage </plain></SENT>
