<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data about characteristics and etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during sleep are conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association of the activity at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> during night sleep vs. <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> while awake) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes of different etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 1448 patients with first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with known time of symptom presentation were prospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical comparisons were performed between patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during sleep and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> while awake in terms of demographic features, known risk factors, vascular comorbidities, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple variable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictor variables (including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> during sleep was documented in 264 cases (18.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during sleep, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> was the most prevalent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype (39%), while in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> while awake, small-vessel disease was the underlying mechanism significantly (P &lt; .001) less often (13.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> while awake suffered significantly (P &lt; .001) more frequently from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (18.2%) and cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (34.9%) when compared with subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during sleep (6.4% and 18.9%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The multiple variable logistic regression model identified the following factors as independent predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during sleep: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (odds ratio: 0.346, 95% confidence interval: 0.237-0.505, P &lt; .001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> versus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (odds ratio: 0.238, 95% confidence interval: 0.138-0.410, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lacunar infarction</z:e> was the only <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> subgroup that was positively associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during sleep (odds ratio: 2.568, 95% confidence interval: 1.447-4.560, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during sleep and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> while awake concerning vascular risk profile and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> etiologic subtypes </plain></SENT>
