<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>-regulating agent acadesine has been shown to reduce the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study examined the effect of acadesine on the accumulation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">indium</z:chebi>-labeled platelet emboli and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size after photothrombosis of the common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> and preloaded with 111In-tropolone-labeled platelets (50 to 80 microCi) 30 minutes before nonocclusive common carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> induced by a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi>-mediated photochemical insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intravenous infusion of acadesine (0.5, 1, or 2 mg/kg per minute) or vehicle was begun 30 minutes before right common carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and continued for an additional 15 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were then killed and brains processed for the autoradiographic quantitation of labeled platelet aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a separate group of rats, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas and volumes were determined in treated (acadesine 1 mg/kg per minute) (n = 9) and nontreated (n = 9) rats 7 days after <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although the ratio of right-to-left common carotid artery radioactivity was not affected by treatment, acadesine at 1 and 2 mg/kg per minute significantly decreased (P &lt; .01) platelet deposition within the right cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For example, within the frontoparietal cortex, numbers of platelet aggregates were 11.8 +/- 1.8 (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>), 6.1 +/- 1.4, 2.3 +/- 0.6, and 3.2 +/- 0.8 in rats infused with vehicle, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/kg per minute acadesine, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was reduced by 48% in acadesine-treated (1 mg/kg per minute) rats, with a significant reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area at the coronal level 3.7 mm anterior to bregma (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results support a prophylactic role for acadesine in reducing the accumulation of platelet emboli during vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Acadesine treatment in patients at risk for embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> could potentially lead to cerebral protection </plain></SENT>
