<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the independent association between physical activity and subclinical cerebrovascular disease as measured by silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (SBI) and white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Northern Manhattan Study (NOMAS) is a population-based prospective cohort examining risk factors for incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, and a subsample underwent brain MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our primary outcomes were SBI and WMHV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline measures of leisure-time physical activity were collected in person </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Physical activity was categorized by quartiles of the metabolic equivalent (MET) score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used logistic regression models to examine the associations between physical activity and SBI, and linear regression to examine the association with WMHV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 1,238 clinically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free participants (mean age 70 Â± 9 years) of whom 60% were women, 65% were Hispanic, and 43% reported no physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 197 (16%) participants had SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In fully adjusted models, compared to those who did not engage in physical activity, those in the upper quartile of MET scores were almost half as likely to have SBI (adjusted odds ratio 0.6, 95% confidence interval 0.4-0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Physical activity was not associated with WMHV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of physical activity were associated with a lower risk of SBI but not WMHV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Engaging in moderate to heavy physical activities may be an important component of prevention strategies aimed at reducing subclinical brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
