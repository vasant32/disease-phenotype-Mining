<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the frequency, location, and extent of symptomatic and asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in autopsy specimens from elderly patients with NRAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined autopsy specimens from 136 consecutive NRAF patients 70 years of age or older who received no <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy during their lifetime and compared them with 231 age-matched control subjects with similar health histories except for the absence of NRAF </plain></SENT>
