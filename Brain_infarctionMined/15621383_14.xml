<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The respective roles of the ventral posterior complex (VP) and of the more recently described VMpo (posterior part of the ventral medial nucleus) as thalamic relays for pain and temperature pathways have recently been the subject of controversy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data we obtained in one patient after a limited left thalamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> bring some new insights into this debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This patient presented sudden right-sided hypesthesia for both lemniscal (touch, vibration, joint position) and spinothalamic (pain and temperature) modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He subsequently developed right-sided central pain with <z:mp ids='MP_0003177'>allodynia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Projection of 3D magnetic resonance images onto a human thalamic atlas revealed a lesion involving the anterior two thirds of the ventral posterior lateral nucleus (VPL) and, to a lesser extent, the ventral posterior medial (VPM) and inferior (VPI) nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the lesion did not extend posterior and ventral enough to concern the putative location of the spinothalamic-afferented nucleus VMpo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurophysiological studies showed a marked reduction (67%) of cortical responses depending on dorsal column-lemniscal transmission, while spinothalamic-specific, <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi>-laser induced cortical responses were only moderately attenuated (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results show that the VP is definitely involved in thermo-algesic transmission in man, and that its selective lesion can lead to central pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, results also suggest that much of the spino-thalamo-cortical volley elicited by painful heat stimuli does not transit through VP, supporting the hypothesis that a non-VP locus lying more posteriorly in the human thalamus is important for thermo-algesic transmission </plain></SENT>
