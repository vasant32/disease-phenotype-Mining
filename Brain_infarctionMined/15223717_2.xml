<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Because of current limitations in improving metabolic support to the brain during hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e>), attenuation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury remains an area of therapeutic intervention of relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Apotransferrin (Apo-Tf), alpha 1-acid <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (AGP), and C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) have been herein evaluated as potential beneficial agents in reducing the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury in a surviving model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Apo-Tf 100 mg/kg (n = 6), C1-INH 50 IU/kg (n = 6), AGP 100 mg/kg (n = 6), or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> 0.9% 2 ml/kg (n = 6) were randomly administered to 24 juvenile pigs after a 75-min period <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> at a brain temperature of 18 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Animals in the Apo-Tf group had a slightly better 7-day survival (66.7%) compared with the other study groups (50%), but such a difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some favorable changes in the brain <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism parameters were observed in the AGP, C1-INH, and Apo-Tf groups, but these did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Semiquantitative analysis of the histopathological findings did not show any significant difference between the study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, only two out of four surviving animals in the Apo-Tf group developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three survivors of the remaining study groups developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the small size of the study groups may affect the present findings, none of the metabolic and hemodynamic parameters as well as outcome endpoints indicate a substantial therapeutic efficacy of Apo-Tf, AGP, and C1-INH as neuroprotective agents after experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
