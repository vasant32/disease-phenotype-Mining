<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five patients had numerous periventricular and deep white-matter lesions, probably due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ischemic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging was performed 4-30 days after the ictus, preceded by computed tomography (CT) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In most cases, the nonenhanced spin-echo (SE) images, obtained at 500-msec repetition times and 30-msec echo times, failed to demonstrate the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, and in general the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-enhanced SE 500/30 images matched the contrast material-enhanced CT scans in pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Periventricular lesions and small, deep, white-matter <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> that were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and asymptomatic were not enhanced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, three small, symptomatic capsular and brain-stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> showed definite enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Usually the enhancement was visible at 3 minutes, increasing to a peak at 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 55 minutes, the enhancement increased in the medium-aged <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (8-14 days), while it decreased in the late <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (15-30 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The T2 relaxation time-weighted pulse sequences were most sensitive for demonstrating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, but without the aid of a contrast agent, they were frequently poor in specificity </plain></SENT>
