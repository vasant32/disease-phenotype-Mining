<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To longitudinally investigate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats after photothrombotic occlusion of proximal middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in correlation with histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two rats were subjected to photochemical <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and MRI at 1.5T, and sacrificed in seven groups (n=6 each) at the following time points: 1, 3, 6 and 12h, and at day 1, 3 and 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T2-weighted (T2WI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) map was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (CE-T1WI) was compared to intravital staining with Evans blue in one group for assessing blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The brain was stained histochemically with triphenyl tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) and processed for pathological assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The evolutional changes of relative lesion volume, signal intensity (SI), and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> integrity on MRI with corresponding histopathology were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ischemic lesion volume reached a maximum around 12h to day 1 as visualized successively by DWI, <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> map and T2WI, implicating the evolving pathology from cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> through vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> to tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> underwent a significant reversion after 12h, reflecting the colliquative <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On CE-T1WI, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> leakage peaked at 6h and at day 3 with a transitional partial recovery around 24h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume on T2WI, DWI and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> map matched well with that on TTC staining at 12h and at day 1 (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The evolution of the present photothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model in rats could be characterized by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The obtained information may help longitudinal studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> agents using the same model </plain></SENT>
