<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Single cases with hemispheric, cortical or subcortical, ischemic lesions presenting with rotational <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> (RV), that challenge the notion of infratentorial or peripheral generation of RV have been published, but the incidence of this symptom in a larger series is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hemispheric cerebrovascular lesions cause vertiginous sensations with particular emphasis on RV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 112 consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were assessed in a prospective single-center study over a 22-month inclusion period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rotational or other vertiginous sensations were assessed using a structured 5-item questionnaire and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> were further evaluated with Yardley's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>Vertigo</z:hpo> Symptom Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects underwent standard clinical neuro-ophthalmological and neuro-otological testing and data were correlated to imaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RV was absent among our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Few subjects reported non-rotational vertiginous sensations with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These were mainly right-hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> with concomitant subcortical leukoaraiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this case series we did not find any patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001411'>spinning</z:mp> sensations which is supportive of the dogma that supratenotrial lesions do not cause RV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Certain hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patterns, however, may be related to non-rotational dizziness </plain></SENT>
