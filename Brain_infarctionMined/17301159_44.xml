<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of MMP-9 in the immature brain after <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (HI) is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We exposed MMP-9(-/-) [MMP-9 knock-out (KO)] and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) mice to HI on postnatal day 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HI was induced by unilateral ligation of the left carotid artery followed by <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (10% O2; 36 degrees C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gelatin zymography showed that MMP-9 activity was transiently increased at 24 h after HI in the ipsilateral hemisphere and MMP-9-positive cells were colocalized with activated microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven days after 50 min of HI, cerebral tissue volume loss was reduced in MMP-9 KO (21.8 +/- 1.7 mm3; n = 22) compared with WT (32.3 +/- 2.1 mm3; n = 22; p &lt; 0.001) pups, and loss of white-matter components was reduced in MMP-9 KO compared with WT pups (neurofilament: WT, 50.9 +/- 5.4%; KO, 18.4 +/- 3.1%; p &lt; 0.0001; myelin basic protein: WT, 57.5 +/- 5.8%; KO, 23.2 +/- 3.5%; p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neuropathological changes were associated with a delayed and diminished leakage of the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) and a decrease in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in MMP-9-deficient animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the neuroprotective effects after HI in MMP-9-deficient animals were not linked to either caspase-dependent (caspase-3 and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>) or caspase-independent (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing factor) processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that excessive activation of MMP-9 is deleterious to the immature brain, which is associated with the degree of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> leakage and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> does not appear to be a major contributing factor </plain></SENT>
