<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">Iodine</z:chebi>-125 Iomazenil and 99mTc-HMPAO was used to label BZR and rCBF respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase of infarction 21 to 28 days after occlusion (5 rats), rCBF in the left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory was decreased to 62% of the sham control (4 rats), while BZR was more decreased to 45% of the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In remote areas from the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> lesion, the ipsilateral thalamus showed 28% decrease of BZR as compared to the control, though the decrease of rCBF was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Iomazenil distribution may represent neuron density or BZR density on a neuron, since central type BZR is reported to be located on neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that central type BZR imaging is more useful tool for the evaluation of brain tissue viability and transneuronal degeneration than rCBF imaging in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
