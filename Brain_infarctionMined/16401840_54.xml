<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Microvascular brain injury, typically measured by extent of white matter hyperintensity (WMH) on MRI, is an important contributor to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest a role for circulating beta-amyloid <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in microvascular dysfunction and white matter disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors performed a cross-sectional study of clinical, biochemical, and genetic factors associated with WMH in 54 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) or mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (AD/MCI) and an independent group of 42 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> (CAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Extent of WMH was determined by computer-assisted volumetric measurement normalized to intracranial size (nWMH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biochemical measurements included plasma concentrations of the 40- and 42-amino acid species of beta-amyloid (Abeta40 and Abeta42) detected by specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma Abeta40 concentrations were associated with nWMH in both groups (correlation coefficient = 0.48 in AD/MCI, 0.42 in CAA, p &lt; or = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma Abeta40 remained independently associated with nWMH after adjustment for potential confounders among age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi>, and APOE genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> was also associated with increased Abeta40 in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>nWMH was greater in CAA (19.8 cm3) than AD (11.1 cm3) or MCI (10.0 cm3; p &lt; 0.05 for both comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Plasma beta-amyloid 40 concentration is independently associated with extent of white matter hyperintensity in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If confirmed in longitudinal studies, these data would suggest circulating beta-amyloid <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> as a novel biomarker or risk factor for microvascular damage in these common diseases of the elderly </plain></SENT>
