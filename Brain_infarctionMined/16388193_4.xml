<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is well known that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that specific, marked <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> of cerebral arteries is present in patients with lacunar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cerebrovascular reactivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi>, which reveals the function of the cerebral endothelium, was investigated in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> (20 patients, 11 male and 9 female, aged 60.9 +/- 7.3 years), 21 age- and gender-matched asymptomatic patients with similar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>) and 21 age- and gender-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean arterial velocity (vm) in both middle cerebral arteries was measured by transcranial Doppler sonography during a 15-min baseline period, a 30-min intravenous infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> and a 15-min interval after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Arterial blood pressure, heart rate and <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> were measured continuously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The measured vm increase during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> infusion in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> (13.4 +/- 9.1%) was significantly lower compared to the healthy controls (20.5 +/- 9.9%) but similar to that obtained in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> (11.5 +/- 8.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that cerebrovascular reactivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi>, which demonstrates cerebral endothelial function, is significantly impaired in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we found that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> do not show any additional impairment of cerebral endothelial function </plain></SENT>
