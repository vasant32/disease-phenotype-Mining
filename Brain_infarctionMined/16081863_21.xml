<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the prospective association of alcohol consumption and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> among 4410 participants free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> at baseline in the Cardiovascular Health Study, a population-based cohort study of older adults from 4 US communities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants reported their consumption of alcoholic beverages yearly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During an average follow-up period of 9.2 years, 434 cases of incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with long-term abstainers, the multivariate relative risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were 0.85 (95% CI, 0.63 to 1.13), 0.75 (95% CI, 0.53 to 1.06), 0.82 (95% CI, 0.51 to 1.30), and 1.03 (95% CI, 0.68 to 1.57) among consumers of &lt;1, 1 to 6, 7 to 13, and &gt; or =14 drinks per week (P quadratic trend 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ApoE genotype appeared to modify the alcohol-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> relationship (P interaction 0.08), with generally lower risks among drinkers than abstainers in apoE4-negative participants but higher risks among drinkers than abstainers among apoE4-positive participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We could not identify candidate mediators among <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>, inflammatory, and prothrombotic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study of older adults, the association of alcohol use and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was U-shaped, with modestly lower risk among consumers of 1 to 6 drinks per week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, apoE genotype may modify this association, and even moderate alcohol intake may be associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> among apoE4-positive older adults </plain></SENT>
