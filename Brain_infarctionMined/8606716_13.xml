<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether atherosclerotic plaques in the aortic arch are a risk factor for recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and for vascular events in general (i.e., <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, peripheral embolism, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from vascular causes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For a period of two to four years, we followed a cohort of 331 patients 60 years of age or older who were consecutively admitted to the hospital with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (a total of 788 person-years of follow up) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent transesophageal echocardiography to determine whether atherosclerotic plaques were present in the aortic arch proximal to the ostium of the left subclavian artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into three groups according to the thickness of the wall of the aortic arch ( &lt; 1 mm, 1 to 3.9 mm, and &gt; or = 4 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was 11.9 per 100 person-years in patients with an aortic-wall thickness of &gt; or = 4 mm, as compared with 3.5 per 100 person-years in patients with a wall thickness of 1 to 3.9 mm and 2.8 per 100 person-years in patients with a wall thickness of &lt; 1 mm (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of vascular events was 26.0, 9.1, and 5.9 per 100 person-years of follow-up in the respective groups (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo>, and other risk factors, aortic plaques &gt; or = 4 mm thick (including the thickness of the aortic wall) were found to be independent predictors of recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (relative risk, 3.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.8 to 7.8; P = 0.0012) and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> vascular events (relative risk, 3.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.1 to 5.9; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Atherosclerotic plaques &gt; or = 4 mm thick in the aortic arch are significant predictors of recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and other vascular events </plain></SENT>
