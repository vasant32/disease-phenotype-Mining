<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether clinical presentations and risk factor profiles differ between periventricular venous infarction (PVI) and arterial presumed perinatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (APPIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: A total of 59 children with presumed perinatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (PPIS) from the SickKids Children's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Program who were carried to term (63% boys) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Single tertiary care center subspecialty program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Participants had validated magnetic resonance imaging classification to define PVI and APPIS subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical presentations, times to parental and physician concern, age at diagnosis, and standardized risk factor evaluations including maternal, fetal, obstetrical, neonatal, and prothrombotic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with PVI and APPIS were compared using chi(2) or Fisher exact tests and Wilcoxon rank sum or Mann-Whitney U tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 12 children (20%) had PVI and 47 (80%) had APPIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median parental concern was 5 months, with delays to physician concern (7 months) and diagnosis (12 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Delays were longer in PVI cases compared with APPIS (P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most presented with asymmetrical motor development but children with APPIS were more likely to present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> or nonmotor delays (P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Children with APPIS were more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> perinatal risk factors (66% vs 17%; P = .002) including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015930" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal distress</z:e>, emergency <z:hpo ids='HP_0011410'>caesarian section</z:hpo>, or neonatal resuscitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cardiac evaluations were unremarkable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Prothrombotic abnormalities were common (44%) including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, and elevated factor IX but were comparable between APPIS and PVI subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of PPIS is often delayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> perinatal risk factors with APPIS compared with PVI supports distinct timing of these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Prospective, case-control risk factor studies of PPIS subtypes are required to develop prevention strategies </plain></SENT>
