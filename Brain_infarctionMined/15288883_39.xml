<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the association between the alpha-adrenergic morning surge in BP and silent cerebrovascular disease in elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted ambulatory BP monitoring three times (twice at baseline and after nighttime dosing of the alpha1-blocker <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4708">doxazosin</z:chebi>) in 98 elderly hypertensive patients in whom the presence of silent cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (SCI) was assessed by brain magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The morning BP surge (MBPS) was calculated as the mean systolic BP during the 2 h after waking minus the mean systolic BP during 1 h that included the lowest sleep BP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The alpha-adrenergic MBPS was calculated as the reduction of MBPS by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4708">doxazosin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of multiple SCI was higher in the Surge group (top quartile: MBPS &gt; or = 45 mm Hg, n = 24) than in the Nonsurge group (MBPS &lt; 45 mm Hg, n = 74) (54% v 31%, P = .04), and in the higher alpha-adrenergic surge group (top quartile: alpha-adrenergic MBPS &gt; or = 28 mm Hg, n = 25) than in the lower alpha-adrenergic surge group (&lt; 28 mm Hg, n = 73) (68% v 26%, P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the Surge group, subjects with higher alpha-adrenergic surge (n = 17) had a markedly higher frequency of multiple SCI, whereas none in the lower alpha-adrenergic surge group had multiple SCI (n = 7) (77% v 0%, P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The alpha-adrenergic MBPS was closely associated with multiple SCI (10 mm Hg increase: OR = 1.96, P = .006), independently of age, MBPS, 24-h systolic BP, and other confounding factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The morning BP surge, particularly that dependent on alpha-adrenergic activity, is closely associated with advanced silent hypertensive cerebrovascular disease in elderly individuals </plain></SENT>
