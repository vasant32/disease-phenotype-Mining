<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Operative technique of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We adopted the strategy to replace the aortic arch only when the entry of the dissection was found in the aortic arch, or atherosclerotic arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> existed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the current study was to elucidate the feasibility of the ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement and to follow the fate of the patent false lumen distal to the anastomosis after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients operated from 2000 to 2004 were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ascending or hemiarch replacement were performed in 15/19 (78.9%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The early mortality rate was 10.5% (2/19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> included major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and rupture of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004954'>descending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> 25 +/- 23 days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thrombosed distal false lumen of the thoracic aorta was observed in 60% (9/15) of patients of De Bakey type I dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus our strategy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> including entry closure and the ascending or hemiarch replacement is a reasonable option especially for the elderly patients in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results also indicated that the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the false lumen distal to the anastomosis can be expected and the enlargement of the distal aorta is minimal </plain></SENT>
