<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study quantitatively describes differences between participants with hemiparetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and age-matched healthy participants in axial body segment and gait kinematics during a direction change task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Participants were required to change walking direction by 45 degrees, either to their left or right, at the midpoint of a 6-m path </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were visually cued either at the start of the walk (pre-planned) or one stride before they reached the turn point (reactive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sequence and inter-segmental timing of axial orientation <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was preserved in participants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of a subgroup of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> survivors indicated that participants with lesions affecting the basal ganglia (BG) took significantly longer time than control participants to initiate the reorientation synergy when making turns to their non-paretic side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that these differences are a product of asymmetrical activity of dopaminergic pathways in the brain resulting from compromised BG function </plain></SENT>
