<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We were especially interested in the conditions of the extracranial vessels such as the carotid arteries and the murmurs at this point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number of arterial stenoses in this region, ascertained in younger people is similar in old age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Besides of others factors, caused by old age, the many cases of multiple extracranial stenoses are probably responsible for the overproportional big <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In nearly 50% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stenoses we heard vascular murmurs, mostly in both of the carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite of some uncertainly of the clinical importance - just in old age many <z:mp ids='MP_0006114'>cardiac murmurs</z:mp> of the ejection type with tendency to transmission have been heard - they should give rise to investigate carefully the region of the neck in symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
