<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To better understand the mechanisms behind <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> in muscles affected by a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Patients recruited by convenience compared to age-matched healthy subjects from a population study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University hospital laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Repetitive eccentric-concentric plantar flexions at 60 degrees/sec were performed on a dynamometer until exhaustion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean power frequency and root mean square of the electromyogram were recorded, and work was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Both legs of seven patients with upper motor neuron lesion from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and one leg of healthy men were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant (p &gt; .05) differences in number of cycles performed or decrease of work between any of the tested legs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant (p &gt; .05) difference in work performed by the affected leg and the reference group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean power frequency decreased significantly (p &gt; .05) for the gastrocnemius muscle in the nonaffected leg and for the reference group, while no such decreases were found in the affected leg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The statistical methods used were the nonparametric tests: the Wilcoxon one-sample for differences between paired observations, and the Mann-Whitney U for differences between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A reduction in work in high-intensity dynamic muscle activity may not be associated with a reduction in mean power frequency, especially in patients with altered supraspinal control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There may be peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> factors not reflected in the electromyographic activity </plain></SENT>
