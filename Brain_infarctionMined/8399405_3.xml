<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Graded Neurologic Scale and Mattis <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating Scale were used to assess neurologic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> within the first week, 3 weeks and 6 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CT was performed at each examination and semiquantitative measurements of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one percent of patients were found to be cognitively impaired within the first week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 6 months this deficit had resolved in 24%, but was still present in 37% of individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Initial findings associated with a high risk of long-term intellectual dysfunction were: 1. moderately severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, 2. diminished alertness in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> stage, 3. infarction involving the temporal lobe, 4. evidence of multiple brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and 5. pronounced ventricular enlargement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis revealed temporal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and evidence of multiple ischemic lesions as the most powerful predictors of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By these two factors alone, 85.4% of study participants could be correctly classified regarding their cognitive outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> to be a frequent sequela of supratentorial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
