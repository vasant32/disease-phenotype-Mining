<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Delayed ischemic postconditioning (Post C), which involves a brief <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> followed by reperfusion 2 days after 8-10min global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (GCI), has been shown to exert a remarkable protection of the vulnerable hippocampal CA1 region of the brain and attenuation of behavioral deficits, although the mechanisms remain poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the current study was to explore the effect of Post C upon <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> integrity, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release and Bax translocation as a potential key mechanism for Post C protection of the critical hippocampal CA1 region neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results of the study revealed that ischemic Post C (3min) administered 2 days after 8-min GCI exerted a robust preservation from GCI injury, as evidenced by the increase of NeuN-positive and the decrease of TUNEL-positive cells, as well as morphological features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> integrity in the hippocampal CA1 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also found that Post C significantly blocked inner <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential depolarization, as shown by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52097">JC-1</z:chebi> staining, and attenuates <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release and Bax translocation induced by GCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre-treatment of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, 20min prior to Post C, significantly attenuated Post C-induced elevation of p-Akt and p-GSK3β, as well as prevented Post C enhancement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> integrity and Post C neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that phosphorylation of Akt and subsequent inactivation of GSK3β signaling is critical in mediating Post C beneficial effects upon <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> integrity, function and neuroprotection following GCI injury </plain></SENT>
