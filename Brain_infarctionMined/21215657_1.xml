<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> at 60 mg/day for 14 days was administered to patients admitted 12-24 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> group; n = 29) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Venous blood samples were obtained on admission and at 48 hours, 7 days, and 14 days after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum concentrations of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-18, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor α, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and MMP-9 were measured </plain></SENT>
