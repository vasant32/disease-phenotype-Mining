<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The brain tissue reduction, assessed by measuring the cross-sectional area of remaining tissue and weight of the cerebral hemispheres, was greater in SHR than in WKY (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Deficits in sensorimotor integration were highly correlated to the degree of brain damage (r = 0.91) </plain></SENT>
