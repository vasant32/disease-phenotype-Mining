<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate part of the immune response in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and to analyze a possible correlation with other hematological parameters, clinical outcome, size of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We prospectively studied 42 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, without signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e>, at days 0, 1, 3, 7 and 14, and 39 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured serum levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) and the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) by ELISA method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed a highly inverse correlation between these two molecules in control subjects (r=-0.78, p=0.0000001), and this correlation was lost in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients had significantly lowered IL-10 serum levels soon after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> event (p=0.00005), with a slight increase at the seventh day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, patients had increased IL-6 serum levels compared with controls after day one until day 14 (p&lt;0.04), with a maximum increase at day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-6 correlated with clinical outcome whereas interleukin-10 did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low levels of interleukin-10 indicate that the antiinflammatory response is down-regulated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pro-<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> begins 24 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, as indicated by the increased serum levels of interleukin-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The physiological balance between these two molecules is altered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
