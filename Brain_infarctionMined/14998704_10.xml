<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 28-year-old, highly educated male (patient RI) sustained a unilateral left ischemic infarction involving primarily the putamen and secondarily the head of the caudate and the anterior internal capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two detailed neuropsychological assessments, at 3 and 16 months post-infarction, revealed that a majority of cognitive abilities were spared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RI's general intelligence, simple attention, concept formation, cognitive flexibility, and explicit memory were unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Select cognitive abilities were affected, and these appeared to be related to direct involvement of the putamen and/or to indirect disruption of circuits between the basal ganglia and frontal lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistent with involvement of the left putamen, RI showed micrographia with his right hand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, his micrographia was context-dependent, appearing only when verbal expression was involved (e.g., present when writing spontaneously, but not when copying sentences or when drawing) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Evidence of disruption to frontal systems included variably decreased sustained attention, mildly decreased ability to generate words and to generate ideas, and significantly impaired abstraction ability in both verbal and visual modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although there are several possible interpretations for these findings, this pattern of cognitive and motor functioning is consistent with neuroimaging research suggesting that the frontal/subcortical circuit between the putamen and frontal motor areas plays a role in non-routine response selection and performance </plain></SENT>
