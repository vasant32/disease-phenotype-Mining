<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endothelin-1 is an important mediator involved in the development of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessing the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51451">endothelin-receptor antagonists</z:chebi> (ETRAs) in patients with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three studies met eligibility criteria, enrolling 867 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ETRAs significantly reduced the occurrence of DINDs (OR 0.68 [0.49 to 0.95]) and radiographic vasospasm (OR 0.31 [0.19 to 0.49]), but did not have any impact on mortality (OR 1.09 [0.69 to 1.72]) or poor neurological outcomes (OR 0.87 [0.63 to 1.20]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Any benefit of ETRAs may have been partially offset by adverse effects, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>(OR 2.39 [1.37 to 4.17]) and pulmonary complications (OR 2.12 [1.51 to 2.98]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although ETRAs reduce radiographic vasospasm and DINDs, there is currently no evidence that they improve outcomes </plain></SENT>
