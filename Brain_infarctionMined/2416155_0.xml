<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors present the clinical picture and time-course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> (A) in 25 patients, 18 of whom had had hemorrhagic and 7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dynamic neuropsychological examination and computer-aided tomography (CT) of the brain were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The development of marked and stable A was observed in 20% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency was higher with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and lower with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 3 cases of deep localization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> the authors describe a peculiar speech syndrome not observed in other aphasic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was characterized by (1) intactness of mechanisms underlying the realization of speech despite the presence of marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, (2) greater variability and inconsistence of results of implementation by patients of speech tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinico-CT correlations gave grounds for explaining the rate and degree of speech recovery, as well as the nature of A with the predominant lesion to some or other deep structures of the left hemisphere of the brain </plain></SENT>
