<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twelve (80%) had signs of cortical dysfunction, whereas risk factor profile, frequency of significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, and frequency of potential cardioembolic sources did not differ between patients with striatocapsular and those with cortical infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, patients with striatocapsular infarction more frequently had potential cardioembolic source and significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> than patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our findings show that large striatocapsular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> differ from lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> with regard to both presenting signs and symptoms, and pathogenesis, whereas they resemble <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> involving the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such patients should therefore be managed and treated as patients with cortical infarction </plain></SENT>
