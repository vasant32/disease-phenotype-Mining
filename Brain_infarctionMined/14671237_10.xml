<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background- Small capsular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> are difficult to assess with regard to the precise location and the extent of pyramidal tract damage with conventional brain imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Color-coded diffusion tensor imaging (CDTI) provides a means to visualize the course of the corticospinal tract within the white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to T2-weighted MRI, diffusion-weighted MRI and CDTI were used to analyze the topographical patterns of small lacunar corticospinal tract <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined 15 patients with pyramidal tract <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase (days 3 to 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lesions were identified on diffusion-weighted MRI and superimposed on CDTI images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The anatomic location and pattern of the lesion were visualized on CDTI with regard to the corticospinal tract and subsequently compared with the clinical presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas were evaluated with quantitative parameters: mean diffusivity and lattice anisotropy index of lesions were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 5 different patterns of corticospinal tract <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> falling into 2 clinical subgroups: (1) those with marked deficits and minor improvement (6/15) and (2) those with good recovery (9/15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Group 1 had long lesions centered in the pyramidal tract, involving the basal ganglia (anterior choroidal artery); group 2 lesions were very small and/or located anteriorly and medially (periventricular anterior choroidal artery territory; thalamogeniculate, tuberothalamic, and lateral striate branches) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lesions showed a significant increase of mean diffusivity and decrease of lattice anisotropy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CDTI allows in vivo differentiation of distinct subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Improved anatomic definition of lesion localization using CDTI may help in better establishing the prognosis for patients after subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
