<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used delayed perfusion, as represented by time to peak map on perfusion MRI, to classify <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in 39 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Strokes</z:hpo> were classified as hemodynamic if delayed perfusion extended to a whole territory of the occluded arterial trunk; as embolic if delayed perfusion was absent or restricted to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>; as arteriosclerotic if <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were small, multiple, and located mainly in the basal ganglias; or as unclassified if the pathophysiology was unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared these findings with vascular lesions on cerebral angiography, neurological signs, infarction on MRI, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> on <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-enhanced CT (Xe/CT) and collateral pathway development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Delayed perfusion clearly indicated the area of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Strokes</z:hpo> were classified as hemodynamic in 13 patients, embolic in 14 patients, arteriosclerotic in 6 patients and unclassified in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were seen only in deep white-matter areas such as the centrum semiovale or <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata, whereas embolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were in the cortex, cortex and subjacent white matter, and lenticulo-striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Embolic and arteriosclerotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> occurred even in <z:chebi fb="5" ids="24480">hemo</z:chebi>-dynamically compromised hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that perfusion MRI, in association with a detailed analysis of T2-weighted MRI of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the axial and coronal planes, can accurately classify <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as hemodynamic, embolic or arteriosclerotic </plain></SENT>
