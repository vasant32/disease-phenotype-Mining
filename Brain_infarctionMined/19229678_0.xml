<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> and white matter hyperintensities (WMHIs) observed on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI) are associated with increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Age is a strong predictor of WMHIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To use MRI to assess the presence of clinically silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> in older FH patients, and to compare the occurrence and size of these lesions in older FH patients with middle-aged FH patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 43 older (age &gt;or= 65 years) FH patients with the same FH North Karelia mutation, living in Finland, were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this comprehensive cohort, 1.5 T brain MRI was available for 33 individuals (age 65-84 years, M/F 9/24, mean duration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> treatment 15.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This group was divided into two age categories: 65-74 years (FHe1 group, n=23) and 75-84 years (FHe2 group, n=10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath>, including lacunas, and WMHIs on T2-weighted images were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Data from brain MRI were compared to those of a group of middle-aged FH patients with CHD (n=19, age 48-64 years) and with middle-aged healthy controls (n=29, age 49-63 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only two (6%) of the older FH patients had clinically silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> detected by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The amount of large WMHIs (&gt;5 mm in diameter) was similar in the FHe1 group compared with the groups of middle-aged FH patients and healthy controls, even though the FHe1 group was 13 years older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The total amount of WMHIs and the amount of large WMHIs were greatest in the FHe2 group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FH patients aged 65 to 74 years receiving long-term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> treatment (15 years) did not have more WMHIs on brain MRI compared to middle-aged FH patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
