<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to clarify the characteristics and mechanism of "Horner type" <z:hpo ids='HP_0009916'>anisocoria</z:hpo>, which is one of the symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner syndrome</z:hpo>, in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in regions supplied by the internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 112 consecutive patients (71 males and 41 females, mean age of 60.8 +/- 12.3 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> with either ICA or the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion, who were admitted to the National Cardiovascular Center within seven days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined differences in frequency of Horner type <z:hpo ids='HP_0009916'>anisocoria</z:hpo> and its duration after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> by the mechanism (embolic or thrombotic) and site (ICA proximal, ICA distal or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Horner type <z:hpo ids='HP_0009916'>anisocoria</z:hpo> was seen in 26 of 66 cases (39.4%) with embolic occlusion, which was more frequent than in those with thrombotic occlusion (8 of 46 cases, 17.4%) (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the embolic occlusion group, Horner type <z:hpo ids='HP_0009916'>anisocoria</z:hpo> was seen in 17 of 32 cases (53.1%) with ICA occlusion, which was more frequent than in those with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (9 of 34 cases, 26.5%) (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The duration of Horner type <z:hpo ids='HP_0009916'>anisocoria</z:hpo> was shorter in patients with either distal ICA or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion than in those with proximal ICA occlusion (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with thrombotic occlusion, there was no distinct characteristics in between those ICA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
