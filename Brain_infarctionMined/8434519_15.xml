<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood flow to the left cerebral hemisphere was interrupted by occluding simultaneously the left middle cerebral artery and both carotid arteries (CCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> lasted for 1, 2 or 3 hours after which animals survived for 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was determined utilizing computer-assisted measurements of serial brain sections stained with triphenyltetrazolium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue infarctions of variable size were observed following <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp> which persisted 1 or 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, remarkably-consistent infarction size was obtained following a three hours period of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was also estimated by measuring the volumes of the two hemispheres and expressing these values as a ratio for each animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The volume ratio was significantly greater in the 3 hour ischemic group, indicating the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in the infarcted hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that reversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, Sprague-Dawley rat results in consistent amounts of tissue infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This approach represents an attractive model system for studying the pathophysiological effects of transient, focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and for testing the effects of putative, therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
