<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Multimodal neuroimaging with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) scanning or functional MRI can detect and display functional reorganization of the brain's motor control in poststroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We undertook a study to determine whether the new modality of 128-electrode high-resolution EEG, coregistered with MRI, could detect changes in cortical motor control in patients after hemiplegic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recorded movement-related cortical potentials with left and right finger movements in 10 patients with varying degrees of recovery after hemiplegic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were male, and time since <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> varied from 6 to 144 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were right-handed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was also a comparison group of 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five of 8 patients with left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> had evidence of ipsilateral motor control of finger movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were only 2 cases of right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>; in addition, 1 patient had a posteriorly displaced motor potential originating behind a large left frontal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (rim) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reorganization of motor control takes place after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and may involve the ipsilateral or contralateral cortex, depending on the site and size of the brain lesion and theoretically, the somatotopic organization of the residual pyramidal tracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results are in good agreement with PET and functional MRI studies in the current literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>High-resolution EEG coregistered with MRI is a noninvasive imaging technique capable of displaying cortical motor reorganization </plain></SENT>
