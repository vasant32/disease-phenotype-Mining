<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are not only the major risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but they tend to cluster in families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unknown, however, whether these conditions occur more frequently among relatives of patients with specific types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as compared to non-relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and its major risk factors in two groups of subjects were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One group consisted of 76 siblings of 41 patients hospitalized with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> in an investigative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit; the other consisted of 55 siblings of the patients' spouses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of these conditions in the relatives was determined from a questionnaire completed by the relatives and supported by information from the relatives' family physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When considered separately, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred in a small but not statistically significant excess among the relatives in-law </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, various combinations of two or three diseases, (including <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>), occurred in 20.9% of the patients' siblings as compared to only 3.6% of the relatives in-law (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that living siblings of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> may have an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> as a result of multiple risk factors operating simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prevention programs among this high risk population may be particularly worthwhile </plain></SENT>
