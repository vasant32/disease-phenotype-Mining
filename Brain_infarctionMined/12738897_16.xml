<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (CS) in a patient with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is usually considered an indication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and not directly related to the development of this infarction subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to determine the relationship between CS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (LI) and to assess the differences between single and multiple LIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We classified 330 patients with a first-ever <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in the carotid territory into LI and non-LI (NLI) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the LI group, patients with a single LI and those with multiple LIs were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this last subgroup, 2 patterns were identified: 1 subtype with lacunar lesions distributed in both cerebral hemispheres, and another with lesions predominantly in 1 hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the LI group, isolated CS was significantly more frequent on the homolateral side than on the contralateral side (odds ratio [OR], 5.5; 95% CI, 1.2 to 23; P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant relationship between the pattern of distribution of the infarctions in only 1 hemisphere and homolateral CS &gt;70% was observed (OR, 4.4; 95% CI, 0.9 to 19; P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, the following variables were found to predict unilateral multiple LI: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (OR, 9.1; 95% CI, 2.5 to 33.6) and homolateral CS &gt;75% (OR, 14.4; 95% CI, 2.0 to 99.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The significant incidence of isolated ipsilateral CS in patients with LI located in the carotid territory and the relationship of CS to ipsilateral multiple LI suggest that CS has a very important role in the development of LI </plain></SENT>
