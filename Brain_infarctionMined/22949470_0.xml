<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The prevalence of silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> varies from 8% to 28% in the general elderly population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are associated with increased risk of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By definition, silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> lack clinically overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-like symptoms and fail to come to clinical attention; however, impaired recall of symptoms may be a potential confounder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim is to report a series of patients with incidentally detected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and examine whether they were truly asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects included in this study were drawn from ongoing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> research studies at the Memory Ageing and Cognition Center, in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants underwent a cranial MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incidental hyperintense lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging with corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient defects indicative of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical data for individuals with incidental hyperintense lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging were collated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six of 649 subjects had incidental hyperintense lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging; on retrospective questioning, 3 recalled symptoms temporally correlated with MRI lesions, which had been reported to but ignored by family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two subjects had focal neurological signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A majority of the subjects with incidental hyperintense lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging had significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> may be "silent" due to lack of awareness of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-like symptoms in the elderly and their families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Enhanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention education strategies are needed for the elderly population and, in particular, for their families </plain></SENT>
