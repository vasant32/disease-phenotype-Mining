<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Low cost and non-invasive bedside tests for detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> are needed as alternatives to contrast transesophageal echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether dye dilution curves and oximeter recordings are useful for detecting <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> and what is the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> in patients with cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> determined with these bedside methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also studied whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors, number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence rates were different in patients with an unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Dye dilution curves and oximeter recordings with non-invasive earpiece apparatus were obtained in 59 patients aged under 50 years who had had a cryptogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of ischemic lesions in the brain was counted by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> was found in 24 (41%) of 59 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a 100% concordance in results obtained by dye dilution and by oximetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were similar in subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> and those without <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant association was found between <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> and Valsalva-like activity at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Those with <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> did not have more ischemic lesions detected by MRI nor did they have more recurrent ischemic episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Dye dilution and oximetry are cheap and useful methods for detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> and could be used for screening of the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paradoxical embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because these 2 methods were not compared with the golden standard, transesophageal echocardiography, the specificity and sensitivity of the tests remain unsettled </plain></SENT>
