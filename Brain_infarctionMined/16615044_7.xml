<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the incidence, clinical course and prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> (MoS) following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: A total of 1,846 ALL patients were treated with four consecutive TCCSG ALL protocols (L84-11, L89-12, L92-13, and L95-14) between 1984 and 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We surveyed the MoS cases among these patients in the follow-up studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six patients with MoS were identified: four boys and two girls whose ages ranged from 2 years and 1 month (abbreviated as "2y1m") to 14y 1 m at diagnosis of ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> six patients received prophylactic cranial irradiation with a dosage of 18 or 24 Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although one patient died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> due to MoS, no leukemic relapse was observed in the group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of MoS in our series was 0.46 +/- 0.02% at 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among several clinical characteristics, use of cranial irradiation was the only factor that appeared to be significantly related to the development of MoS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MoS occurs with increased frequency in children treated for ALL, and might be associated with cranial irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic cranial irradiation should be used cautiously in ALL patients who can be cured by other <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>-directed therapies </plain></SENT>
