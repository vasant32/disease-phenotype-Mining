<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few cases have been reported in which recurrent infarction occurred in spite of adequate anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a young man with fenestrated vertebral arteries and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who failed to respond to standard anticoagulation therapy but did well with angiographic coil obliteration of an abnormal vertebral segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An 18-year-old left-handed man presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> of dizziness and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No trauma or other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> was seen on CT, but the cause could not be identified by brain and neck MRI, MRA, or CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bilateral fenestrated vertebral arteries were identified with conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the patient recovered fully and was treated with anticoagulation, he suffered a recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> 1 month later involving the right cerebellum while he was on a therapeutic dose of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Repeat arteriography showed a spontaneous dissection within one of the fenestrated vertebral segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since receiving angiographic coil obliteration of the pathologic segment, he has been free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the patient sustained recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> in his posterior circulation due to spontaneous dissection within a fenestrated vertebral artery segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conventional angiography and emergent interventional embolization were essential to his diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
