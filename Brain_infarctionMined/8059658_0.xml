<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the contribution of cranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography (MRA) for the evaluation of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and MRA studies performed on 78 adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were retrospectively reviewed and correlated with the clinical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 50 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and 28 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> infarctions in our series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five of 78 MRA exams (6%) were nondiagnostic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty examinations (80%) were positive for stenosis or occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distribution of stenotic or occlusive vascular lesions correlated with the location of infarction in 56 of the 60 positive cases (93%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRA provided information not obtained from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images in 40 cases (55%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One hundred four individual vessels in 8 patients who underwent conventional cerebral angiography were compared with the MRA appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The MRA interpretations correlated with the conventional angiographic evaluations for 90 vessels (87%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vascular lesions demonstrated on intracranial MRA show a high correlation with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MRA provides information adjunctive to conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> in a majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that MRA is an important component of the complete evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
