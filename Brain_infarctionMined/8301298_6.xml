<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A histopathological analysis of segments of the thrombosed large intracranial arteries was carried out on eight patients who died within 28 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study revealed occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in six and mural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in two, developing mostly at the site of greatest stenosis or just distal to it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The histological characteristics of the thrombosed arteries were plaque rupture in three, intramural haemorrhage in one, ulceration in one, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the absence of plaque rupture or intramural haemorrhage in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Occlusive emboli distal to the site of cerebral artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (intracranial artery-to-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>) were observed in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The following conclusions were drawn from the study: 1) plaque rupture or intraplaque haemorrhage is not a sine qua non for cerebral artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>; 2) occlusions occur at the site of greatest <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> compromise or just distal to it, and 3) non-occlusive mural <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> can occur in the absence of plaque rupture and eventually lead to local occlusion or distal embolisation </plain></SENT>
