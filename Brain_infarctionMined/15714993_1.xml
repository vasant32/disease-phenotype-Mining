<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Certain researchers have proposed that patients with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> can be classified into two clinically distinct entities: patients with a single, symptomatic lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, and patients with multiple lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> together with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and leukoaraiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study attempted to delineate the characteristics of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and evaluate the validity of the aforementioned hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 130 consecutive patients with first-time symptomatic lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were dichotomized into two groups according to two different kinds of models as follows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Model-1: patients with a single lacune and patients with multiple lacunes; and Model-2: patients with large lacune and patients with small lacune </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Associated factors for the multiple lacune group compared with the single lacune group as well as the large lacune group compared with the small lacune group, were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Associated factors included age, sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, smoking, extracranial and intra-cranial vascular lesions, extent of lacunes and white matter lesions, progression status and blood pressure in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage, and coagulation markers such as fibrinogen, thrombin-antithrombin complex, D-dimer, beta-thromboglobulin, platelet factor 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results for Model-1: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (age-and sex-adjusted OR: 2.58, p = 0.017) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004421'>elevated systolic blood pressure</z:hpo> (&gt;160mmHg for the mean value during the first post-ictal week; OR: 2.55, p = 0.016) were significantly associated with the multiple lacune group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Large lacunes (&gt;10mm in diameter) were negatively associated with the multiple lacune group (OR: 0.38, p = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Association between confluent white matter lesions and the multiple lacune group approached significance (OR: 2.16, p = 0.056) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Results for Model-2: female sex (OR: 0.39, p = 0.021), mild stenosis of intracranial and extracranial arteries (&lt;25%) (intracranial; OR: 5.42, p = 0.0042, extracranial; OR: 3.30, p = 0.016), progressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (OR: 6.77, p&lt;0.0001), and high levels of TAT (&gt;3ng/ml) (OR: 2.80, p = 0.039) were significantly associated with the large lacune group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multiple lacunes (OR: 0.38, p = 0.016) and confluent white matter lesions (OR: 0.28, p = 0.007) exhibited a significant negative association with the large lacune group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, underlying vasculopathy in the presence of multiple lacunes may correspond to lipohyalinosis resulting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Moreover, large lacune may correspond to microatheroma at the orifice of penetrating arteries </plain></SENT>
