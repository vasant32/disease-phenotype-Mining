<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) is thought to be an important factor that mediates neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the signaling pathways in the brain in vivo after oral GGA administration remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured and compared infarction volumes to investigate the effect of GGA on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> induced by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effects of pretreatment with 5-hydroxydecanoate (5HD), a specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> (mitoK(ATP)) channel inhibitor; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> (DZX), a selective mitoK(ATP) channel opener and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi> (Wort), a specific PI3K inhibitor of GGA-induced neuroprotection against infarction volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To clarify the relationship between PI3K/Akt activation and neuroprotection, we used immunoblot analysis to determine the amount of p-Akt proteins present after GGA administration with or without Wort treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotective effects of GGA (pretreatment with a single oral GGA dose (800 mg/kg) 48 h before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) were prevented by 5HD, DZX and Wort pretreatment, which indicates that the selective mitoK(ATP) channel and the PI3K/Akt pathway may mediate GGA-dependent protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Oral GGA-induced p-Akt and GGA pretreatment enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced p-Akt, both of which were prevented by Wort pretreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that a single oral dose of GGA induces p-Akt and that GGA plays an important role in neuroprotection against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> through the mitoK(ATP) channel opening </plain></SENT>
