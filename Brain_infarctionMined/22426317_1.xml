<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pretreatment <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume appears to predict clinical outcome after intra-arterial therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To confirm the importance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in patients undergoing intra-arterial therapy, we sought to characterize the relationship between final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (FIV) and long-term functional outcome in a prospective cohort of endovascularly treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From our prospective intra-arterial therapy database, we identified 107 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> with anterior circulation proximal <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> who underwent final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> imaging and had 3-month modified Rankin Scale scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical, imaging, treatment, and outcome data were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age was 66.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median admission National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score was 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion (Thrombolysis In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral Infarction</z:e> 2A-3) was achieved in 78 (72.9%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven (25.2%) patients achieved a 3-month good outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0-2), and 30 (28.0%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median FIV was 71.4 cm(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FIV independently correlated with functional outcome across the entire modified Rankin Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In receiver operating characteristic analysis, it was the best discriminator of both good outcome (area under the curve=0.857) and mortality (area under the curve=0.772) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A FIV of approximately 50 cm(3) demonstrated the greatest accuracy for distinguishing good versus poor outcome, and a FIV of approximately 90 cm(3) was highly specific for a poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The interaction term between FIV and age was the only independent predictor of good outcome (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The impact of FIV was accentuated in patients &lt;80 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> who undergo intra-arterial therapy, final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume is a critical determinant of 3-month functional outcome and appears suitable as a surrogate biomarker in proof-of-concept intra-arterial therapy trials </plain></SENT>
