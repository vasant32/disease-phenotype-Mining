<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sophocarpine, one of the major <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22315">alkaloid</z:chebi> compounds isolated from Sophora pachycarpa, is highly valued and important in traditional Chinese medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we aimed to explore the possible mechanisms underlying sophocarpine-mediated neuroprotection against transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sophocarpine (5, 10, or 20mg/kg) was given 30min before focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced in rats by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After sophocarpine treatment, the total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was significantly decreased in comparison to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of a neurological evaluation were significantly improved in the sophocarpine treated group when compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of TUNEL-positive cells was significantly reduced compared to the untreated ischemic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results of Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining indicated that pretreatment with sophocarpine down-regulated the expression of acid-sensing ion channel 1 (ASIC1) in the ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that sophocarpine ameliorated the ischemic injury induced by transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats and that this neuroprotective effect might be related to the anti-ASIC1 channel and anti-apoptotic action of sophocarpine </plain></SENT>
