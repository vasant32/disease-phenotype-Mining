<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: We report our experience with a rare and interesting subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> patients with arterial involvement: <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation types of angio-BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1994 to 2008, seven cases of arterial BD with 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation and 4 <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were found amongst BD patients in the department of internal medicine of Habib Thameur Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Combination of venous and arterial manifestations occurred in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were male and the mean age when arterial involvement manifested was diagnosed was about 39.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The artery most often affected is the aorta followed by the pulmonary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain infraction occurred in about 4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001701'>Pericarditis</z:hpo> and neurological symptoms were more frequently noted in patients with arterial BD than others without vasculo-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients were successfully operated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were alive after a mean of 7.8 years follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Arterial involvement is more frequently noted in vasculo-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e> than <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and it's associated with a high morbidity and mortality rate </plain></SENT>
