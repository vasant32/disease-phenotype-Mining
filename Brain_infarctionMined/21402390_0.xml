<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Small deep brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are often caused by two different vascular pathologies: 1. atheromatous occlusion at the orifice of large caliber penetrating arteries termed branch atheromatous disease (BAD) and 2. lipohyalinotic degenerative changes termed lipohyalinotic degeneration (LD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We herein analyze and describe the characteristics of these 2 different pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 394 patients with penetrating artery territory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the territories of the lenticulostriate arteries and anterior pontine arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Radiologically defined BAD of the lenticulostriate arteries was defined as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> with size more than 10mm in diameter on axial slice and visible for 3 or more axial slices, and that of the anterior pontine arteries was defined as unilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> extending to the basal surface of the pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within each of the 2 territory groups, differences between BAD and LD were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety five patients in the lenticulostriate arteries group (36.1%) and 78 patients in anterior pontine arteries group (59.5%) were classified as BAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Initial NIHSS, incidence of progressive motor deficits and poor functional outcome were significantly higher and incidence of concomitant silent lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> tended to be lower in BAD than LD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In logistic regression analysis, BAD compared with LD was independently associated with PMD, in lenticulostriate arteries group (OR: 4.21, p=0.0001) and in anterior pontine arteries group (OR: 5.32, p=0.0018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Radiologically defined BAD and LD had different characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BAD was significantly associated with progressive motor deficits and considered as a major vascular mechanism of progressive motor deficits in penetrating artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
