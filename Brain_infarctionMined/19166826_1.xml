<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: 131 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients and 64 controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analyzed risk factors included conventional risk factors, total plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level and polymorphisms of the main enzymes of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> metabolism-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (polymorphisms C677T and A1298C) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17755">cystathionine</z:chebi> beta synthase (polymorphism T833C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We confirmed the occurrence of a number of conventional risk factors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> is an independent risk factor (p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> correlated inversely with plasma vitamin B(6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also found a relationship between C677T polymorphism type and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> (p=0.0266) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of studied polymorphisms in the population of northern Poland was higher than reported previously for similar populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, none of the studied genetic factors were found to be significant risk factors in ischemic brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
