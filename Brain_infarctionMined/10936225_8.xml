<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tiagabine, injected at 1 h after embolization, significantly reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> volume, measured with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) histological assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were varying degrees of neuroprotective effect exhibited in the other experimental groups however this did not reach significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that tiagabine is neuroprotective when administrated at an early period after the ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
