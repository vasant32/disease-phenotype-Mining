<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to develop and test a 3D bolus-tracking <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> technique for perfusion imaging of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathological (infarcted) human brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> experiments were performed on standard 1.5 T GE/Signa clinical scanners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers and one patient with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Modified [frequency-shifted (FS)] BURST MRI was performed during injection of a bolus of Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> (0.13 mmol/kg) in the antecubital vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 3D datasets were acquired with a time resolution of 2.2 s and an effective spatial resolution of 4.3 x 4.3 x 6.4 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional maps of blood volume and bolus arrival time were determined by fitting a synthetic curve to the intensity time course on a voxel-by-voxel basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both relative cerebral blood volume and arrival time maps demonstrated sensitivity to regional differences in blood supply in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain and in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The transit time maps showed arrival time delays of 5-7 s within and around the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and confirmed the diagnosis of left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of the measurements on both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and diseased human brain demonstrated the ability to acquire valuable 3D information about brain perfusion using FS BURST MRI </plain></SENT>
