<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In animal cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> experiments, the most important aspect is to produce consistent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to improve the conventional middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) coagulation technique, we developed a new animal model using a microclip to reduce variability in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were divided into two groups; conventional <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion group (Group 1; n = 9) and modified clip occlusion group (Group 2; n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Group 2, the proximal portion of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was occluded by applying a small clip just proximal to the olfactory nerve, and the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> from the clipped position to the position just proximal to the level of the inferior cerebral vein was electrocoagulated using a bipolar diathermy in the same manner as in Group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In other words, the only difference between these two groups was the manner of occlusion of the most proximal portion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rats were killed 24 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-inducing surgery, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was determined by an image analysis program following staining with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were 51.0 +/- 13.8% in Group 1 and 46.3 +/- 6.2% in Group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The scattering of cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was significantly small in Group 2 (p=0.0176) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The differences in scattering of striatal and total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present results demonstrated that the new <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion model using a clip significantly reduces the variability in cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, solving the problems of the model using coagulation alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>That permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion model using a clip is an excellent method that produces more consistent and reproducible infarction </plain></SENT>
