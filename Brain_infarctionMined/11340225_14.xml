<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The mechanisms involved in the neurological deterioration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although accumulating evidence suggests that <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release plays a role in the progression of territorial infarctions, it remains to be established whether excitotoxicity also participates in lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether excitatory and inhibitory amino acid concentrations in blood predict subsequent progressive motor deficits in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 113 consecutive patients with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, defined by clinical and computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging criteria, within the first 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological deterioration was defined as a decrease of &gt;/=1 points in the motor items of the Canadian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale in the first 48 hours after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">Glutamate</z:chebi>, glycine, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography in plasma samples obtained on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Predictive values, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of specific <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> concentrations and glutamatexglycine/<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> index for progression of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients (23.9%) had neurological worsening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> (253+/-70 versus 123+/-73 micromol/L, mean+/-SD) were higher and those of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> (140+/-63 versus 411+/-97 nmol/L) were lower in the progressing group than in the nonprogressing group (both P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">Glutamate</z:chebi> concentrations &gt;200 micromol/L and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> levels &lt;240 nmol/L had a positive predictive value for neurological deterioration of 67% and 84%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A excitotoxic index &gt;106 had a positive predictive value of 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that an imbalance between the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> concentrations may play a role in the pathophysiology of progressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
