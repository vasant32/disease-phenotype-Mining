<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze the findings of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor Imaging (DTI) in patients with multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS), and to explore their role in reflecting the pathological changes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DWI and DTI were performed on 41 MS cases and 25 sub-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cases which used as control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The appearances of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps, EADC maps and FA maps in patients of both groups were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantitative analysis of the values of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, EADC and FA in the center and periphery of the lesions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MS, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> MS and sub-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was carried out separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULT: In DWI, the small <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lesions were iso-intensity, and the large <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MS lesions and the sub-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> lesions had a high signal intensity to various degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the EADC map, only in 13 cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MS around the peripheral zone of the lesions there was a high signal intensity, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other cases, including the cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> MS and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> had no high signal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> lesions were similar (P &gt; 0.05), both of them had the highest <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> value which were higher than the signal intensity in the center (both P &lt; 0.05) and the periphery (both P &lt; 0.05) of the MS lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The FA values in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> lesions were the lowest, much more lower than that in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> MS lesions (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The FA value in the center of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MS lesions was lower than that in the peripheral zone (P &lt; 0.05), and higher than the FA value both in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> MS and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> lesions (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lowest <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> value outside the peripheral zone of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MS lesions and the highest EADC value were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The significance of DWI high signal in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of MS is not reliable, so the patient's history and the findings found in the routine MRI must be conjugated when an imaging diagnosis is made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The EADC map is more accurate than <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> map for showing the diffusion restriction of water molecular in the MS lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The degree of increase of the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> value and the degree of decease of the FA value are proportional to the degree of severity of the pathological changes of the MS lesions </plain></SENT>
