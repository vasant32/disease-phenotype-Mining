<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diseases associated with cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp>, such as arterial embolism or hematological, infectious and immunological disorders were not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The following parameters were tested: antithrombin III, protein C, plasminogen, fibrinolytic capacity after infusion of DDAVP, and free and total protein S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prothrombin times of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges; no woman had taken oral contraceptives for at least 3 months before examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 9 patients (8 women, 1 man) a decrease of free and total protein S was found; in 4 additional patients (2 women, 2 men) only the free protein S was reduced </plain></SENT>
