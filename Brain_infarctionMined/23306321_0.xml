<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed the digital subtraction angiography acquired in 96 patients who had first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> attributed to ORV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Another age-matched 115 patients who had no radiotherapy but symptomatic high-grade (&gt;70%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e> were enrolled as referent subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction angiography was performed within 2 months from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and delineated carotid and vertebrobasilar circulations from aortic arch up to intracranial branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two reviewers blinded to group assignment recorded <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> vascular lesions, collateral status, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ORV patients had less atherosclerotic risk factors at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In referent patients, high-grade stenoses were mostly focal at the proximal internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, high-grade ORV lesions diffusely involved the common carotid artery and internal carotid artery and were more frequently bilateral (54% versus 22%), tandem (23% versus 10%), associated with complete occlusion in one or both carotid arteries (30% versus 9%), vertebral artery (VA) steno-occlusions (28% versus 16%), and external carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (19% versus 5%) (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With comparable rates of vascular anomaly, ORV patients showed more established collateral circulations through leptomeningeal arteries, anterior communicating artery, posterior communicating artery, suboccipital/costocervical artery, and retrograde flow in ophthalmic artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In terms of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> topography, the frequencies of cortical or subcortical watershed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ORV angiographic features and corresponding collaterals are distinct from atherosclerotic patterns at initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Clinical decompensation, despite more extensive collateralization, may precipitate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in ORV </plain></SENT>
