<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are few studies on the anatomical basis for loss of cognitive function in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to investigate the association between type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and markers of brain aging on magnetic resonance images, including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, lacunes, and white matter hyperintensities as markers of vascular damage and general and hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> as markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> in Japanese-American men born between 1900 and 1919 and followed since 1965 in the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Prevalent and incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Associations between magnetic resonance imaging markers and diabetic status were estimated with logistic regression, controlling for sociodemographic and other vascular factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the cohort is 38% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had a moderately elevated risk for lacunes (odds ratio [OR] 1.6 [95% CI 1.0-2.6]) and hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (1.7 [0.9-2.9]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk for both hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and lacunes/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was twice as high in subjects with compared with those without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the group with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, those with the longest duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, those taking insulin, and those with complications had relatively more pathologic brain changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that older individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> have an elevated risk for vascular brain damage and neurodegenerative changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These pathological changes may be the anatomical basis for an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
