<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to investigate the clinical and anatomical correlates which can predict future QOL in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study subjects consisted of 69 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> who were followed up 2 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> event at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quality of life was evaluated during the 2-month follow up period after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline information or data including clinical and anatomical correlates (Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory, Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> Inventory, Barthel's Index, MRI data) at the time of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> event were collected by performing a review of each patient's chart and research data files </plain></SENT>
