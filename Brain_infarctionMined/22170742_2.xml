<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cortical microinfarcts (CMIs) observed in brains of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> tend to be located close to vessels afflicted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> (CAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CMIs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> are preferentially distributed in the arterial borderzone, an area most vulnerable to hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the causal association between CAA and CMIs remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study consists of two parts: (1) an observational study using postmortem human brains (n = 31) to determine the association between CAA and CMIs, and (2) an experimental study to determine whether hypoperfusion worsens CAA and induces CMIs in a CAA mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In postmortem human brains, the density of CMIs was 0.113/cm(2) in mild, 0.584/cm(2) in moderate, and 4.370/cm(2) in severe CAA groups with a positive linear correlation (r = 0.6736, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that, among seven variables (age, disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>senile plaques</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo>, CAA, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and white matter damage), only the severity of CAA was a significant multivariate predictor of CMIs (p = 0.0022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the data from human brains, CAA model mice following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> due to bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> induced with 0.18-mm diameter microcoils showed accelerated deposition of leptomeningeal amyloid β (Aβ) with a subset of them developing microinfarcts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the CAA mice without hypoperfusion exhibited very few leptomeningeal Aβ depositions and no microinfarcts by 32 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following 12 weeks of hypoperfusion, cerebral blood flow decreased by 26% in CAA mice and by 15% in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, suggesting impaired microvascular function due to perivascular Aβ accumulation after hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> accelerates CAA, and thus promotes CMIs </plain></SENT>
