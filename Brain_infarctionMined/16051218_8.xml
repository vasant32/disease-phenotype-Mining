<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immediately following, and 1 day after the insult there was no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>But at 3 to 5 days after the HI insult, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> uptake into the hippocampus was markedly reduced; however, after 30 or 60 days the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> uptake into hippocampal slices returned to control levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, this study demonstrated the effect of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="16" ids="16750">Guo</z:chebi>) on the [3H] <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> uptake in neonatal HI injury, maintaining the [3H] <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> uptake at control levels when injected before and after insult HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that neonatal HI influences <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> uptake a few days following insult, and that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi> prevents this action </plain></SENT>
