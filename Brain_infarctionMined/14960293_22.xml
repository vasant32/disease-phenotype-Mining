<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are a proportion of patients with poststroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (PSD) who do not respond to antidepressants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) might be a safe and effective alternative in these refractory cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a randomized, parallel, double-blind study of active versus sham left prefrontal rTMS in patients with refractory PSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After discontinuing antidepressants, patients were randomly assigned to receive 10 sessions of active (10 Hz, 110% of the motor threshold, 20 trains of 5 seconds duration) or sham left prefrontal rTMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Efficacy measures included HAM-D scores, response and remission rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients completed a neuropsychological battery at baseline and after completing the protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When compared with sham stimulation, 10 sessions of active rTMS of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were associated with a significant reduction of depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This reduction was not influenced by patient's age, type or location of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, volume of left frontal leukoaraiosis or by the distance of the stimulating coil to the prefrontal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, there was a significant positive correlation between the percentage of reduction of Ham-D scores and frontal gray and white matter volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no significant changes in cognitive functioning between the active and the sham stimulation groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, there were few and mild adverse effects that were equally distributed among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these preliminary findings suggest that rTMS may be an effective and safe treatment alternative for patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
