<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Decompressive hemicraniectomy (DC) and duroplasty after malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> or traumatic brain injury is a common surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Usually, preserved bone flaps are being reimplanted after resolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alloplast cranioplasties are seldom directly implanted due to the risk of wound healing disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While numerous studies deal with DC, little is known about the encountered problems of bone flap reimplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, aim of the study was to identify surgery-associated complications after bone flap reimplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart analysis of patients that underwent DC and subsequent bone flap reimplantation between 2001 and 2011 at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We registered demographic data, initial clinical diagnosis and surgery-associated complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 136 patients that underwent DC and subsequent reimplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-one patients (30.1%) had early or late surgery-associated complications after bone flap reimplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most often, bone flap resorption and postoperative wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were the underlying causes (73%, n=30/41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified age (p=0.045; OR=16.30), GOS prior to cranioplasty (p=0.03; OR=2.38) and <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> abuse as a prognostic factor for surgery-associated complications (p=0.043; OR=4.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients with early cranioplasty had a better functional outcome than patients with late cranioplasty (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Almost one-third of the patients that are operated on for bone flap reimplantation after DC suffer from surgery-associated complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Most often, wound healing disorders as well as bone flap resorption lead to a second or even third operation with the need for artificial bone implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results might raise the question, if subsequent operations can be avoided, if an artificial bone is initially chosen for cranioplasty </plain></SENT>
