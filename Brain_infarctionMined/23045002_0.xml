<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, due to the complexity of this pathological condition in humans, to date there is no ideal animal model that completely reproduces this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This unit describes the most widely used rodent animal model for the study of hypoxic-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> during development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The model consists of 7-day-old pup rats subjected to unilateral carotid artery ligation followed by timed <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> exposure, and incorporates both focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Its strength lies in the relative ease of the surgical procedure, the low mortality rate, and the possibility of performing long-term experiments, a necessity for preclinical therapeutic trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over the years, this model has been extensively characterized, and most information on the mechanisms responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> and possible therapeutic approaches following <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> during brain development derives from studies performed using this model </plain></SENT>
