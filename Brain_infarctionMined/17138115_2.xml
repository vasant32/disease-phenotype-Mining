<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Accurate identification of infarcted regions of the brain is critical in management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An efficient and fast method for identification and segmentation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the diffusion-weighted images (DWI) is proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DWI scans were acquired with a slice thickness of 5 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have used a probabilistic neural network for selecting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> slices and an adaptive (two-level) Gaussian mixture model for segmentation of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis, such as identification of distribution, first-order statistics calculation, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average dice index is about 0.6, and average sensitivity and specificity are about 81% and 99%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The value of sensitivity and dice index are influenced by the number of false positives and false negatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because artifacts and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> have similar imaging characteristics, it is difficult to completely eliminate the artifacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of localization is nearly 100% as there were only two false-positive and three false-negative slices of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 381 slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The algorithm takes about 1 minute in the Matlab computing environment to process a volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A method to localize and segment the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> is proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The method <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> the clinician in reducing the time needed to localize and segment the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The speed of localization and segmentation can be enhanced further by implementing the algorithm in VC++ and using fast algorithms for selection of Gaussian mixture model parameters </plain></SENT>
