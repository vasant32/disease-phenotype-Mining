<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty Wistar male rats were randomly divided into sham-operated group, untreated group, and high-, medium- and low-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17368">Hyp</z:chebi>-treated groups (50, 25 and 12.5 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) and ginkgo leaf-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The animals were intragastrically administered with drugs for 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes after the end administration, the operation was performed to induce the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model in rats with the method of intraluminal thread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery blood flow was blocked for 2 hours, and then reperfused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours later, the rats' neurology score was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining and dried wet method were carried out to measure the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and the water content of rat brain tissue respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The above-mentioned indexes in the untreated group showed significant differences compared with those in the sham-operated group (P&lt;0.01).The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> sizes of rat brain tissue in the high- and medium-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17368">Hyp</z:chebi>-treated groups were obviously decreased compared with that in the untreated group (P&lt;0.01, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The water content of rat brain and the neurology score were also obviously reduced compared with those in the untreated group (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17368">Hyp</z:chebi> could obviously reduce the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> degree in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> reperfusion injury rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="17368">Hyp</z:chebi> has significant protective effect on focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
