<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> cell line Panc-1 cells were incubated with 50 to 400 microM of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26374">pterin</z:chebi> derivative, 2-(N,N-dimethylaminomethyleneamino)-6-formyl-3-pivaloylpteridine-4-one (DFP), and the equivalent dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi>, reactive oxygen species (ROS), were generated, and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ROS generation and the loss of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential (MMP) preceding cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were simultaneously monitored using time-lapse microscopy with an ROS-sensitive dye and a probe to monitor MMP, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was also estimated quantitatively by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide</z:chebi> assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ROS generation and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were prominent when more than 100 microM of each agent was used in combination, whereas the sole use of each agent did not show any effects even at the highest dose, 400 microM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chemical analysis revealed that DFP and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> react immediately in aqueous solution and produce a new compound named DFP-E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DFP-E chemically reacted with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> much faster than DFP and generated ROS, and biologically, it was much more cell-permeable than DFP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings collectively indicated that the combined use of DFP with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> produced DFP-E, which caused intracellular ROS generation and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was observed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> reacted with another <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26374">pterin</z:chebi> derivative to yield an ROS-generating compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As a result, care should be taken with the clinical use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26374">pterin</z:chebi> derivatives stay in the body </plain></SENT>
