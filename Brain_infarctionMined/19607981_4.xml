<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> is converted by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase into <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi>), and the latter is then transformed into the toxic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radical</z:chebi>, through the Haber-Weiss reaction, converted to water by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GPx) or dismuted to water and oxygen through catalase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accumulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> has been suggested to exert neurotoxic effects, although recent in vitro studies have demonstrated either physiological or protective roles of this molecule in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In particular, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> is critically involved in brain damage induced by transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of GPx by systemic (i.p.) administration of mercaptosuccinate (MS, 1.5-150 mg/kg) dose-dependently reduces brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> damage produced by transient (2 h) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotection was observed when the drug was administered 15 min before the ischemic insult, whereas no effect was detected when the drug was injected 1h before MCAo or upon reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, application of MS (1 mM) to corticostriatal slices limited the irreversible functional derangement of field potentials caused by a prolonged (12 min) oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This effect was reverted by concomitant bath application of the catalase inhibitor 3-aminotriazole (20mM), suggesting the involvement of catalase in mediating the neuroprotective effects of MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, our findings demonstrate that MS is neuroprotective in both in vivo and in vitro ischemic conditions, through a mechanism which may involve increased endogenous levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> and its consequent conversion to molecular oxygen by catalase </plain></SENT>
