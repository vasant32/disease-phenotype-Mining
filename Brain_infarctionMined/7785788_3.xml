<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their BPs were retrospectively referred to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The average values of mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) on admission were 137 mmHg in hypertensive patients (HT; n = 9) and 101 mmHg in normotensives (NT; n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HT patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment after admission and MABP decreased by 22 mmHg (14%) prior to the ictus (three to sixty-five days after admission) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MABP in NT patients remained constant before the attack (-1.4 mmHg, four to one hundred ten days after admission) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, MABP decreased by 17 mmHg (four to ninety-three days) before the ictus in patients with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n = 9), whereas it changed only a little in patients without history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BP in each group elevated immediately after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and gradually decreased to 90% of the resting level after two weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An excessive reduction of BP may induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in HT or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients or cause it to recur </plain></SENT>
