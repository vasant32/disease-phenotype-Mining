<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a reaching box, mice were trained to reach food pellets with their left forelimb through a 0.5 cm slit for 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by occluding the right middle cerebral artery, and the percentage of success in obtaining food was observed for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In comparison, the neurological deficit score, the holding angle in an inclined board test, and right turns in a corner test were simultaneously performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the end of the experiments, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and neuron densities were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULT: After focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, the percentage of success in the reaching test was reduced, the right turns in the corner test were increased, the neurological deficit score was increased, and the holding angle in the inclined board test was reduced as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The holding angle recovered 5 d after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, whereas other 3 indicators remained abnormal until 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the end of the experiments, the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were increased, and the neuron densities in the cortex, hippocampal CA1 region and striatum were reduced in ischemic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The skill reaching test is an objective and stable method for evaluating long-term neurological deficits after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in mice </plain></SENT>
