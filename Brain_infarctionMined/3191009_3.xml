<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine arteries (20.5%) were symptomatic at last follow-up, including 13 (6.8%) producing ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight sides underwent carotid endarterectomy, 16 for symptomatic lesions at a mean interval of 14.5 months after the initial diagnostic study, with no neurologic deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients (16.2%) died, eight from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (30%), and 12 from cardiac causes (44%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In initially symptomatic sides, the incidence of any subsequent neurologic event (28.7%) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (25%) was significantly greater than in asymptomatic arteries (14.6% and 12%, respectively) (p less than .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carotid arteries with greater than 80% stenosis by arteriography and duplex scanning had a 46% incidence of further symptoms and 41.6% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> rate compared to 19.6% and 15%, respectively, in arteries with less than 80% stenosis (p less than .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cumulative life table analysis at 12, 24 and 36 months showed greater than 80% stenosed arteries to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> free rates of 69%, 50.5%, and 21.6% compared to 91%, 83.7%, and 76% for arteries with less than 80% stenosis (p less than .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At a mean follow-up of over two years, nonoperated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (greater than 50%) carries a 20.5% risk of neurologic symptoms and a 6.8% risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 61.5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> being fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> had a significantly greater incidence of ensuing neurologic events than asymptomatic arteries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
