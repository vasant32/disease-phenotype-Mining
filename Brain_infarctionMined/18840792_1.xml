<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To prospectively investigate the patterns and rates of progression of magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging abnormalities in a well-documented cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> with subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> (CADASIL) cohort 7 years after baseline and to identify the prognostic factors that determine the rates and patterns of this progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The local ethics committee approved the study, and informed consent was obtained from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From 12 unrelated families, 25 patients who were NOTCH3 mutation carriers and 13 who were non-mutation carriers were examined clinically and with standardized <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging at baseline and after 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The progression of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, microbleeding, and brain volume loss was measured semiquantitatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correlation testing and group comparison testing were performed to identify the risk factors associated with increased progression of CADASIL-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the non-mutation carriers, the mutation carriers showed significant increases in numbers of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (P &lt; .01), WMH (P &lt; .01), and microbleed (P &lt; .05) lesions but no increased loss of brain volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distributions of new WMHs and new lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> at follow-up were similar to the distributions of these abnormalities at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High WMH (P &lt; .05), lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (P &lt; .01), and microbleed (P &lt; .01) lesion loads at baseline--but not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>--were associated with faster progression of these abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with CADASIL who have a high <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> abnormality lesion load at baseline are at risk for faster progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> abnormalities </plain></SENT>
