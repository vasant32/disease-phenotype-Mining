<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> plays an important role in atherogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that the concentration of peripheral inflammatory markers, particularly C-reactive protein (CRP), strongly correlates with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity and independently predicts mortality and recurrent vascular events in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between inflammatory markers and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity by means of volumetric measurement of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From March 1, 2008, to February 28, 2009, 96 patients who had laboratory investigations and magnetic resonance imaging scans were included retrospectively in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesions were outlined using a semiautomatic threshold technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted imaging lesion volumes were measured with MIPAV software (Medical Image Processing, Analysis and Visualization, version 4.1.1; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relationship between highly selective CRP (hs-CRP) levels and DWI <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume quartiles was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 66.9 years, and 50 patients (51.2%) were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between hs-CRP and DWI volumes (Spearman œÅ = 0.239, P = .010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median hs-CRP values for successive volumes of DWI lesion quartiles (lowest to highest quartile) were as follows: 1.17, 1.14, 1.63, and 3.76 (P = .029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Higher hs-CRP levels were associated with larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that elevated hs-CRP levels, reflecting a large volume of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, may serve as a helpful serologic marker in the evaluation of severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
