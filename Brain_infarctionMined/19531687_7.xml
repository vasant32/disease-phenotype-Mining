<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyse decompressive hemicraniectomy (DHC) in patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) with regard to infarction, haemorrhage or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DHC was performed in 43 of 787 patients with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified according to (1) primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> without and (2) with additional intracerebral haematoma, (3) secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> without rebleeding or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and (4) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> or (5) with rebleeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome was assessed according to the modified Rankin scale at 6 months RESULTS: Overall, 36 of 43 patients (83.7%) with DHC and 241 of 744 patients (32.4%) without DHC have been of a poor grade on admission (World Federation of Neurological Societies grading 4-5; p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Favourable outcome was achieved in 11 of 43 (25.6%) patients with DHC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in favourable outcome after primary (25%) versus secondary (26.1%) DHC (p = 1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> vs <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> vs <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>) revealed no difference in the rate of favourable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (p = 0.02) and clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> (p = 0.03) were significantly associated with unfavourable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that primary and secondary hemicraniectomy may be warranted, irrespective of the underlying aetiology-infarction, haemorrhage or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of intractable ICP to DHC seems to be crucial, rather than the time from SAH to DHC </plain></SENT>
