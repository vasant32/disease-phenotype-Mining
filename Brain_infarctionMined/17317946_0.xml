<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The postoperative course was uneventful until the patient suffered sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of consciousness disturbance 13 days after the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography showed no abnormality, but digital subtraction angiography revealed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> extending from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> neck to a point distal to the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thrombolysis was achieved by the infusion of urokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reconfiguration of the coil at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> neck was revealed compared with the initial configuration of the coil immediately after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging obtained after the thrombolysis showed hyperintense areas in the bilateral occipital lobes and thalami </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Periprocedural thromboembolic complications associated with coil embolization of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> are well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, delayed thromboembolic complications may occur in some patients after successful coil packing of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
