<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence suggests that cortical reorganisation in the unaffected hemisphere plays an important role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 59 year old man developed a small lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the left <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata, which then caused marked deterioration in a pre-existing left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> that had resulted from an earlier right putaminal haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional magnetic resonance imaging showed that the paretic left hand grip activated the ipsilateral left motor areas, but not the right hemispheric motor areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This suggests that partial recovery of the left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> had been brought about by cortical reorganisation of the left hemisphere and intensification of the uncrossed corticospinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The subsequent small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> may have damaged the uncrossed tract, thereby causing the pre-existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> to deteriorate even further </plain></SENT>
