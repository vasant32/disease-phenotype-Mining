<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies examining genetic associations with MRI-defined brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> have yielded inconsistent findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated genetic variation underlying covert MRI <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in persons without histories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of white participants in 6 studies comprising the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using 2.2 million genotyped and imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms, each study performed cross-sectional genome-wide association analysis of MRI <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> using age- and sex-adjusted logistic regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Study-specific findings were combined in an inverse-variance-weighted meta-analysis, including 9401 participants with mean age 69.7 (19.4% of whom had &gt;or=1 MRI <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most significant association was found with rs2208454 (minor allele frequency, 20%), located in intron 3 of MACRO domain containing 2 gene and in the downstream region of fibronectin leucine-rich transmembrane protein 3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each copy of the minor allele was associated with lower risk of MRI <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (odds ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.68-0.84; P=4.64x10(-7)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Highly suggestive associations (P&lt;1.0x10(-5)) were also found for 22 other single nucleotide polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium (r(2)&gt;0.64) with rs2208454 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association with rs2208454 did not replicate in independent samples of 1822 white and 644 black participants, although 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms within 200 kb from rs2208454 were associated with MRI <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the black population sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This first community-based, genome-wide association study on covert MRI <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> uncovered novel associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although replication of the association with top single nucleotide polymorphisms failed, possibly because of insufficient power, results in the black population sample are encouraging, and further efforts at replication are needed </plain></SENT>
