<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate whether FA could promote a neuroprotective effect by activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Totally 48 male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned into six groups (n = 8 in each group): animals in group <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion (I/R) only received 120-minute transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO); animals in group I/R + FA were administered FA (10 mg/kg) by caudal vein just after 120-minute tMCAO; animals in group I/R + FA + GW9662 were administered GW9662 (a PPAR-γ inhibitor, 1 mg/kg) intraperitoneally 30 minutes before <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and FA (10 mg/kg) by caudal vein just after 120-minute tMCAO; animals in group I/R + GW9662 were administered GW9662 (1 mg/kg) intraperitoneally 30 minutes before <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>; animals in group I/R + DMSO were administered 3% DMSO (vehicle of GW9662, 1 ml/kg) intraperitoneally 30 minutes before <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>; animals in sham group experienced the identical surgery apart from the insertion of the nylon filament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neurologic deficit score (NDS) were performed at 72 hours after reperfusion, and then mean brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume percentage (MBIVP) was determined with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) 10 g/L staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NDS was significantly increased in group I/R + FA (12.0 (10.0 - 15.0)), group I/R + FA + GW9662 (10.0 (8.0 - 12.0)), and in group I/R + FA + DMSO (12.0 (9.0 - 14.0)) at 72 hours after reperfusion compared with those in group I/R (7.5 (6.0 - 10.0)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NDS was conspicuously different between group I/R + FA (12.0 (10.0 - 15.0)) and group I/R + FA + GW9662 (10.0 (8.0 - 12.0)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MBIVP in group I/R ((45.82 - 8.83)%) was significantly greater than that in group I/R + FA ((23.52 - 9.90)%), group I/R + FA + GW9662 ((33.17 - 7.15)%); MBIVP in group I/R + FA ((23.52 - 9.90)%) was significantly smaller than that in group I/R + FA + GW9662 ((33.17 - 7.15)%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FA confers the neuroprotective effect on tMCAO in rats and the selective PPAR-γ <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> GW9662 attenuates the effect of FA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FA could promote a neuroprotective effect by, or in part, activation of PPAR-γ after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
