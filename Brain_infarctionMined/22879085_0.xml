<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is the risk of subsequent symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of the risk factors of SBI may help accurately predict those who will require treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods: This one-year retrospective study enrolled 199 adult healthy Taiwanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationships between baseline clinical factors and the presence of SBI during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: Fifteen (7.5%) healthy subjects had SBI, including 4.9% (5/103) males and 10.4% (10/96) females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that both mean age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were independently associated with SBI, such that any increase of one year in mean age increased the SBI rate by 7.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: In the present study, there is a close relationship between elderly patients and SBI and any increase of one year in mean age increases the SBI rate by 7.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aside from age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is by far the strongest modifiable risk factor identified to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prospective, longitudinal observational studies are warranted to evaluate the relationship between control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and SBI in this specific population to determine how to prevent subsequent symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
