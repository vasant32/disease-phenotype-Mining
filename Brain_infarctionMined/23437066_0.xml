<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Ischemic brain injury is associated with neuroinflammatory response, which essentially involves glial activation and neutrophil infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transcription factors nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) contribute to ischemic neuroinflammatory processes and secondary brain injury by releasing proinflammatory mediators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28499">Kaempferol</z:chebi>-3-O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26587">rutinoside</z:chebi> (KRS) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30200">kaempferol-3-O- glucoside</z:chebi> (KGS) are primary <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoids</z:chebi> found in Carthamus tinctorius L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent studies demonstrated that KRS protected against ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">Flavonoids</z:chebi> have been reported to have antiinflammatory properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Herein, we explored the effects of KRS and KGS in a transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 2 hours followed by 22 h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An equimolar dose of KRS or KGS was administered i.v. at the beginning of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results showed that KRS or KGS significantly attenuated the neurological deficits, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and neuron and axon injury, reflected by the upregulation of neuronal nuclear antigen-positive neurons and downregulation of amyloid precursor protein immunoreactivity in the ipsilateral ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, KRS and KGS inhibited the expression of OX-42, glial fibrillary acidic protein, phosphorylated STAT3 and NF-κB p65, and the nuclear content of NF-κB p65 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, these <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoids</z:chebi> inhibited the expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor α, interleukin 1β, intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1, matrix metallopeptidase 9, inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase, and myeloperoxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that postischemic treatment with KRS or KGS prevents ischemic brain injury and neuroinflammation by inhibition of STAT3 and NF-κB activation and has the therapeutic potential for the neuroinflammation-related diseases, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
