<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reliability of experimental model for localization and volume of ischemic lesion (basal ganglia, hippocampus, parietal-temporal regions; the volume of lesion focus on MRI T2-weighted image (T2-WI) in the first day after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> 146.4 +/- 44.7 mm3) has been worked out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted the clinical monitoring including assessment of neurological deficit, behavioral tests and performed MRI of the brain on 1st, 5th and 10-17th days after the occlusion of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), including regimes of diffusion-weighted image (DWI) and T2-WI, and carried out a histological study of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The regress of neurological deficit was seen on the 14th day after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Behavioral tests revealed the reduction of movement activity of animals in the case group 7 days after the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to the first day after surgery, the decrease of volume lesion focus on DWI and T2-WI was observed on the 5th day (p &lt; 0.05) as well, with the following decrease to the 10-14th days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The histological picture in the lesion foci corresponded to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> on the 5th and 14th days after surgery </plain></SENT>
