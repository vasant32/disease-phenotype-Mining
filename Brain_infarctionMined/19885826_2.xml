<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) is known to produce non-leaky and stable blood vessel formation mainly by the Tie2 receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we envisioned that the application of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein-Ang1 (COMP-Ang1), a soluble, stable, and potent form of Ang1, would promote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and provide a protective effect following unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To this end, we employed a 2-hour-MCAO model, and treated rats with adenovirus encoding COMP-Ang1 (Ade-COMP-Ang1) or control virus encoding beta-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">gal</z:chebi> (Ade-beta-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">gal</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Time course magnetic resonance images (MRIs) revealed significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the rats treated with Ade-COMP-Ang1 with an improvement of post-ischemic neurological deficits compared with rats treated with Ade-beta-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">gal</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, compared to the rats treated with Ade-beta-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">gal</z:chebi>, the rats treated with Ade-COMP-Ang1 showed an increase in blood vessels, especially in the border zone adjacent to the infarction, increased number of endogenous neuronal progenitor cells in the ischemic brain, and decreased number of TUNEL-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, COMP-Ang1 reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and consequently attenuated post-ischemic neurological deficits through <z:mp ids='MP_0005601'>enhanced angiogenesis</z:mp> and increased viable cell mass of neuronal cells </plain></SENT>
