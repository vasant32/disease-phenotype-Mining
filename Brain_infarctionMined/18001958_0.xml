<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Soft and unstable plaques represent a major risk for the patient, as they are correlated with an augmented probability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and emboli generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, the minimally-invasive characterization especially of this type of carotid plaques is crucial in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This paper presents an integrated system for the completely user-independent carotid plaque segmentation and characterization, based on ultrasound 2-D images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that using a ultrasound contrast agent, it is possible to segment also echolucent plaques with a percentage of misclassified pixels equal to 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After segmentation, the enhanced image is used to perform tissue characterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We tested our system on 5 echolucent plaques and on 5 fibrous/stable plaques, showing that our system is capable of an accurate carotid wall segmentation and proper quantification of the percentages of blood, fat, calcium and fibrous tissue constituting the plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The system is very promising and it is being used in a neurology unit on patients already indicated for endarterectomy, with the purpose of correlating its output with histology </plain></SENT>
