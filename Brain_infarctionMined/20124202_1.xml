<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the predictive value of cognitive test performance especially related to subcortico-frontal pathways, together with a cognitive screening test, for later incidence of fatal or nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A sample of 930 70-year-old men without previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> from the community-based Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men was investigated at baseline using Trail Making Tests (TMT) A and B and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During up to 13 years of follow-up, 166 men developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>; 105 participants had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Cox proportional hazards analyses adjusting for education, social group, and traditional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, a 1-SD increase in TMT-B time was associated with a higher risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (hazard ratio 1.48, 95% confidence interval 1.11-1.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was more than threefold higher in the highest (TMT-B = 146-240 s) compared to the lowest (TMT-B = 43-84 s) TMT-B quartile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TMT-A and MMSE results were not consistently related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Impaired performance in elderly men measured by Trail Making Test B, a cognitive test especially reflecting subcortico-frontal activities, was an independent predictor of subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in this community-based sample of elderly men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results extend previous findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> as an independent predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and indicate that the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> is increased already in the subclinical phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679466" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deficit</z:e> </plain></SENT>
