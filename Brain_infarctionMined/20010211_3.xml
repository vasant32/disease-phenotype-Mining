<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal data are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a population-based study we investigated this relationship both cross-sectionally and longitudinally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Brain MRIs were administered to 479 persons aged 60-90 years at baseline (1995-1996) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, white matter lesions and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> markers of vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At baseline and at follow-up examinations, we also identified persons with depressive symptoms and syndromes using the Center for Epidemiological Studies <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale and psychiatric interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Medical records were continuously monitored to identify incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was complete until October 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, 36 persons had depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, white matter lesions, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were associated with presence of depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 92 persons developed depressive symptoms, 35 of whom were categorized as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086133" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">depressive syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no association of any MRI marker with incident depressive symptoms or syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Markers of vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> cross-sectionally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, when these markers and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> were assessed longitudinally, no relationship was found </plain></SENT>
