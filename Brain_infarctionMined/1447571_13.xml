<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HMPAO SPECT was performed 2-15 days (median 4.5 days) after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Decreased HMPAO accumulation was detected in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SPECT studies revealed focal hypoperfusion corresponding to the clinical symptoms in 6 patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> or hemiataxia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conventional cranial CT disclosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in only 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Focal hypoperfusion was also found in 7 of 8 patients without clinical evidence of focal neurological deficits </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At follow-up examinations 3-45 weeks after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> disease, abnormalities revealed by HMPAO SPECT had improved or had even disappeared in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients studied </plain></SENT>
