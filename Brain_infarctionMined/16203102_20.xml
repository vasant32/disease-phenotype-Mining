<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study compared the effects of varying intensities and durations of endurance exercise using both motorized and voluntary running wheels after endothelin-I-induced focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, insulin-like growth factor I and synapsin-I were elevated in the ischemic hemisphere even in sedentary animals suggesting an intrinsic restorative response 2 weeks after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the sensorimotor cortex and the hippocampus of the intact hemisphere, one episode of moderate walking exercise, but not more intense running, resulted in the greatest increases in levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and synapsin-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exercise did not increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor, insulin-like growth factor I or synapsin-I in the ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In voluntary running animals, both brain and serum insulin-like growth factor I appeared to be intensity dependent and were associated with decreasing serum levels of insulin-like growth factor I and increasing hippocampal levels of insulin-like growth factor I in the ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This supports the notion that exercise facilitates the movement of insulin-like growth factor I across the blood-brain barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16827">corticosterone</z:chebi> levels were elevated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> exercise regimens and were highest in rats exposed to motorized running of greater speed or duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The elevation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16827">corticosterone</z:chebi> did not seem to alter the expression of the proteins measured, however, graduated exercise protocols may be indicated early after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that relatively modest exercise intervention can increase proteins involved in synaptic plasticity in areas of the brain that likely subserve motor relearning after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
