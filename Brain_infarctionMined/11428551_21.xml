<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have studied TNF-alpha levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum in 23 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients within the first 24 hours after ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, confirmed by computerized tomography of the brain (CT) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients the levels of TNF-alpha both in CSF and serum were significantly higher in comparison with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The positive correlation between the levels of TNF-alpha in CSF and serum of the studied patients has been observed </plain></SENT>
