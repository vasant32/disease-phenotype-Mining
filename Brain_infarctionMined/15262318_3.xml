<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6809">methamphetamine</z:chebi> (MP)-induced rotation test for the detection and quantification of extrapyramidal motor dysfunction induced by striatal infarction in gerbils after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mongolian gerbils (n=79) underwent the left common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (CCAO) for 10, 15, or 20 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous and MP-induced rotation tests were repeated postischemia, and the results compared with the extent of ischemic tissue injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The density of dopaminergic neurons immunostained with a tyrosine hydroxylase antibody in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) also was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological examination revealed selective neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of the hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) sector in 10-min CCAO animals, infarction confined to the striatum and hippocampal neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 15-min CCAO animals, and widespread hemispheric infarction in 20-min CCAO animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc were preserved in 10- and 15-min CCAO animals but were significantly reduced in 20-min CCAO animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In MP-induced rotation tests, 15-min CCAO animals showed biased rotation ipsilateral to the lesioned side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Biased rotation persisted 4 weeks postischemia, and the number of rotations significantly correlated with the regional infarction volume of the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-minute CCAO animals showed biased rotation contralateral to the lesioned side; rotation number was not correlated with the infarction volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results show that biased rotation behavior is a sensitive parameter of the extent of striatal injury after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> provided the lesion is not extended to the ipsilateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MP-induced rotation in rodents probably coordinates with the extrapyramidal motor dysfunction after striatal infarction in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>Parkinsonism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
