<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To our knowledge, there have been no reports focusing on differences of clinical characteristics according to two gross anatomic types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011672'>cardiac myxomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the differences of clinical features, coronary arteriographic findings, and histopathologic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients who underwent surgical excisions for left <z:mp ids='MP_0003392'>atrial myxomas</z:mp> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to the gross anatomic types, they were divided into two groups: group 1 having solid and ovoid <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxomas</z:mp> (n = 14), and group 2 having soft and papillary <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxomas</z:mp> (n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differences of presenting symptoms, prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, coronary angiographic findings, and histopathologic findings were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> was significantly higher in group 1 (78.6% vs 33.3%, p &lt; 0.05) than in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>That of neurologic symptoms was higher in group 2 (75% vs 14.3%, p &lt; 0.01) than in group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was higher in group 2 (75% vs 2.5%, p &lt; 0.05) than in group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On coronary angiography, an identification rate of clusters of tortuous vessels was higher in group 1 (81.8% vs 0%, p &lt; 0.01) than in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In histologic findings, most of group 1 tumors displayed many <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp>, small vessels, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in the stroma, but group 2 had few such structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Coronary angiographic findings of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-feeding arteries without clusters of tortuous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> vessels predict a <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxoma</z:mp> that is papillary in type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At that time, close attention should be given for the possible existence of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
