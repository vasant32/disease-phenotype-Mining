<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is a complex sequence of events including inflammatory reaction, for which the microglia appears to be a major cellular contributor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, whether post-ischemic activation of microglial cells has beneficial or detrimental effects remains to be elucidated, in particular on long term brain plasticity events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of our study was to determine, through modulation of post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp>, to what extent microglial cells are involved in some specific events of neuronal plasticity, neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since microglia is a source of neurotrophic factors, the identification of the brain-derived neurophic factor (BDNF) as possible molecular actor involved in these events was also attempted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a means of down-regulating the microglial response induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB, 90 mg/kg, i.p.) was used to inhibit the poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indeed, PARP-1 contributes to the activation of the transcription factor NF-kB, which is essential to the upregulation of proinflammatory genes, in particular responsible for microglial activation/proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Experiments were conducted in rats subjected to photothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> which leads to a strong and early microglial cells activation/proliferation followed by an infiltration of macrophages within the cortical lesion, events evaluated at serial time points up to 1 month post-ictus by immunostaining for OX-42 and ED-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our most striking finding was that the decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> microglial activation induced by 3-AB was associated with a long term down-regulation of two neuronal plasticity proteins expression, synaptophysin (marker of synaptogenesis) and GAP-43 (marker of neuritogenesis) as well as to a significant decrease in tissue BDNF production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, our data argue in favour of a supportive role for microglia in brain neuroplasticity stimulation possibly through BDNF production, suggesting that a targeted protection of microglial cells could represent an innovative approach to potentiate post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> neuroregeneration </plain></SENT>
