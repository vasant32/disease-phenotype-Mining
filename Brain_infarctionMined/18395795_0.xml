<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate whether EDP are detectable in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven first ever ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (mean age 61.5+/-10.8 years; age range 47-70 years; 12 women) were studied in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase (1-15 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) with clinical evaluations, radiological assessments, and the analysis of serum and CSF based on Western blot and ELISA for the detection and quantification of EDP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: None of the serum EDP concentrations are significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients compared with 25 healthy control individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, EDP levels in CSF are strongly (p&lt;0.0001) elevated compared with healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They correlated with total cholesterol (r=0.53; p=0.02), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (r=0.67; p=0.004) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (r=0.24; p=0.03), and with the interval between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and the time of lumbar puncture (r=0.35; p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EDPs are detectable in CSF of healthy subjects and patients with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
