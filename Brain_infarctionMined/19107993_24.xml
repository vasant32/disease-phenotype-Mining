<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To rely on the anatomical organization of the hippocampal formation in understanding whether and how late-life diseases such as <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> contribute to age-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to document brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and to generate high-resolution functional maps of the hippocampal formation in 240 community-based nondemented elders (mean age, 79.7 years) who received a comprehensive medical evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty participants had type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, whereas 74 had MRI-documented brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and the first analysis was designed to pinpoint hippocampal subregions differentially linked to each disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, guided by the results, additional functional MRI studies in aging rhesus monkeys and mice were used to test proposed mechanisms of dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although both <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were associated with hippocampal dysfunction, each was linked to separate hippocampal subregions, suggesting distinct underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hippocampal subregion linked to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> implicated blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> as a pathogenic mechanism, a hypothesis confirmed by imaging aging rhesus monkeys and a mouse model of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The hippocampal subregion linked to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> suggested transient hypoperfusion as a pathogenic mechanism, a hypothesis provisionally confirmed by comparing anatomical patterns across subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in different vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Taken together with previous findings, these results clarify how diseases of late life differentially target the hippocampal formation, identify elevations in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> as a contributing cause of age-related memory decline, and suggest specific interventions that can preserve cognitive health </plain></SENT>
