<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effects of an adenovirus-mediated Bcl-X(L) expression, driven by a neuron-specific human synapsin-1 promoter, on the degree of injury, were examined after transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, injections of vehicle, of an adenoviral E1-deleted control vector (Ad-dE1), or a Bcl-X(L) vector (Ad-Syn-Bcl-X(L)) were stereotactically made in the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven days later, focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced either by 30 min or 2 h of intraluminal thread occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In line with previous data, 30 min of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion reproducibly resulted in disseminated neuronal injury of the striatum, as revealed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi> and TUNEL 3 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The degree of cell injury was significantly reduced in Ad-Syn-Bcl-X(L) treated as compared with Ad-dE1 and vehicle-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, 2 h of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion produced reproducible <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> both in vehicle and Ad-dE1 treated animals 24 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area at the level of the striatum was significantly decreased by Ad-Syn-Bcl-X(L) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present data demonstrate that an adenoviral Bcl-X(L) expression with a neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter provides a powerful tool, which not only diminishes disseminated neuronal injury, but also protects against tissue infarction </plain></SENT>
