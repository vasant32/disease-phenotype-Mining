<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analysed changes in lectin-stained cells on the 1st, 3rd, 7th or 14th day after transient global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three areas differing in the degree of microglial reaction were selected for analysis: the upper cerebral cortex, the hippocampal CA1 area, and the hilus of the dentate gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine morphological parameters, including fractal dimension, lacunarity, self-similarity range, solidity, convexity and form factor were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then the resultant data were processed using principal component analysis (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that the two first principal components together explained more than 73% of the observed variability, and may be sufficient both to describe the morphological diversity of the cells, and to determine the dynamics and direction of the changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both hippocampal areas, the transformation to hypertrophied and phagocytic cells was observed, but changes in the hilus were faster than in the CA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in the cortex, a microglial reaction was characterised by an increase in the complexity of processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results presented show that the quantitative morphological analysis can be an effective tool in research on the reactive behaviour of microglia and, particularly, in the detection of small and early changes in the cells </plain></SENT>
