<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Emerging evidences suggest that canonical Notch signaling may be involved in ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that EA pretreatment-induced tolerance against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is mediated by Notch signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EA pretreatment significantly enhanced Notch1, Notch4 and Jag1 gene transcriptions in the striatum, except Notch1 intracellular domain level, which could be increased evidently by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion, Hes1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and Notch1 intracellular domain level in ischemic striatum in EA pretreatment group were increased and reached the peak at 2 h and 24 h, respectively, which were both earlier than the peak achieved in control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intraventricular injection with the Î³-secretase inhibitor MW167 attenuated the neuroprotective effect of EA pretreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EA pretreatment induces the tolerance against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> through activation of canonical Notch pathway </plain></SENT>
