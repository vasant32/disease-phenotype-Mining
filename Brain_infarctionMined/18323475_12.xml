<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the association of MetS with the prevalence of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, periventricular hyperintensity, and subcortical white matter lesions in healthy adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in 1151 Japanese healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three types of silent lesions were assessed by MRI scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MetS was diagnosed using the criteria by the National Cholesterol Education Adult Treatment Panel III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjusting for age and other factors, MetS was significantly associated with silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, periventricular hyperintensity and subcortical white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the MetS components, elevated blood pressure was commonly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Dyslipidemia</z:e> and elevated fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were associated with subcortical white matter lesions and periventricular hyperintensities, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Positive trends were observed between the number of MetS components and prevalence of silent lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MetS is associated with the prevalence of silent lesions independent of other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The clustering of MetS components tends to increase the prevalence of silent lesions </plain></SENT>
