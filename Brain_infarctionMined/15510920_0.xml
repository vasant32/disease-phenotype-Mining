<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> is a useful outcome measure in clinical studies and intervention trials because it reflects early stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study examined the relationship between common carotid artery intima-media thickness and ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The present study examined the association between CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and its subtypes in 75 cases and 21 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases with internal borderzone infarction (IBI) were consecutively recruited and classified into subtypes using CT and Bamford's classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It classifies <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> regarding vascular territory using clinical features to determine the size and site of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These subtypes included: total anterior circulation infarctions (TACIs), partial anterior circulation infarctions (PACIs), posterior circulation infarctions (POCIs), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> (LACIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Controls were recruited among individuals hospitalized at the same institution and matched for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients and control subjects underwent B-mode ultrasonographic measurements of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> of the far wall of both common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 75 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, 10 (14%) were classified as TACIs, 34 (45%) had PACIs, 12 (16%) had POCIs and 19 (25%) had LACIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was higher in investigation group (1.03+/-0.18 mm) than in controls (0.85+/-0.18 mm; p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The difference in CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> between investigation group and controls was significant and the relation between CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and IBI remained unchanged after adjustments of main <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Regarding the subtypes of IBI, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> values were significantly higher in patients with TACIs and PACIs versus those with LACIs and POCIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An increased CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was established in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subtypes of IBI and was significantly higher in those with anterior circulation infarctions versus posterior circulation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This study points to importance of noninvasive measurement of CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> with ultrasonographic techniques as a diagnostic tool for selecting patients at high risk for IBI and identifying different subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
