<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We evaluated electrophysiological benefits of reperfusion following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats received either transient proximal occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery for 30 (Group I, n=8) or 90 minutes (Group II, n=8) or permanent thermocoagulation of the distal right middle cerebral artery (Group III, n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurobehavioral outcome and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) were examined before and at 7 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain infarction</z:e> was assessed after the rats were euthanized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, stable SSEPs were consistently recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 7 days post-insult, Group III (permanent occlusion) had the greatest reduction in the SSEPs recorded ipsilaterally and contralaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Groups I and II (transient ischemic groups) also had depressant SSEPs recorded from the ipsilateral ischemic and the contralateral intact brain (electrophysiological diaschisis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> resulted in greater <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and increased neurological deficits in addition to greater reductions in the ipsilateral and the contralateral SSEPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early reperfusion facilitates the electrophysiological recovery in both ipsilateral lesional and the contralateral intact brain, which may be closely relevant to post-injury brain rewiring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated that contralateral electrophysiological diaschisis could be greatly reversed by early reperfusion and is independent of the lesion size of striatum </plain></SENT>
