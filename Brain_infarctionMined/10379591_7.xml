<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To compare these techniques, we examined 53 patients within 6 h of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, using a standardised MRI protocol including fast-FLAIR and 3D time-of-flight TOF <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> to detect vessel occlusion or reduced flow corresponding to the suspected ischaemic territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were confirmed on MRI after 1-5 days in 41 cases (77%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall accuracy of 3D-TOF MRA was 68% and sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 67%, 71%, 87%, and 43% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Values for the fast-FLAIR sequence were: 65%, 85%, 93% and 44%, with an overall accuracy of 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fast-FLAIR sequence was thus able to show occluded vessels or reduced flow with about the same accuracy as 3D-TOF MRA and enabled better prediction of the ischaemic area </plain></SENT>
