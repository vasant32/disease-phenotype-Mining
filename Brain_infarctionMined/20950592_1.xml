<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Various studies on focal cerebral ischemic models have implicated the direct activation and expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), especially MMP-9, as a key orchestrator of blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) disruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, studies have shown that MMP-9 siRNA can protect the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective role of a lentivirus vector-mediated mmp-9shRNA following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>--specifically assessing whether LV-mmp9shRNA silencing of MMP-9 mRNA could ameliorate <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption and in turn reduce vascular permeability, neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and neurobehavioral deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment was given 2 weeks prior to surgery using a lentivirus-mediated vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgery was conducted using the established middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model in rats, while outcomes were measured 24 h after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrated a significant reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> volume, brain water content, and neurobehavioral deficits following LV-mmp9shRNA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, Evans blue and IgG extravasation were reduced, MMP-9 mRNA expression was silenced, and Western blot analysis revealed a decreased expression of MMP-9 and VEGF with an increased expression of occludin and collagen IV in brain tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that successful delivery of LV-mmp9shRNA may ameliorate ischemic brain injury by preserving structural integrity and improving functional outcome </plain></SENT>
