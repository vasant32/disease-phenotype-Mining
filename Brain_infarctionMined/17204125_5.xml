<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and diagnostic features of the canine sensorimotor syndrome caused by striatocapsular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> (SCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ANIMALS STUDIED: Six dogs with diagnostic imaging or postmortem evidence of SCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURES: Medical records of dogs with SCI were retrospectively reviewed and the signalment, history, clinical signs, antemortem clinicopathologic test results, diagnostic imaging findings, case outcomes, and pathologic findings recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> dogs had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003680'>nonprogressive</z:hpo> homonymous visual field deficits and contralateral general proprioceptive (GP) deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and facial hypalgesia were noted in 5/6 dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CT scans were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 2/4 dogs, and revealed poorly defined hypoattenuating lesions in the subcortical white matter in two dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRI exams were performed in 5/6 dogs and revealed unilateral, variably sized, striatocapsular lesions consistent with nonhemorrhagic infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic imaging (6/6) and postmortem examinations (2/6) suggested that SCI resulted from lesions in the vascular territories of the rostral choriodal (6/6) and lenticulostriate arteries (2/6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diseases predisposing to infarction were not identified in 5/6 dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Improvements in mentation, behavior, proprioceptive deficits, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> were seen in surviving dogs, but persistent, symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748618" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory deficits</z:e> were noted during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SCI should be considered as a differential diagnosis for dogs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003680'>nonprogressive</z:hpo> homonymous hemianopia, contralateral GP deficits or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, and facial hypalgesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MRI is the preferred modality for the antemortem imaging diagnosis of SCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although partial recovery occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> surviving dogs, visual and facial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152027" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory disturbances</z:e> persisted </plain></SENT>
