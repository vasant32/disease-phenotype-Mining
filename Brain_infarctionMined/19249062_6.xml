<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From March to October 2006, 14 consecutive patients with PICA territory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarctions</z:e> (brainstem spared) diagnosed by brain MRI from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry at the Keimyung University Dongsan Medical Center were enrolled within 12 days of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (mean 4.0 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Otolith function tests included ocular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> (OT), skew deviation, and subjective visual vertical (SVV) were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The extent of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> was determined by previously validated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> anatomical templates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had an <z:mp ids='MP_0001504'>abnormal posture</z:mp> as a result of otolithic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (79%) had at least one otolith-related test abnormality: abnormal tilt of SVV (79%), abnormal OT (29%), or skew deviation (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two common patterns of otolith dysfunction were identified based on whether or not the nodulus was infarcted: 1) ipsilesional SVV tilt (mean 5.0 degrees at binocular viewing) without accompanying abnormal OT or skew deviation (nodulus spared); 2) contralesional SVV tilt (mean 11.3 degrees at binocular viewing) with concomitant abnormal OT and skew deviation (nodulus infarcted) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 1 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (i.e., nodulus spared) fell toward the side of lesion while patients with type 2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (i.e., nodulus infracted) fell toward the opposite side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Isolated PICA territory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> usually produces two distinct patterns of otolith dysfunction - Ipsilesional SVV tilt and falling without accompanying OT or skew deviation if the nodulus is spared and contralesional SVV tilt and falling with OT and skew deviation if nodulus is infarcted </plain></SENT>
