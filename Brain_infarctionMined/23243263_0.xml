<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Histological evidence is considered the only proof of primary central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (PCNSV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, brain biopsy is often omitted or delayed because of the invasiveness and possible complications of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Circulating endothelial cells (CEC) were shown to be elevated in patients with active antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesise that CEC are also elevated in patients with active PCNSV and may contribute to the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CEC were assessed in 18 patients, 3 of whom had biopsy-proven PCNSV and 15 clinical, cerebrospinal fluid and imaging data, highly suggestive of PCNSV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 3 of these 15 patients CEC assessment was performed after initiation of successful immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CEC numbers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were compared to those of 16 healthy volunteers and 123 subjects with cerebrovascular risk factors and/or ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, who had been studied in our group before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CEC were assessed by immunomagnetic isolation from peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients with proven and suspected active PCNSV, CEC were extremely elevated (&gt;400 cells/ml in most of the patients) and significantly higher than in healthy and disease controls (pâ‰¤0.01 for each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CEC significantly decreased with immunosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For the first time it is shown that CEC are significantly elevated in patients with active PCNSV in contrast to other pathologies associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and correlate with disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity of the method for diagnosing PCNSV and the use of the method for treatment monitoring should be addressed in future prospective studies with a larger patient group </plain></SENT>
