<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Golgi apparatus (GA) of the large pyramidal motor neurons in the cerebral cortex (Betz cells), was examined in sixteen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0007354'>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</z:hpo> (ALS), in one patient with familial ALS (FALS), and in ten non-ALS age matched controls including one patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington's disease</z:e> and one patient with a brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The GA was immunostained with an antibody against the MG-160 protein, a conserved sialoglycoprotein of the medial cisternae of the organelle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In ALS, 13.2% of counted Betz cells had fragmented GA in contrast to 0.6% in the ten non-ALS controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fragmentation of the GA of Betz cells was identical to that previously reported in spinal cord motor neurons from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> ALS and in transgenic mice expressing the G93A mutation of the gene encoding the Cu/Zn <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The striking morphological similarity between the fragmentation of the GA observed in Betz cells and in spinal cord motor neurons suggests that a similar pathogenic mechanism is responsible for both, and that the fragmentation of the GA of the spinal cord motor neurons is not a consequence of deafferentation due to the degeneration of the Betz cells </plain></SENT>
