<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been localized in neurons and astrocytes in the cerebral cortex and the white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that glial ANP may contribute to the regulation of cerebral blood flow in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to elucidate this possible role, the immunohistochemistry of ANP was studied in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and in other cases of brain trauma for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant increase in the number of ANP-immunoreactive glial cells (mainly astrocytes) was observed in the white matter surrounding the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> compared with the intact area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant increase in ANP-immunoreactive glial cell number was observed in the cerebral white matter from brain haemorrhage, <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp> and control cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that glial ANP may increase in number in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, and that it may be involved in the regulation of the cerebral blood flow in the infarcted area </plain></SENT>
