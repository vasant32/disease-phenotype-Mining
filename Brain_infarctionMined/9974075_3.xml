<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our study was to use functional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging to determine whether reorganization of brain function occurs in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010636'>schizencephaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010636'>schizencephaly</z:hpo> (three right-handed, one ambidextrous) presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Associated lesions included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001274'>agenesis of the corpus callosum</z:hpo> (n = 1) and absence of the septum pellucidum (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was performed in each patient using a single-section fast low-angle shot (FLASH) blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) technique at 1.5 T in a standard head coil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The motor cortex was initially identified on an axial T1-weighted anatomic image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty consecutive images were obtained during a motor task consisting of repetitive finger-to-thumb opposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percentage of change in increased signal intensity was calculated for the primary motor area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An ipsilateral activation index was used to compare the affected with the unaffected hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The percentage of change in increased signal intensity in the area of activation ranged from 4.8% +/- 0.9 to 9.2% +/- 1.2 (mean, 5.6% +/- 1.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ipsilateral activation index in the affected hemisphere was 0.00 to 0.38, whereas that in the unaffected hemisphere was 15.4 to infinity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The difference in the ipsilateral activation index between each hemisphere was considered significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results showed increased activation in the unaffected hemisphere in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010636'>schizencephaly</z:hpo>, which may reflect functional reorganization of the motor area in patients with this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
