<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> is among the mechanisms that may explain the association of <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> (BP) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few data are available on the longitudinal association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the longitudinal association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, BP, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi> with change in parenchymal cerebral blood flow (pCBF) in 575 patients with manifest atherosclerotic disease (mean age, 57 Â± 10 years) from the SMART-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total CBF was measured at baseline and at follow-up with magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) angiography and was expressed per 100ml brain volume as an indicator of cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Automated brain segmentation was used to quantify brain tissue volumes and cerebrospinal fluid on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean (standard deviation [SD]) baseline pCBF was 52.3 (9.8) ml/min/100ml and after 3.9 years (range, 3.0-5.8 years) of follow-up declined to 50.7 (10.3) ml/min/100ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, follow-up time, and vascular risk showed that untreated and poorly controlled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and higher levels of systolic and diastolic BP (per SD) were significantly associated with a decline in pCBF; mean differences in decline (95% confidence interval) were -2.2 (-4.4 to 0.0), -1.0 (-1.8 to -0.1), and -1.0 (-1.8 to -0.2) ml/min/100ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, within hypertensive patients (n = 469), patients using angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) did not show a decline in pCBF, whereas patients using other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi> did show a decline in pCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, poorly controlled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and high BP levels are associated with a decline in pCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, treatment with ARBs might result in less decline in pCBF than other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
