<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Sorbin and SH3-domain-containing-1 (SORBS1) is an important adaptor protein in insulin-signalling pathway, and its genetic polymorphism may regulate the activity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association between the SORBS1 T228A polymorphism and ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genotyping was achieved by a rapid-cycle PCR and melting curve analysis using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39442">fluorescent probes</z:chebi> in 1049 incident cases of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 1049 age- and sex-matched control subjects recruited from the Hisayama study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The allele distributions of the SORBS1 T228A polymorphism were similar amongst cases and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The multivariate-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of the AA genotype for ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 2.897 (95% CI, 0.907-8.018) compared with the TT genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In terms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype, there was a trend toward a difference in the AA genotypes for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e>, compared with the TT genotype (OR = 8.740, P = 0.0510), and combined TT and TA genotypes (OR = 8.768, P = 0.0505) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other polymorphisms genotyped were not associated with any subtypes of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>T228A polymorphism of SORBS1 was not associated with the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The AA genotype of SORBS1 T228A polymorphism may play a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> in the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
