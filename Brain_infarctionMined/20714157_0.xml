<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Demonstrating the precise anatomical area of the internal border zone (IB) by brain imaging has been unclear, and it is not well known which relevant arteries are associated with IB infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with IB infarctions were selected from 748 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The IB infarctions were identified by coronal diffusion-weighted imaging, excluding lesions over the upper pole of the lateral ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The angiographic findings of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), on contrast-enhanced MRA, were evaluated in the patients with and without IB infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty patients met the criteria for an IB infarction: 7 had <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> steno-occlusion without ICA disease, and 23 had ICA steno-occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one patients had ICA steno-occlusion without IB infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The multiple logistic regression analysis showed that a more than moderate degree of steno-occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was a significant factor (OR, 11.32; p = 0.006) associated with IB infarction; whereas that of the ICA was not significant (OR, 2.19; p = 0.298) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that IB infarctions were associated with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> steno-occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ICA disease resulting in IB infarctions would be expected to have significant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> steno-occlusion causing hemodynamic compromise </plain></SENT>
