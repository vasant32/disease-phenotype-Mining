<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study included eight patients who presented with content-specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0000746'>delusions</z:hpo> after right caudate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and an equal number of matched controls, without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000746'>delusions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared to controls, patients with caudate lesions performed less well on tests of memory, abstract reasoning, and frontal executive functions, and had significantly reduced metabolism in the inferior prefrontal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients suggest an etiological relationship between alterations in inferior prefrontal functions and the development of content-specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0000746'>delusions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
