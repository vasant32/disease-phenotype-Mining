<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background and Purpose: Despite recent studies on risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, it is still unclear whether certain risk factors differently affect different levels of cerebral arteries in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We attempted to study risk factors and lifestyle factors in patients with cerebrovascular diseases affecting different levels of the cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: We studied 343 Korean patients (222 men and 121 women) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Strokes</z:hpo> were subdivided into large vessel infarction (LVI, n = 156), small vessel infarction (SVI, n = 105), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>, n = 82) according to modified TOAST criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with cardiogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264978" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic infarction</z:e>, undetermined causes, and miscellaneous causes were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the patients with LVI and SVI, 104 and 49 underwent angiographic studies, respectively, who were designated as having definite LVI and definite SVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Definite LVI was further subdivided into proximal LVI when the internal carotid artery (n = 25), vertebral artery (n = 13) or basilar artery (n = 14) were primarily involved, and distal LVI when the middle cerebral artery (n = 35), anterior cerebral artery (n = 7) or posterior cerebral artery (n = 10) were involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using a structured interview, we assessed the risk factors and lifestyles: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM), cigarette smoking (CS), alcohol consumption, physical activity and exercise, and the amount of consumption of salt, vegetables, fat, fish and fruits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum cholesterol, body mass index and total body fat were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results: Multivariate analysis showed that in men, DM was a discriminant factor favoring <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (BI) over <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>, definite LVI or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> and proximal LVI over <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Decreased fruit intake differentiated distal LVI from definite SVI, and distal LVI from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In women, DM and abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> differentiated BI from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>, while DM favored definite LVI over <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>, proximal LVI over <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> and definite SVI over <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis including sex as a separate variate showed that DM was a factor favoring BI over <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>, definite LVI over <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>, proximal LVI over <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>, distal LVI over <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> and definite SVI over <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CS was a factor favoring BI over <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>, while heavy CS was a factor discriminating distal LVI from definite SVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Male sex was a factor favoring definite LVI over <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> and proximal LVI over <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A lesser amount of fruit consumption favored definite SVI over distal LVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that DM in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sexes and central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in women are factors discriminating BI from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, these factors as well as others were not found to discriminate the sizes of the vessels involved in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, except that being male may be a factor favoring proximal large vessel disease over <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Genetic factors or other not yet identified risk factors may be responsible for the differences in the subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> among different ethnic populations </plain></SENT>
