<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify a gene(s) susceptible to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, we performed a large-scale association study of Japanese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, using 52608 gene-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparison of allele frequencies between 1112 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and age- and sex-matched control subjects of the same number found an SNP in the 5'-flanking region of angiotensin receptor like-1 (AGTRL1) gene (rs9943582, - 154G/A) to have a significant association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> [odds ratio = 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.14-1.47, P = 0.000066] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also found the binding of Sp1 transcription factor to the region including the susceptible G allele, but not the non-susceptible A allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Luciferase assay and RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that exogenously introduced Sp1 induced transcription of AGTRL1 and its ligand, apelin, as well, indicating direct regulation of apelin/APJ pathway by Sp1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a 14 year follow-up cohort study in a Japanese community in Hisayama town, Japan revealed that the homozygote of the susceptible G allele of this particular SNP had significantly higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (hazard ratio = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.22-3.29, P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the SNP in the AGTRL1 gene is associated with the susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
