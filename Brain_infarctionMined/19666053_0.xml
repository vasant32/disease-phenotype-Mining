<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We developed a novel trans-femoral artery approach to the rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model (TF-MCAO) without sacrificing the external carotid artery (ECA) with/without the pterygopalatine artery, which is important for chewing food </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To make the TF-MCAO we first dissect the left common carotid artery (CCA), ECA, and internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transient occlusion clips are applied to the proximal ECA and the pterygopalatine artery; we never sacrifice the ECA branch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 24-gage catheter is inserted into the left femoral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We insert a slightly bent 0.014in. hydrophilically coated guide wire via a haemostasis valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anatomically, the left common carotid artery is located rostral to the descending aorta, permitting a straight-forward, blind approach to the CCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The guide wire is gently advanced about 17mm from the bifurcation of the CCA until slight resistance is encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The guide wire and temporary occlusion clips are withdrawn after 90min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rats were sacrificed 24h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eleven rats were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One rat died before occlusion due to deep anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The success rate for producing infarction was 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean infarction volume of the basal ganglia was 94.4mm(3)+/-9.4 se and mean infarction volume of the cerebral cortex was 124.2mm(3)+/-21.6 se </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No rat died due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and no rat suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We conclude that TF-MCAO was useful for producing a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
