<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Electrical stimulation of the cortex (CS) during rehabilitative training (CS/RT) augments motor map plasticity and confers gains in motor function beyond those observed with motor rehabilitation alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is unclear how the distribution of electrical stimulation across the cortex accomplishes these changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study examined the behavioral and neurophysiological effects of delivering CS/RT through a distributed versus focal arrangement of electrical contacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male rats were given rehabilitative training on a skilled forelimb reaching task following induction of focal ischemic damage within motor cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intracortical microstimulation was used to derive high-resolution maps of forelimb movement representations within motor cortex contralateral to the trained/impaired paw before and after rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals that received rehabilitation showed greater increases in motor map area and reaching accuracy than animals that received no training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Animals with the distributed configuration performed significantly greater reaching accuracy than animals in both the CS/RT with focused contact arrangement and rehabilitative training alone (RT) conditions on days 3 to 4 and on day 6 through the remainder of the study (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, both CS/RT groups exhibited larger motor maps than the RT condition (E1-CS/RT, 4.71 ± 0.66 mm(2); E2-CS/RT, 4.64 ± 0.46 mm(2); RT, 2.99 ± 0.28 mm(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results indicate that although both focal and distributed forms of CS/RT promote motor map reorganization only the distributed form of CS/RT enhances motor performance with rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
