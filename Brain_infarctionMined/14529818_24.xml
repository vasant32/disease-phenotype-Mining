<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies were undertaken to develop a reproducible murine model of perinatal hypoxic-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (HIE) which would permit both anatomic and neurofunctional quantification of injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Short-term neurofunctional outcomes consisted of three developmental reflexes (righting, cliff aversion and geotaxis) assessed in 7-day-old mouse pups 24 h after unilateral carotid artery ligation followed by inhalation of 8% oxygen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was dependent on duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, being approximately 2.5-fold greater with longer (60 min) versus shorter (30 min) <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> exposure (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three sensorimotor neonatal reflexes assessed at 24 h after HIE injury correlated significantly with long-term neurofunction evaluated using a water-maze test of navigational learning and memory assessed 8 weeks later in the same animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>Cerebral atrophy</z:hpo>, a delayed consequence of HIE in this model, also correlated strongly with water-maze performance (r=0.86, P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate for the first time that murine neonatal sensorimotor reflex performance can be rigorously quantified in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of perinatal HIE and has strong predictive value not only for anatomic extent of cerebral injury, but also for long-term neurofunctional outcome </plain></SENT>
