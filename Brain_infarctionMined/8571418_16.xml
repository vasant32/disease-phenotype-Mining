<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recently, asymmetries have been demonstrated in skin sudomotor and vasomotor function after unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was performed to determine whether other bedside tests reflecting sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiovascular functions would reveal differences with respect to the side of cerebrovascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Heart rate variability during deep breathing as well as blood pressure and heart rate changes during tilt and isometric handgrip was measured in a group of patients with a monofocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and compared with similar data from age-matched patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> and healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and with the control subjects, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> location on the right side was associated with a reduced respiratory heart rate variability (P &gt; .01), a reflex mainly under parasympathetic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, reflexes mainly reflecting peripheral sympathetic function were equal for right- and left-sided lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Since an imbalance in cardiac autonomic innervation may be crucial for the generation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and since <z:mp ids='MP_0005333'>reduced heart rate</z:mp> variability has been associated with increased mortality, the findings suggest that the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> may be correlated with lateralization and location of the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
