<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nine brain autopsy cases of small old cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were selected for neuropathological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight of the patients had cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, in two cases with extension into the striate body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In one case the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> involved the striate body only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The density of neurons and glial cells was measured in the coronal and the horizontal planes at various distances from the margin of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Corresponding counting points in the contralateral hemisphere served as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On light microscopy, the infarcted cortex was irregularly shaped, but on serial sections the bulging parts appeared to be cut off from the infarcted tissue ("pseudo-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> islands") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The zone of transition from infarcted to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain tissue was less than a few mm wide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one patient, tomographic measurements of the cerebral blood flow (CBF) and a CT scan could be compared with the neuropathological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this patient, CBF in the surroundings of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was decreased despite a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neuronal density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The study supports the traditional view held by pathologists that a sharp transition exists between infarcted and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain tissue and suggests that the hypoperfusion zone surrounding the region of complete infarction may be due to mechanisms other than selective loss of neurons </plain></SENT>
