<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to determine the influence of a single dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi> on the cerebral motor activation of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients in the early phase of recovery, we conducted a prospective, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study on 8 patients with pure motor hemiparesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each patient underwent two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) examinations: one under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi> and one under placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first was performed 2 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and the second a week later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the two fMRI examinations, patients performed an active controlled motor task with the affected hand and a passive one conducted by the examiner with the same hand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Motor performance was evaluated by motor tests under placebo and under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi> immediately before the examinations to investigate the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi> on motor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi>, during the active motor task, hyperactivation in the ipsilesional primary motor cortex was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi> significantly improved motor skills of the affected side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that a single dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi> was enough to modulate cerebral sensory-motor activation in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This redistribution of activation toward the motor cortex output activation was associated with an enhancement of motor performance </plain></SENT>
