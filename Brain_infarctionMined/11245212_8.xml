<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in this enzyme are associated with the classic late-infantile form of neuronal ceroid <z:mp ids='MP_0008842'>lipofuscinosis</z:mp> (CLN2), an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> disorder leading to severe brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To gain more insight into CLN2 pathogenesis and the role of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35033,52279,9532">TPP</z:chebi> I in human tissues in general, we analyzed the temporal and spatial distribution of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35033,52279,9532">TPP</z:chebi> I in the brain and its localization in internal organs under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathological conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35033,52279,9532">TPP</z:chebi> I immunoreactivity appears in neurons late in gestation and increases gradually in the postnatal period, matching significantly the final differentiation and maturation of neural tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endothelial cells, choroid plexus, microglial cells, and ependyma showed <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35033,52279,9532">TPP</z:chebi> I immunostaining distinctly earlier than neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Acquisition of the adult pattern of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35033,52279,9532">TPP</z:chebi> I distribution in the brain at around the age of 2 years correlates with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of clinical signs in CLN2 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In adults, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35033,52279,9532">TPP</z:chebi> I was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of cells in the brain and internal organs we studied, although the intensity of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35033,52279,9532">TPP</z:chebi> I labeling varied among several types of cells and showed a noticeable predilection for cells and/or organs associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25905">peptide hormone</z:chebi> and neuropeptide production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35033,52279,9532">TPP</z:chebi> I immunoreactivity was increased in aging brain, neurodegenerative and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085078" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lysosomal storage disorders</z:e>, and some differentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and was reduced in ischemic/anoxic areas and undifferentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35033,52279,9532">TPP</z:chebi> I is involved in general protein turnover and that its expression may be controlled by various regulatory mechanisms, which highlights the importance of this enzyme for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> function of cells and organs in humans </plain></SENT>
