<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Delta opioid <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> [D-ala2,D-leU5]enkephalin (DADLE) induces hibernation in summer ground squirrels, and enhances preservation and survival of isolated or transplanted lungs and hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the protective effect of DADLE in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with DADLE (4 mg/kg every 2 h x 4 injections, i.p.) or saline prior to unilateral occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Daily behavioral tests revealed that ischemic animals treated with DADLE did not show any significant behavioral dysfunctions compared with saline-treated ischemic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Opioid <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> only transiently inhibited the protective effect of DADLE, indicating the participation of non-opioid mechanisms in DADLE neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological examination using triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) revealed that brains from ischemic animals treated with DADLE, either alone or with adjuvant opioid blockers, exhibited almost completely intact striata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, brains from ischemic animals that received saline showed significant infarction in the lateral striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analyses of apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> revealed a significant increase in the p-53 mRNA expression in the striatum of ischemic animals that received saline, while those that received DADLE exhibited near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> striatal p-53 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This protective effect was accompanied by significant increments in protein levels of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor in the striatum of DADLE-treated ischemic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results indicate that DADLE protected against necrotic and apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> processes associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrates that delta opioids are crucially involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, suggesting that the opioid system is important in the study of brain injury and protection </plain></SENT>
