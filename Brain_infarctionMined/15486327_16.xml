<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Alberta <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is a grading system to assess ischemic changes on CT in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CT angiography-source images (CTA-SI) predict final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined whether the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> ASPECTS and clinical outcome were more related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> CTA-SI ASPECTS than to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> noncontrast CT (NCCT) ASPECTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ASPECTS was assigned by 2 raters on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> NCCT, CTA-SI, and follow-up imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean baseline ASPECTS of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> NCCT and CTA-SI was compared with the follow-up ASPECTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rate ratios (RRs) were used to quantify the relationship between the dichotomized baseline ASPECTS (categorized as 0 to 7 versus 8 to 10) and favorable patient outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Proximal occlusion (internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery) was seen in 62%, M2 occlusion in 18%, and no occlusion was seen in 20% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median time between symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and imaging was 1.9 (1.2 to 2.5) hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly larger difference of 1.4 between the mean baseline NCCT and CTA-SI ASPECTS in patients who had more ischemic changes (follow-up ASPECTS=0 to 3) than a difference of 0.6 in patients who had near-to-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CT scans (follow-up ASPECTS=8 to 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rate of favorable outcome for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> NCCT ASPECTS of 8 to 10 was 51.8% versus 25.0% for 0 to 7 (RR, 2.1, 95% CI: 0.7 to 5.9, P=0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> CTA-SI ASPECTS of 8 to 10, the rate of favorable outcome was 58.8% versus 31.8% for 0 to 7 (RR, 1.8, 95% CI: 0.9 to 3.8, P=0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CTA-SI ASPECTS provides added information in the prediction of final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
