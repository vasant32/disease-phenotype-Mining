<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abnormally contrast material-enhanced curvilinear structures were demonstrated in eight patients in the evolving area of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/infarction within 26 hours after the ictus on contrast-enhanced, high-field-strength (1.5-T), T1-weighted spin-echo images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The abnormal enhancement is considered to represent cortical arterial vessels of markedly slowed circulation in areas of underlying brain injury, which will eventually progress to frank <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was demonstrated at computed tomographic (CT) and follow-up <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Characteristically, the degree of the contrast enhancement of vessels appeared most intense in the proximal portions, and the intensity of enhancement gradually diminished in the more distal portions of these vessels as they pass over the convexities and finally disappear </plain></SENT>
