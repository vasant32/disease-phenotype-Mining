<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Tau-immunoreactive astrocytes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSNP1">progressive supranuclear palsy</z:e> (PSP) have a distinctive <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and are referred to as tufted astrocytes (TA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that TA may be a degenerative change in reactive astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis we examined the relationship of TA to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> in PSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We first examined the distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> [glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes], TA, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo> (NFT) and pretangles in brain sections of neuropathologically pure PSP cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Second, we examined PSP cases complicated by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, since these cases would have reactive astrocytes associated with lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used double immunostaining for GFAP and tau for cases with vascular lesions, and triple immunostaining for GFAP, tau and beta-amyloid protein for sections with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>senile plaques</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> and TA, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> prominent in globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus, and TA prominent in motor cortex and striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> paralleled the distribution of NFT, but not the distribution of pretangles, suggesting that NFT contributes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> in PSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although reactive astrocytes were present around <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>senile plaques</z:hpo>, TA were not associated with these lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Tau accumulation in astrocytes in PSP was not preferential to (and was actually independent of) reactive astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the notion that tau accumulation in astrocytes is a degenerative rather than reactive process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Unlike NFT, astrocytic degeneration does not seem to contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> in PSP, and its clinical significance remains unclear </plain></SENT>
