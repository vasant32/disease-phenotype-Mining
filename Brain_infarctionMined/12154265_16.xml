<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Earlier, we found that lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with &gt; or =1 asymptomatic lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on CT had leukoaraiosis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> significantly more often than patients without such lesions, and we hypothesized that 2 types of small-vessel disease could be distinguished during life: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878486" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriolosclerosis</z:e> and microatheromatosis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Differences in prognosis might sustain this hypothesis of 2 lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we performed a follow-up in 333 patients with first lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, distinguishing those with &gt; or =1 asymptomatic lacunar lesions (LACI+) from those without such lesions (LACI-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cross-sectional follow-up was performed after 785+/-479 days (mean+/-SD) in 104 LACI+ patients and 865+/-545 days in 229 LACI- patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mortality at the end of follow-up was 33% in LACI+ and 21% in LACI- patients [odds ratio (OR), 1.74; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01 to 3.01] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> recurrence rate was 21% in LACI+ and 11% in LACI- (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.08 to 4.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty percent of LACI+ and 26% of LACI- patients had unfavorable outcome at the end of follow-up (OR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.17 to 3.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier curves showed less favorable survival in LACI+ (log-rank test, P=0.0218) and survival free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (log-rank test, P=0.0121) than in LACI- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When we restricted the analysis to patients with both silent lesions and leukoaraiosis (n=63) compared with those without (n=196), differences were even more pronounced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prognosis for mortality, recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and overall functional outcome in lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with &gt; or =1 silent lacunar lesions is more unfavorable than in patients without such lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings sustain the idea of 2 lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> entities </plain></SENT>
