<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-one patients were assessed at mean age of 21.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean age at first TX was 2.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain arterial border zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> had been documented in 54% of the children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HRQOL was assessed with the general 15-dimensional (15D) instrument generating an index on a 0 and 1 scale (1 for best) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with the corresponding childhood 17-dimensional instrument and an adult control group from the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Psychosocial adjustment was assessed with the ASEBA Adult Self Report (ASR) and compared with the childhood Child Behavior Checklist assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Half of the patients (52%) had a secondary level general or vocational education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The educational outcome was evenly distributed (compulsory vs. secondary) regardless of previous childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ASR Total Problems score was in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients had scores in the pathological range for Externalizing or Internalizing Problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a correlation between the childhood Child Behavior Checklist problem scores and the adult ASR scores for Internalizing and Total Problems but not for Externalizing Problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Their mean 15D HRQOL index was 0.94 and lower than for the control group (0.97, P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was a strong correlation between the childhood 17-dimensional and the adult 15D HRQOL index (r=0.63, P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The long-term outcome is fair in former high-risk pediatric TX patients with neurological comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Childhood psychosocial adjustment and HRQOL may predict the outcome in adults </plain></SENT>
