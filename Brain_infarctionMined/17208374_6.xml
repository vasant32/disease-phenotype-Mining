<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined how feeding conditions affect the CB1 receptor and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mice were divided into the following three groups: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diet (ND), caloric restriction (CR) and high-cholesterol-enriched diet (HCD), and were kept for 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 6 weeks, we measured both serum and brain cholesterol and the expression level of cannabinoid CB1 receptor within the brain in intact mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was occluded for 2 h following reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum cholesterol significantly increased in the HCD group in comparison with both the ND and CR groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, brain cholesterol decreased in the HCD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Then, the expression level of CB1 receptor significantly decreased in the HCD group, while that of the CR group clearly increased in comparison with the ND group in intact mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-occluded mice, The HCD group produced the most severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, while <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was significantly decreased in the CR group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that CR prevents infarction by increasing CB1 receptor expression, while high-cholesterol feeding aggravates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> both by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> in serum and by decreasing CB1 receptor expression modulated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003146'>hypocholesterolemia</z:hpo> within the brain </plain></SENT>
