<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One hundred consecutive cases of clinically diagnosed, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> forebrain infarction were studied using computerized tomography (CT) and electroencephalography (EEG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in 91 patients and was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the remaining nine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each EEG was read independently by two experienced electroencephalographers without knowledge of CT or clinical details and their findings were compared with those of CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lateralized theta and/or delta activity predicted ipsilateral cortical infarction with a sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 82% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, cerebral hemisphere lacunae produced similar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>EEG abnormalities</z:hpo> in only a few cases (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electroencephalography is particularly useful following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> if the initial CT excludes <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> but does not detect infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conjunction with clinical details, the EEG can then be used to indicate the likelihood of cortical involvement and thus suggest the likely pathophysiologic mechanism of infarction </plain></SENT>
