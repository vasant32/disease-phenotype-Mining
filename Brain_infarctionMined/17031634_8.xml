<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Infarctions affecting the basal ganglia are associated with a poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To correlate the distribution of infarction in children with TBM on CT with an outcome score (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: CT brain scans in children with TBM were retrospectively reviewed and the distribution of infarctions recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The degree of correlation with OS at 6 months was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a statistically significant association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sites of infarction (P = 0.0001-0.001), other than hemispheric (P = 0.35), and outcome score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was also a statistically significant association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of infarction (P = 0.0001-0.02), other than hemispheric (P = 0.05), and overall poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio for poor outcome with bilateral basal ganglia and internal capsule infarction was 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio for poor outcome with 'any infarction' was 4.91 (CI 2.24-10.74), with 'bilateral infarctions' 8.50 (CI 2.49-28.59), with basal ganglia infarction 5.73 (CI 2.60-12.64), and for hemispheric infarction 2.30 (CI 1.00-5.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Infarction is associated with a poor outcome unless purely hemispheric </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MRI diffusion-weighted imaging was not part of this study, but is likely to play a central role in detecting infarctions not demonstrated by CT </plain></SENT>
