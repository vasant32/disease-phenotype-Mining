<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mapping of brain perfusion using bolus tracking methods is increasingly used to assess the amount and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using relative perfusion maps, however, it is difficult to identify the tissue at risk-maximum (TARM) of infarction with sufficient reliability and reproducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analysed 76 perfusion computed tomography (PCT) derived maps of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV) and time-to-peak (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) in 40 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients using multidetector row technology and standard software (Somatom VolumeZoom, Siemens, Germany). 'Window narrowing' of the color maps was performed until color homogenisation of the contralateral unaffected hemisphere was reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tissue still depictable on the affected hemisphere after sufficient window narrowing was defined as the TARM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analysed presence and size of the TARM on PCT maps, its relative perfusion values by comparison with contralateral, mirrored tissue, and its correlation with occurrence and final size of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> on follow-up imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An ischemic area was visible in 64, 58.9 and 72.6% on the conventional CBF, CBV and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> maps, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After window narrowing, a TARM was present in 56.8, 54.1 and 63.0% of slices comprising 11.9, 11.6 and 21.1% of the ipsilateral hemisphere (CBF, CBV and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relative perfusion values were 38.7 (CBF) and 43.0% (CBV) for the entire ischemic area and 11.3 (CBF) and 13.3% (CBV) for the TARM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Definite <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was visible on 68.1% of the target slices comprising 23.7 +/- 22.9% of the ipsilateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The size of the TARM correlated slightly better with the final infarction size (r=0.74-0.82) than the entire ischemic area (r=0.61-0.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With respect to the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, the presence of a TARM on CBF maps showed the best positive (97.9%) and negative (72.7%) predictability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: On PCT maps, window narrowing provides a standardized display of the TARM in peracute <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The severely reduced values of relative CBF and CBV suggest the TARM to indicate tissue most prone to infarction </plain></SENT>
