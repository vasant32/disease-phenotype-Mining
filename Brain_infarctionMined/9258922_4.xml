<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed 13 patients with cortical laminar high signal on T1-weighted images to analyse the chronological changes in signal intensity and contrast enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High-density cortical lesions began to appear on T1-weighted images about 2 weeks after the ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 1-2 months they were prominent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They began to fade from 3 months but could be seen up to 11 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These cortical lesions showed isointensity or high intensity on T2-weighted images and did not show low intensity at any stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Contrast enhancement of the laminar lesions was prominent at 1-2 months and became less apparent from 3 months, but could be seen up to 8 months </plain></SENT>
