<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Ischemic ocular motor nerve palsies (IOMP) and lacunar brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> share a similar pathological mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical characteristics of patients as well as the protective role of aspirin should therefore be similar in both conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical records of 107 consecutive patients with IOMP and 160 patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>) were reviewed and analyzed with respect to patient characteristics, vascular risk factors, and aspirin intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data on patients with and without aspirin were compared within each group as well as between both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>Hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, smoking, high <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (&gt;70%) and the presence of more than one vascular risk factor in an individual patient were found to be more common in patients with lacunar brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> regardless of aspirin intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Absence of vascular risk factors was encountered more in IOMP patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The recurrence of lacunar <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> was significantly higher than recurrence of IOMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>Bell's palsy</z:hpo> was more common in IOMP patients than in patients with lacunar <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within the IOMP group, the prevalence of vascular risk factors did not differ between the aspirin and non-aspirin group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">Ischemic heart disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e>), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> and recurrence were found more often in the aspirin group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Within the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> group <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> and recurrence rate were more common in the aspirin group whereas smoking was found to be more common in the non-aspirin group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>Arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> is the main cause of lacunar <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> and IOMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, IOMP depends less on the presence of vascular risk factors than does lacunar <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, aspirin - at least at low doses - does not seem to have a protective effect on either of these conditions, but more extensive prospective studies of homogeneous groups of patients are needed to clarify the preventive role of antiplatelet agents in IOMP </plain></SENT>
