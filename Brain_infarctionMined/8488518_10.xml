<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The relative frequency of computed tomographic evidence of old <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> without prior history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and their effect on short- and long-term outcome of patients with first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, are currently unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Silent infarctions may relate to specific risk factors and may influence the rate of survival free of handicap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the prevalence of such lesions in patients registered with SEPIVAC, a community-based survey of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence and outcome in the Sixth Local Health Unit of Umbria, Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 375 first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, 209 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (computed tomogram done within 30 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Computed tomograms were reviewed blindly, and cases were classified as having a single lesion or multiple lesions; in the latter case, it was assumed that at least one silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two groups were compared in terms of risk factors and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To avoid a selection bias, these patients were also compared with 68 patients who were not submitted to computed tomography but were judged on clinical grounds to have a &gt; 90% probability of having suffered a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Risk factors and outcome did not differ between patients without and with a computed tomogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the latter group, 80 patients (38.3%; 95% confidence interval, 31.7%-44.9%) had silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Male sex (odds ratio, 1.84; 95% confidence interval, 1-3.4), ischemic changes on an electrocardiogram (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-4.9), and--in the multivariate analysis--<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (odds ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-2) were significantly more frequent in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Outcome at 1, 6, and 12 months was not influenced by the presence of silent infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This community-based study shows that silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> in patients with first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are not significantly related to risk factors commonly described in hospital-based series (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, etc.); rather, silent infarctions seem to be a marker of widespread <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
