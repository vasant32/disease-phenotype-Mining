<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free patients is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">impaired cognition</z:e> and structural abnormalities of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AF contributes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the absence of manifest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, AF can activate coagulation and cause cerebral microembolism which could damage the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We cross-sectionally evaluated 122 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free individuals with AF recruited locally within the German Competence Network on AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As comparator, we recruited 563 individuals aged 37-84 years without AF from the same community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects underwent 3 T magnetic resonance imaging to assess covert territorial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, white matter lesions, and brain volume measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects with evidence for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cognitive function was assessed by an extensive neuropsychological test battery covering the domains learning and memory, attention and executive functions, working memory, and visuospatial skills </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cognitive scores and radiographic measures were compared across individuals with and without AF by stepwise multiple regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-free individuals with AF performed significantly worse in tasks of learning and memory (ß = -0.115, P &lt; 0.01) as well as attention and executive functions (ß = -0.105, P &lt; 0.01) compared with subjects without AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was also a trend (P = 0.062) towards worse performance in learning and memory tasks in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> as compared with paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Corresponding to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo>, hippocampal volume was reduced in patients with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Other radiographic measures did not differ between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Even in the absence of manifest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, AF is a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, cognition and measures of structural brain integrity should be considered in the evaluation of novel treatments for AF </plain></SENT>
