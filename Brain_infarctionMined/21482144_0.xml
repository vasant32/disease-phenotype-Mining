<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Postmortem data have shown that blood pressure before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> correlates more closely with a narrowing of the vertebral arteries than any other vessel studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study explores a possible association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, both before and after posterior circulation infarction (POCI) compared to anterior circulation infarction (ACI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with a first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> enrolled in the South London <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Register between 2000 and 2006 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression were used to compare risk factors including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, sex, smoking history, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> in patients with POCI compared to ACI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chi-square testing was used to compare the incidence of newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> after POCI and ACI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Absolute blood pressure readings recorded before <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were also compared between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On multivariable analysis, POCI was significantly associated with male sex (odds ratio [OR] 2.24; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.55-3.22; P &lt; .001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR 1.69; 95% CI 1.15-2.50; P = .008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, patients with POCI were more likely to be newly diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> during a 1-year follow-up period (OR 2.15; 95% CI 1.20-3.86; P = .009) and as an inpatient (OR 3.27; 95% CI 1.49-7.13; P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in the POCI group before <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (152 v 146 mm Hg; P = .027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diastolic blood pressure was significantly higher 7 days poststroke (81 v 74 mm Hg; P = .01) in patients not previously diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown a significant association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> before and after POCI compared to ACI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We believe further investigation with brainstem imaging and recordings of sympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system activity after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is warranted </plain></SENT>
