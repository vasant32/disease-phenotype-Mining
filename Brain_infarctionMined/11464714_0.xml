<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A group of 56 patients was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> was diagnosed as caused by atherosclerotic changes in main cerebral arteries in 32 patients and in 11 by changes in cervical arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 13 persons a lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was recognised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean Lp(a) level and the median value were significantly higher in the group of patients after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as compared with 45 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A more frequent occurrence of Lp(a) level over 30 mg/dl considered as pathological was observed more often in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No correlation was seen between Lp(a) and the resistance of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> to oxidation nor between Lp(a) and the amount of products of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> oxidation in vitro </plain></SENT>
