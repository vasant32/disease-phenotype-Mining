<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion was performed in male rats and the short- (neurological severity score [NSS], <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size), intermediate- (cognition) and long-term (necrotic area) effects were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A bolus (3 mg/kg) of rasagiline followed by a 3-h infusion (3 mg/kg/h), initiated immediately after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size by 48.6% and NSS by 32.7% relative to saline treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cognitive function, tested in a water maze 2-3 weeks after occlusion, also significantly improved compared with saline-treated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Necrotic brain area was 35-50% smaller with rasagiline than with saline following a single bolus dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The single bolus rasagiline dose was as effective as a rasagiline bolus followed by rasagiline infusion in short-term outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effect of rasagiline was fully reproducible when administered at 2 h following occlusion but not after 4 h </plain></SENT>
