<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the effects of P2X7 receptor blockade in preventing microglia activation and ameliorating brain damage and neurological impairment, we delivered the P2 unselective <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> Reactive Blue 2 to rats after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In sham-operated animals, devoid of brain damage, double immunofluorescence verified the absence of P2X7 immunoreactivity on resting microglia, astrocytes, and neurons, identified, respectively, by OX-42, glial fibrillary acid protein, and neuronal nuclei (NeuN) immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, vehicle-treated rats showed monolateral sensorimotor deficit and tissue damage in striatum and frontoparietal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, P2X7 immunoreactivity was de novo expressed on activated microglia in infarcted and surrounding areas, as well as on a reactive form of microglia, resting in shape but P2X7 immunoreactive, present in ipsi- and contralateral cingulate and medial frontal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reactive Blue 2 improved sensorimotor deficit and restricted the volume of infarction, without preventing the expression of P2X7, but inducing it in the microglia of contralateral frontal and parietal cortex and striatum, which had lost reciprocal connections with the remote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>De novo expression of P2X7 occurred in both activated and reactive microglia, suggesting their differentiated roles in the area of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and in remote regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reactive Blue 2 reduced ischemic brain damage, likely blocking the function of activated microglia in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, but in the remote brain regions promoted the expression of P2X7 on reactive microglia, developing defense and reparative processes </plain></SENT>
