<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The occlusion of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was made in 170 Sprague-Dawley rats, and reperfusion was performed 2 h after the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another 10 Sprague-Dawley rats were used for sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>3-AB was administered to 85 rats 10 min before the occlusion [3-AB group (n = 85) vs. control group without 3-AB (n = 85)] </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the 3-AB group, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and the water content were decreased (about 45% and 3.6%, respectively, at 24 h), the number of TUNEL-positive cells was decreased (about 36% at 24 h), and the IRs of PAR, cleaved caspase-3, CD11b, ICAM-1 and COX-2 were significantly reduced, while the IRs of pAkt and pGSK-3 were increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that 3-AB treatment could reduce the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by reducing ischaemic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, its related <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and increasing survival signals </plain></SENT>
