<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Moderate unilateral <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of shoulder and hip muscles and limb-kinetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002186'>apraxia</z:hpo> were observed in 11 patients with frontal lobe lesions on the side opposite to the neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the CT scans, the posterior border of the lesions lay anterior to the precentral gyrus, thus involving the premotor cortex but not the primary motor cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 9 cases, the lesions were caused by a brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, in 2 cases by a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 1 patient the lesion was purely subcortical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whereas the <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> affected <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hip muscles, in the shoulder mainly those movements associated with abduction and elevation of the arm were disturbed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The EMG showed considerable delays for the preactivation of proximal arm muscles during rapid arm movements, thus interfering with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> proximal-distal sequencing of muscle action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Limb-kinetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002186'>apraxia</z:hpo> only became apparent during tasks requiring certain coordinations between both arms or legs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bimanual interaction was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients with proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and small lesions in the precentral gyrus which have been examined for comparison showed no limb-kinetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002186'>apraxia</z:hpo> and different distributions of the paretic shoulder girdle muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In view of the long-standing controversies as to the functional role of the premotor cortex and the question of specific deficits after lesions of this area, the relevant literature is reviewed </plain></SENT>
