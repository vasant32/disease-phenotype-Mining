<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following reperfusion, 1 mM PS794 solution was administered intravenously via a tail vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence images were captured between 6 to 72 hours postinjection using a LI-COR Biosciences Pearl Imaging System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Strong fluorescence signals, which may represent the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core, were detected in the right hemisphere, ipsilateral to the injured site, and weaker signals in areas surrounding the core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion rats injected with a control dye not linked to a targeting agent, fluorescence was distributed diffusely throughout the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To address the issue of whether Zn-<z:chebi fb="14" ids="39867,4640,53488">DPA</z:chebi> targets apoptotic/necrotic cells, HT22 mouse hippocampal neurons were cultured in either Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium, serum-deprived medium, Hank's Balanced Salt Solution, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29988">L-glutamate</z:chebi> (10 mM)-containing medium for up to 33 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cells were then double-labeled with PSVue 480 (Zn-<z:chebi fb="14" ids="39867,4640,53488">DPA</z:chebi> conjugated to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein isothiocyanate</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi>, which labels necrotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microscopic examination revealed that PS480 targeted apoptotic and necrotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The result indicates that PS794 is applicable to in vivo imaging of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and that Zn-<z:chebi fb="14" ids="39867,4640,53488">DPA</z:chebi> selectively targets apoptotic/necrotic cells </plain></SENT>
