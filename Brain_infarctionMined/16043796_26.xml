<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To use neuropathologic data to examine the association between APOE genotype and cerebrovascular lesions commonly found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD), as well as neuritic senile plaque (SP) and neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The sample comprised brains from 96 men and 3 women who fulfilled NIA-Reagan criteria for intermediate to high likelihood of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Region-specific and global measures of gross cerebrovascular disease, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878486" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriolosclerosis</z:e>, white matter lesions, microinfarcts, amyloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e>, neuritic SP, and NFT burden were compared among those who had at least one APOE-epsilon4 vs those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pairwise rank-order correlations between measures were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association between APOE epsilon4 status and measures of vascular and AD pathology, adjusting for age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, sex, brain weight, and Braak stage, were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: APOE-epsilon4 was not associated with gross cerebrovascular pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to those who were negative, brains from epsilon4 individuals had a greater degree of small vessel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878486" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriolosclerosis</z:e> (p = 0.04) and perivascular macrophage infiltration (p = 0.06), but not other markers of small vessel disease or white matter myelin loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microinfarcts in the deep nuclei were associated with epsilon4 (p = 0.009), whereas cortical and subcortical microinfarcts were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward association between APOE genotype and amyloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> (p = 0.08), and epsilon4 was associated with neuritic SP burden, but not NFT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: APOE-epsilon4 is associated with small vessel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878486" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriolosclerosis</z:e>, microinfarcts of the deep nuclei, neuritic senile plaque density, and amyloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> in patients with autopsy-proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a role for epsilon4 in some of the microvascular changes commonly found in AD and are consistent with a potential amyloidogenic role for epsilon4 </plain></SENT>
