<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we performed neurophysiological recordings from single neurons of rats with permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (pMCAO) during the resolution of their neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results show that complex and dynamic changes of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transmission in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area parallel the recovery from brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have observed that frequency and duration of spontaneous <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-mediated synaptic events were markedly increased in striatal neurons during the early phase of the recovery (3 days after pMCAO), due to potentiation of both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> (N-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-d-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi>) and non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor-mediated transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the late phase of recovery (7 days after pMCAO), <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transmission was still enhanced because of a selective facilitation of non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor-mediated transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spiny projection neurons but not aspiny interneurons underwent detectable changes of synaptic excitability in the striatum following pMCAO, indicating that the process of neuronal adaptation after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> is cell-type-specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results provide a synaptic correlate of the long-lasting brain hyperexcitability mediating recovery described with noninvasive neurophysiological approaches </plain></SENT>
