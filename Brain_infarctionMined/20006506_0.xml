<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of their close proximity to the basilar artery, the vulnerability occurs especially during surgical interventions for vascular pathologies such as basilar apex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, extensive knowledge of the microsurgical <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of this area is mandatory to prevent poor post-operative outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We microscopically examined 28 P1 segments obtained from 14 adult fresh cadaver brains (6 silicone injected, 8 freshly examined) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The P1 segments ranged between 2.8mm and 12.2mm (mean 6.8mm) in length with a mean outer diameter of 1.85 mm (range 0.8-4.5mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 94 thalamoperforating branches identified in 27 P1 segments (mean 3.35 branches per segment) arose from the postero-superior aspect of P1 and were the most proximally originating branch in nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> specimens (96.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition in 28 P1s, 12 short circumflex arteries (42.8%; mean 0.42 branches per segment), 16 long circumflex arteries (57.1%; mean 0.57 branches per segment) and 10 medial posterior choroidal arteries (35.7%; mean 0.35 branches per segment) were identified and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> originated from the posterior or postero-inferior surface of the P1 segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the P1 segment had more than one type of branch, it was the short circumflex arteries that were always more proximal in origin than the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The medial posterior choroidal arteries were always more distal in origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three branches were not observed together in any of the P1 segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings in this, and future, anatomical studies may help to reduce the post-surgical morbidity and mortality rates after surgery for posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
