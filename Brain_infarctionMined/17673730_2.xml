<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, mobile aortic plaques (MAPs) have been proposed as embolic sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical characteristics of patients with MAPs are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively studied patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> who underwent transesophageal echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were classified into 3 groups based on transesophageal echocardiography findings: atheromatous aortic plaques &lt;4 mm, atheromatous aortic plaques &gt; or =4 mm without mobility, and MAPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on their diffusion-weighted image findings, the patients were divided into 3 subgroups: (1) single lesion; (2) multiple lesions in a single vascular territory; and (3) multiple lesions in multiple vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We assessed the clinical characteristics and the diffusion-weighted image findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with MAPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred sixty-seven patients (age, 70+/-12 years; 98 males) were enrolled; 128 (77%) had atheromatous aortic plaques &lt;4 mm, 27 (16%) had atheromatous aortic plaques &gt; or =4 mm, and 12 (7%) had MAPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Older age, male gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, and cerebral arterial stenotic lesions were seen most frequently in patients with MAPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On diffusion-weighted image findings, patients with MAPs were most frequent in the multiple lesions in multiple vascular territories group (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On multiple logistic regression analysis, the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score (OR: 1.11; 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.22; P=0.039), arterial stenotic lesions (OR: 4.71; 95% CI: 1.35 to 16.41; P=0.015), and mobile aortic plaques (OR: 14.44; 95% CI: 2.87 to 72.66; P=0.001) were significantly associated with the multiple lesions in multiple vascular territories group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MAPs were not uncommonly observed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MAPs could cause multiple brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on diffusion-weighted images </plain></SENT>
