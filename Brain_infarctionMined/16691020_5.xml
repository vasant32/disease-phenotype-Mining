<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we sought to investigate the factors associated with poor outcome in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We have performed a secondary study in 113 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> admitted within the first 24 h of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (mean age 70 years, 57.5% men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure, body temperature, serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, <z:chebi fb="65" ids="25512">neurotransmitters</z:chebi> and pro-inflammatory markers were measured at admission and during the first 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> severity was assessed by the Canadian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (CSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging evaluation was performed at admission and between days 4 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Poor functional outcome was considered as a Barthel index &lt;85 at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 36 patients (31.9%) had poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Older age (p = 0.009), history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (p = 0.005), higher body temperature (p &lt; 0.0001), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (p = 0.010), serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (p = 0.002) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (p &lt; 0.0001) levels, as well as lower CSS score at admission (p &lt; 0.0001) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> predictive factors of poor outcome in bivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SBP at admission (OR 2.07, CI 95% 1.04-3.28, p = 0.015) was the only clinical predictor on multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When the logistic model was further adjusted for biomarkers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and excitotoxicity, IL-6 levels (OR 1.09, CI 95% 1.01-1.26, p = 0.003), but not SBP, was independently associated with poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This association persisted even after adjusting for potential predictors recorded during the first 72 h of hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High SBP and IL-6 levels on admission may predict poor outcome in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
