<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the value of lower-limb short latency somatosensory evoked potentials (SLSEP) in predicting early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients with massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-eight patients of massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> were admitted in the Neurological Intensive Care Unit (NICU) between March 2008 and March 2009, and Glasgow-Pittsburgh <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> scale (GPCS) and SLSEP were recorded and graded within 24 h after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into survival and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> groups (including brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) according to their short-term prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The correlations of SLSEP and GPCS to the mortality were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant correlation was found between SLSEP and the mortality in patients with massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (r=0.484, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value of the SLSEP grade 3 to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 100%, and the patients with malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> (mMCAI) appeared to have a 100% mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SLSEP grade 3 can be a highly specificity in predicting early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients with massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, and it is also of value in determining the timing of surgical intervention of mMCAI </plain></SENT>
