<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The in vivo studies we carried out in the 42 insulin treated diabetic patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005978'>diabetes mellitus type II</z:hpo>), as well as conducted the in vitro investigations of the blood both of the diabetic patients (24) and of the healthy people (20) where the insulin was added to the blood ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The RBC aggregability in blood investigated with the "Georgian technique" was found significantly enhanced, by about 100 per cents in the diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Under the in vivo conditions insulin administered intravenously decreased the RBC aggregability almost to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, in the in vitro studies we found that the insulin lowered significantly the RBC aggregability when it was significantly enhanced by addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran</z:chebi>-500, as well as in the blood of patients with the ischemic brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The decreasing effect on the RBC aggregability was observed even in the healthy control group where the RBC aggregability was in a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
