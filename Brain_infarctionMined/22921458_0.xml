<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is currently the only approved drug for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> treatment, with a dose of 0.9 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the fibrinolytic activity of rt-PA has been reported in vitro to be 10-fold less potent in rodent than in human, in most in vivo experimental models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> rt-PA is used at 10 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of the "human" (0.9 mg/kg) and "rodent" (10 mg/kg) doses of rt-PA given at an early or a delayed time point in a mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by thrombin injection into the left middle cerebral artery of mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rt-PA (0.9 or 10 mg/kg) was intravenously administered 30 min or 4 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of reperfusion after rt-PA was followed for 90 min after its injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neurological deficit, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and hemorrhagic transformations (HT) were assessed at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion was complete after early administration of rt-PA at 10 mg/kg but partial with rt-PA at 0.9 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both doses given at 4 h induced partial reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Early administration of both doses of rt-PA reduced the neurological deficit, lesion volume and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, without modifying post-ischemic HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Injected at 4 h, rt-PA at 0.9 and 10 mg/kg lost its beneficial effects and worsened HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in the mouse thrombin <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model, the "human" dose of rt-PA exhibits effects close to those observed in clinic </plain></SENT>
