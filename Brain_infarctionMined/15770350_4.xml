<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An impaired cortical vein might cause cerebral venous circulatory disturbances (CVCDs) resulting in venous infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this article, we have reviewed the management and results of eight cases with symptomatic postoperative venous infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have encountered eight cases with symptomatic postoperative venous infarction (0.3%) during the past 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The series is composed of 3 males and 5 females, with ages that ranged from 43 to 76 years (mean age of 58.1 years), and consisted of five <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp>, one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018920" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cavernoma</z:e>, one dural AVF, and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0100661'>trigeminal neuralgia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Initial symptoms occurred intra-operatively in two, on 0 day after the operation in one, 1 day in three, 3 days in one, and 4 days in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The symptoms were intra-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> in two cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo> in one, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001317'>cerebellar signs</z:hpo> in one, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> in one, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> in two, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two cases required surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results were a good outcome in 6 and a fair outcome in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, there are two types of postoperative venous infarction; severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (severe type) and gradual <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (mild type) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The former needs immediate treatment from the intra-operative period onward, and the prevention of the ongoing <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> is essential in the latter </plain></SENT>
