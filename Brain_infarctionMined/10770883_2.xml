<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Very often these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are unclippable because they are fusiform or have a large neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) is the treatment of choice in many cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This procedure has however a high risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Revascularization of the brain by extra-intracranial anastomosis between the superficial temporal artery (STA) and branches of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> is frequently performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This procedure provides however a low flow bypass and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> may occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We report two cases of giant cavernous sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated by high flow bypass and endovascular balloon occlusion of the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immediate high flow revascularization of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branches was achieved and the patients showed no ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up of 8 and 14 months after operation shows patency of the venous graft and no neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Angiographic control examination showed complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> occlusion in both cases </plain></SENT>
