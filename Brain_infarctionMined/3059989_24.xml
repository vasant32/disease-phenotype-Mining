<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> groups received preischemic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> loading (2 gm/kg) to promote <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following completion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, rats received either 2 to 3 IU/kg (low-dose group) or 8 to 20 IU/kg (high-dose group) insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the survival period, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were maintained in the ranges of 1.2 to 2.9 mM and 2.9 to 4.9 mM, respectively, for the low-dose and high-dose insulin groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control rats were given 2 gm/kg <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> immediately following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the recovery period, until perfusion at 7 days, they were given <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, 2 gm/kg, twice daily by intraperitoneal injection, and their drinking water was supplemented with 25% <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality (p less than 0.05) and postischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> incidence (p less than 0.01) were significantly reduced in the low-dose insulin group compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mortality was increased in the high-dose insulin group compared to the control group and was associated with an increased incidence of postischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neuropathological examination revealed no cortical infarction in the low-dose or high-dose insulin-treated rats compared to a 60% incidence of cortical infarction in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, the high-dose insulin-treated group showed a significant reduction in striatal and hippocampal CA1 selective neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> compared to control rats with comparable survivals (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that postischemic blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations play an important role in modulating both ischemic infarction and selective neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
