<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present a 3-year-old patient with stenotic kinking of the left internal carotid artery (ICA) who developed an ischaemic infarction of the left brain hemisphere followed by severe neurological sequelae after a prolonged generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At time of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> the boy was in biological remission of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> and received <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The haemodynamic consequences of inborn kinking of the ICA is discussed controversely in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presented case shows that stenotic kinking of the ICA may significantly impair the blood flow towards the homolateral hemisphere and therefore may result in an ischaemic infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The influence of CsA on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> activity is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case provides clinical and radiological evidence supporting an association between stenotic kinking of the carotid artery and homolateral hemispheric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
