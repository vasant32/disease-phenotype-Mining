<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the role of feeding tube placement in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> in patients with attenuated protective reflexes is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the relationship between the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> and the state of cough and swallowing reflexes in post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with oral or tube feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> was prospectively analysed for 1 year in three groups of post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients on the basis of the following clinical conditions: oral feeding without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> (n = 43); oral feeding with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> (n = 48); and nasogastric tube feeding with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> (n = 52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also studied the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> in bedridden patients with nasogastric tube feeding (n = 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Before the start of the study, the swallowing and cough reflexes of each patient were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The swallowing reflex was evaluated according to latency of response, which was timed from the injection of 1 mL of distilled water into the pharynx through a nasal catheter to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of swallowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cough threshold of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="30769">citric acid</z:chebi> aerosols was defined as the concentration at which the patient coughed five times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS.;: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> was observed in patients having both a latency of response longer than 5 s and a cough threshold for <z:chebi fb="14" ids="30769">citric acid</z:chebi> higher than a concentration of 1.35 (log mg mL-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> was significantly higher in patients with oral feeding than in those with tube feeding (54.3 vs. 13.2%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In bedridden patients with tube feeding, the latency of response was longer than 20 s and no patient coughed at the highest concentration of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="30769">citric acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> was 64.3% in such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The state of protective reflexes had a significant relation to the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Feeding tube placement may have a beneficial role in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011951'>aspiration pneumonia</z:hpo> in mildly or moderately disabled post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with attenuated protective reflexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Bedridden patients who were tube-fed had the highest incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
