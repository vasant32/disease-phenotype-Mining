<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The threshold for activation of the motor cortex on the affected side was higher and the cortical representational maps of individual muscles were less well defined than those on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that electrophysiological changes in cortical organisation can be demonstrated following withdrawal of, or imbalance in sensory afferent activity to the cerebral cortex in humans </plain></SENT>
