<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Research into neonatal ischemic brain damage is impeded by the lack of a complete understanding of the initial hemodynamic mechanisms resulting in a lesion, particularly that of NO-mediated vascular mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rat model, we recently show that collateral recruitment contributes to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Non-specific and selective NO synthase (NOS) inhibition was evaluated on cerebral blood-flow changes and outcome in a P7 rat model of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> (left middle cerebral artery electrocoagulation with 50 min occlusion of both common carotid arteries) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood-flow changes were measured by using ultrasound imaging with sequential Doppler recordings in both internal carotid arteries and basilar trunk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cortical perfusion was measured by using laser Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We showed that global NOS inhibition significantly reduced collateral support and cortical perfusion (collateral failure), and worsened the ischemic injury in both gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, endothelial NOS inhibition increased blood-flows and aggravated volume lesion in males, whereas in females blood-flows did not change and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> lesion was significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These changes were associated with decreased phosphorylation of neuronal NOS at Ser(847) in males and increased phosphorylation in females at 24h, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neuronal NOS inhibition also increased blood-flows in males but not in females, and did not significantly change <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes compared to their respective PBS-treated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, both nNOS and eNOS appear to play a key role in modulating arterial blood flow during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> mainly in male pups with subsequent modifications in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> lesion </plain></SENT>
