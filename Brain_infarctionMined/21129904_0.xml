<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the safety and benefit of urgent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stable neurologic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study involved patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurologic impairment, defined as ≥ 4 points on the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) evaluation related to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> ≥ 50% who underwent urgent CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preoperative workup included neurologic assessment with the NIHSS on admission or immediately before surgery and at discharge, carotid duplex scanning, transcranial Doppler ultrasound imaging, and head computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>End points were perioperative (30-day) neurologic mortality, significant NIHSS score improvement or worsening (defined as a variation ≥ 4), and hemorrhagic or ischemic neurologic recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated according to their NIHSS score on admission (4-7 or ≥ 8), clinical and demographic characteristics, timing of surgery (before or after 6 hours), and presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> on neuroimaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between January 2005 and December 2009, 62 CEAs were performed at a mean of 34.2 ± 50.2 hours (range, 2-280 hours) after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No neurologic mortality nor significant NIHSS score worsening was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The NIHSS score decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but four patients, with no new ischemic lesions detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean NIHSS score was 7.05 ± 3.41 on admission and 3.11 ± 3.62 at discharge in the entire group (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with an NIHSS score of ≥ 8 on admission had a bigger score reduction than those with a lower NIHSS score (NIHSS 4-7; mean 4.95 ± 1.03 preoperatively vs 1.31 ± 1.7 postoperatively, NIHSS ≥ 8 10.32 ± 1.94 vs 4.03 ± 3.67; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurologic event, a high NIHSS score does not contraindicate early surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To date, guidelines recommend treatment of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> ≤ 2 weeks from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms to minimize the neurologic recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that minimizing the time for intervention not only reduces the risk of recurrence but can also improve neurologic outcome </plain></SENT>
