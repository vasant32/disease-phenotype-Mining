<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIM: To clarify whether Broca's subregions, comprising the pars triangularis and pars opercularis, play different roles in syntactic processing, we investigated Japanese <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patients with selective damage in each subregion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four patients participated in this study: 3 showing lesions mostly restricted to the pars opercularis (Op group) and a rare case with a lesion mostly restricted to the pars triangularis (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the Object Manipulation Task, scores and error types were compared between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e> and the Op patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No marked differences in total score were evident between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e> and Op patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e> patient showed greater difficulty with dative sentences than the Op patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e> patient showed rather high scores with relative sentences, whereas the Op patients were rarely able to manipulate items correctly for relative sentences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e> patient tended to posit items in canonical word order incorrectly, whereas the Op group tended to make simplification errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Broca's subregions play different roles in syntactic processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Considering Japanese sentence structure, the results indicate that the pars triangularis is involved in comprehension of semantic relationships among syntactically equivalent nominal phrases assigned thematic roles, while the pars opercularis is involved in thematic role transformation and/or reinterpretation </plain></SENT>
