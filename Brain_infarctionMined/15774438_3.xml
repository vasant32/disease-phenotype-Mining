<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of MABI and their impact on aetiological classification and prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> examined with DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 182 consecutive patients defined by DWI were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> aetiology was classified according to the TOAST criteria, though "lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>" included patients with possible aetiologies other than SAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Type 1 MABI were detected in 21/72 patients (29%) with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and type 2 MABI in 8/110 (7%) with non-lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism different from SAD was found in nine type 1 MABI cases (43%): <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e> (4); other determined aetiology (3); aortic embolism (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardiac (2) or aortic (1) sources of embolism were detected in eight type 2 MABI cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MABI patients with cardiac or aortic sources of embolism were treated with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, the remainder with aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Detection of type 1 MABI in patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> improved diagnostic confidence and the choice of antithrombotic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further study is needed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention in MABI cases caused by SAD alone </plain></SENT>
