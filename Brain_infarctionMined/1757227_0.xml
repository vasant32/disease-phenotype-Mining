<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This work describes that prolonged mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> may lead to either general or regional derangement of brain morphofunctional integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Normotensive adult Wistar rats were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under anesthesia with volatile agents or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi>, the common carotid arteries were ligated permanently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one group of animals local cerebral blood flow (1CBF) was measured two hours after carotid occlusion using the [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other carotid-occluded animals were used for clinical rating and histological evaluation, which was performed two days to 4 weeks after surgical operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine method showed widespread reduction in the cerebral circulation of carotid-occluded animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several hours after carotid occlusion, 40% of the animals showed dramatic neurological signs and died on the day of operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 35% of surviving animals, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> were observed in one and exceptionally two areas of the sensorimotor cortex, thalamus, hippocampus or cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The evolutionary sequence of the histopathological changes seems to date the induction of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> to the early period of carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, reduction of cerebral blood flow causes, in a high percentage of animals, various degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain damage after an apparent symptom-free interval </plain></SENT>
