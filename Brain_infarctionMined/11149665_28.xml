<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the effects of <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> formation and endothelial cell damage that follows subsequent permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transient (15 minute) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was used for <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three days after <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> or a sham operation, permanent MCAO was induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after permanent MCAO, neurologic deficit, infarction volume, and water and ion content were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six hours post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) permeability was examined using [3H]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15443">inulin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Water, ion contents, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability were assessed in three zones (core, intermediate, and outer) depending on their relation to the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) was also examined as a potential marker of vascular injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The model of <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> significantly reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and neurologic deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with a sham operation, <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> also significantly attenuated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> formation in the intermediate (sham and <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> water contents: 5.99+/-0.65 vs. 4.99+/-0.81 g/g dry weight; P &lt; 0.01) and outer zones (5.02+/-0.48 vs. 4.37+/-0.42 g/g dry weight; P &lt; 0.01) of the ipsilateral hemisphere but not in the core zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Blood-brain barrier disruption assessed by [3H]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15443">inulin</z:chebi> was significantly attenuated in the <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> group and the number of blood vessels that displayed HSP70 immunoreactivity was also reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> significantly attenuates ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> formation, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption, and, as assessed by HSP70, vascular injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Understanding the mechanisms involved in <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> may provide insight into methods for preserving cerebrovascular function during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
