<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A novel psychoacoustic discrimination test (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) was developed to determine ear asymmetries in the discrimination of changes in intensity, frequency, or temporal structure of regularly presented dichotic stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 19 of 21 patients with lesions of the auditory cortex or the acoustic radiation according to CT scan evaluation a higher error score was observed for target stimuli presented at the ear contralateral to the side of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (6 right, 15 left) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 2 and in 3 other patients with lesions sparing auditory structures no significant ear asymmetries were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This may indicate that auditory perception is reduced in patients with only one intact auditory cortex or one intact acoustic radiation, possibly because of a limitation in information processing capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Auditory evoked potential results are presented for a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subject and two patients to illustrate electrophysiologic correlates of central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0949114,C0260662" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hearing disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using a transformation of scalp into dipole source activity (Scherg and von Cramon 1986), a unilateral loss of middle latency activity was found in case A, who had a lesion of the left acoustic radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The extended lesion of the right auditory cortex in case B resulted in a loss of both middle and late latency dipole source potentials of the right temporal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both cases a corresponding increase in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> error score on the contralateral ear was found </plain></SENT>
