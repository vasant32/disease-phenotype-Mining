<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To describe magnetic resonance imaging characteristics in a large sample of subjects with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) and to investigate associations between these characteristics and cognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Baseline data of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of galantamine in MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Included in the study were 896 subjects with MCI (age [mean +/- SD], 70 +/- 9 years; 54% women) with available clinical and magnetic resonance imaging data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neuropsychology: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer Disease</z:hpo> Assessment Scale, cognitive subscale, MCI version, assessing global cognition; delayed recall on the New York University Paragraph Recall Test, assessing episodic memory; and Digit Symbol Substitution Test, assessing executive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging: Medial Temporal Lobe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>Atrophy</z:mpath> (MTA) Rating Scale (0-4) and Age-Related White Matter Changes Scale (0-30), assessing white matter hyperintensities (WMHs); and lacune counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median MTA score was 2 (range, 0-4), and mean (+/- SD) Age-Related White Matter Changes Scale score 6.0 (+/- 4.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lacunes were present in 33% of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In unadjusted models, increasing MTA and WMHs were associated with poorer performance on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cognitive tests, and lacunes with poorer performance on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer Disease</z:hpo> Assessment Scale, cognitive subscale, MCI version, and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariable models, including magnetic resonance imaging measures simultaneously, MTA remained a predictor of cognition, whereas WMH had no independent predictive value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was an interaction between MTA and lacunes: the strength of the association with the Digit Symbol Substitution Test increased with decreasing MTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Medial temporal lobe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> seems to be a more important predictor of cognition than small-vessel disease in MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Lacunes were associated with performance on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, especially in subjects with milder MTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although WMHs were prevalent and associated with cognition in unadjusted analyses, there was no discernible association between WMHs and the cognitive measures in this study after adjustment for age </plain></SENT>
