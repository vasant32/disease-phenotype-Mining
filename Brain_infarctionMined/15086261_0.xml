<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While immediate valve replacement eliminates the focus and therefore the high risk of re-embolization, a neurosurgical intervention is considered a contraindication to early cardiosurgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein, the first report is presented of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006689'>bacterial endocarditis</z:hpo> and a space-occupying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> with imminent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e>, who successfully underwent mitral valve replacement only 24 h after decompressive craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To prevent rebleeding, maximal hemostasis was ensured during the neurosurgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For cardiosurgery, the patient was cooled to 21 degrees C, mildly hyperventilated, and maintained at an adequate perfusion pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A bioprosthesis was used to reduce the time of anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient did not develop new <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> after either intervention, and there was only a very small hemorrhagic transformation without a relevant mass effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At five months after surgery the patient had minimal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurological abnormalities</z:hpo> and was able to conduct his daily life without help </plain></SENT>
