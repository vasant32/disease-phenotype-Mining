<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We undertook to study the clinical relevance of silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) and their individual and combined effects on outcome variables of neurological and epidemiological interest in first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed univariate and multivariate analyses of data prospectively collected in the Klosterneuburg <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Data Bank, a hospital-based registry in Austria that includes a 3-year follow-up program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 728 patients (mean age, 68 +/- 10 years) with a first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, 110 (15%) had had a previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, and 66/618 (11%) patients did not have a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> but showed evidence of silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> on CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome variables of neurological interest were not significantly different between groups, including time between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and study entry, activities of daily living status at first presentation, median time of hospitalization, 30-day mortality, or 3-year mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate analyses of epidemiologically important risk factors showed either history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or evidence of silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> to be more frequently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (P = .007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox models of survival showed that neither history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> nor evidence of silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> were significantly associated with an increase in 3-year mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Over a period of 3 years, neither history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> nor evidence of silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> diagnosed at the time of the presenting major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients exert an important influence on neurological or epidemiological outcome variables </plain></SENT>
