<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endovascular treatment for symptomatic IA stenosis was planned to prevent recurrent attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endovascular stenting for IA stenosis via the right femoral artery approach was performed under simultaneous distal balloon protection of the right internal carotid artery (ICA) and vertebral artery (VA) via the right brachial artery approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Successful treatment of symptomatic IA stenosis was achieved with no complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The technique with simultaneous distal balloon protection of the ICA and VA provided excellent cerebral protection in stenting of IA stenosis </plain></SENT>
