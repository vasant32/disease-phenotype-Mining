<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate safety of early carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> presenting to the emergency department <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> units (EDSU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The neurologists, neuroradiologists and vascular surgeons on duty in emergency departments enrolled 96 patients who underwent very early CEA according to a predefined protocol within two years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The protocol included evaluation of neurological status by National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS), neuroimaging assessment, ultrasound of the carotid arteries and Transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with NIHSS&gt;22 or whose neuroimaging showed brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> &gt;2/3 of the middle cerebral artery territory were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eligible patients underwent CEA as soon as possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary end points of the study were mortality, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301721" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological morbidity</z:e> by NIHSS and postoperative hemorrhagic conversion on neuroimaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed by univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean time elapsing between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and endarterectomy was 1.5 days (+/-2 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall 30-day morbidity mortality rate was 7.3% (7/96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No neurological mortality occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On hospital discharge, three patients (3%) experienced worsening of the neurological deficit (NIHSS score 1 to 2, 1 to 3 and 9 to 10 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Postoperative CT demonstrated there were no new cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> nor hemorrhagic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At hospital discharge 9/96 patients (9%) had no improvement in NHISS scores, 37 were asymptomatic and 45 showed a median decrease of 4.5 NIHSS points (range 1-18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>By univariate analysis none of the considered variables influenced the clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our protocol selected patients who can safely undergo very early (&lt;1.5 days) surgery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Large randomized multicenter prospective trials are warranted to compare very early CEA versus best medical therapy </plain></SENT>
