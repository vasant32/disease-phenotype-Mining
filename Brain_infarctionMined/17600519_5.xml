<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Red ginseng root (Panax Ginseng CA Meyer) has been used clinically by many Asian people for thousands of years without any detrimental effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the major components of Red ginseng root is ginsenoside Rb(1) (gRb1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously, we showed that intravenous infusion of gRb1 ameliorated ischemic brain damage through upregulation of an anti-apoptotic factor, Bcl-x(L) and that topical application of gRb1 to burn wound lesion facilitated wound healing through upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we produced dihydroginsenoside Rb1 (dgRb1), a stable chemical derivative of gRb1, and showed that intravenous infusion of dgRb1 improved spinal cord injury (SCI) as well as ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As we expected, the effective dose of dgRb1 was ten times lower than that of gRb1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intravenous infusion of dgRb1 at this effective dose did not affect brain temperature, blood pressure or cerebral blood flow, suggesting that dgRb1 rescued damaged neurons without affecting systemic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In subsequent in vitro studies that focused on dgRb1-induced expression of gene products responsible for neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or survival, we showed that dgRb1 could upregulate the expression of not only Bcl-x(L), but also a potent angiogenic and neurotrophic factor, VEGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also showed that dgRb1-induced expression of bcl-x(L) and VEGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was HRE (<z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> response element) and STRE (signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (Stat5) response element) dependent, respectively </plain></SENT>
