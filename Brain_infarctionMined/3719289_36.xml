<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence suggests that poststroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> is associated with the location of the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, proximity to the frontal pole being associated with greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> following left hemisphere injury, and an opposite relationship being seen with injury to the right hemisphere </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> was assessed following recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with localized right (n = 16) or left (n = 19) hemisphere lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No overall differences between these groups were found on several measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although there appeared to be a negative linear relationship between severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and distance of the lesion from the frontal pole in left hemisphere patients, this association failed to attain statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A curvilinear relationship was evident in right hemisphere patients, with anterior and posterior lesions associated with high <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data support the notion that lesion location is associated with the severity of poststroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, although the nature of this association may be more complex than has previously been suggested </plain></SENT>
