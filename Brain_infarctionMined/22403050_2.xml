<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Systemic administration of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and TLR9 <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> before <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> have been shown to reduce ischemic injury by reprogramming the response of the brain to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to explore the mechanism of TLR-induced neuroprotection by determining whether a TLR7 <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> also protects against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: C57Bl/6, TNF(-/-), interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 7(-/-), or type I IFN receptor (IFNAR)(-/-) mice were subcutaneously administered the TLR7 <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> Gardiquimod (GDQ) 72 hours before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume and functional outcome were determined after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma cytokine responses and induction of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for IFN-related genes in the brain were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IFNAR(-/-) mice also were treated with the TLR4 <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi>) or the TLR9 <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results show that GDQ reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume as well as functional deficits in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GDQ pretreatment provided robust neuroprotection in TNF(-/-) mice, indicating that TNF was not essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GDQ induced a significant increase in plasma IFNÎ± levels and both IRF7(-/-) and IFNAR(-/-) mice failed to be protected, implicating a role for IFN signaling in TLR7-mediated protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our studies provide the first evidence that TLR7 preconditioning can mediate neuroprotection against ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we show that the mechanism of protection is unique from other TLR preconditioning ligands in that it is independent of TNF and dependent on IFNAR </plain></SENT>
