<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the pathology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has been a major difficulty in assessing new treatments for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and contributes to the complexity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, such as small vessel (lacunar) disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>New technology such as advanced brain imaging has transformed our knowledge of large vessel disease and we suggest that other new technology such as detailed analysis of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vessels may provide new insights into the pathology of small vessel (lacunar) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesise that <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> microvascular signs differ by pathological <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype, and we plan to test this hypothesis in over 1000 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: Eligible patients undergo a standardised neurological assessment followed by digital <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> photography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At a consensus meeting, an anatomical and aetiological classification is determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> photographs will be assessed qualitatively (e.g. <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> emboli, arteriovenous nicking) and quantitatively (arteriolar/venule ratio) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six-month vascular event rates together with disability and vital status are collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> vessel appearances may provide a 'window' to the brain and help determine the important underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of small vessel disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
