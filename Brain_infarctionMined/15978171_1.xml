<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the expression of mu-calpain in a model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion and the efficacy of the calpain inhibitor A-558693 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery was produced in male Wistar rats by using the suture model with 3 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 24 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six animals were given the calpain inhibitor and six animals were treated with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was determined by the loss of the calpain substrate microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) immunohistochemistry using volumetry in serial slices of the brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore mu-calpain positive-stained cells were detected by immunohistochemistry and western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In placebo-treated animals the mu-calpain expression was significantly increased in the ischemic hemisphere compared with the contralateral non-ischemic hemisphere (88.6 versus 10.5% in the basal ganglia, 60.7 versus 10.7% in the cortex, p &lt; 0.001, respectively) with a subsequent loss its substrate MAP-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the use of the calpain inhibitor A-558693 did not significantly change the mu-calpain expression, nor significantly reduce the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The present data indicate that mu-calpain proteolysis plays an important role in the chain of events following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the calpain inhibitor A-558693 failed to prevent these changes </plain></SENT>
