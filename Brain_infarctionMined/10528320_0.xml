<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between CS and LI in patients with criteria of localized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the carotid territory separately analyzing isolated LI and multiples LIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred and thirty patients with a first episode of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the area supplied by the carotid artery were registered prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 205 LI (135 isolated and 70 multiple) which could be differentiated from 125 non-lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (NLI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The vascular risk factors were determined and the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> measured by duplex-colour ultrasound exploration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the isolated LI group the frequency of presentation of CS greater than 50% was 22% for the artery ipsilateral to the LI and 8% for the contralateral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For significant CS (&gt; 70%) frequencies of 14% (ipsilateral) and 8% (contralateral) were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On comparative analysis with the NLI group, the presence of stenosis greater than 50 to 70% was significantly higher in these for both ipsilateral and contralateral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the LI group, isolated CS was significantly more frequent on the side which was homolateral to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> as compared to its isolated presence on the contralateral side (22/30 vs 4/12; OR: 5.5 [95% CI: 1.2-23]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral CS greater than 70% behaved as a factor which was significantly associated with the multiple LI subtype with a unilateral pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CS should be considered a risk factor for LI </plain></SENT>
