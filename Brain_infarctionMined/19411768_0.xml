<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its aim is to facilitate clinical decision making during diagnosis and treatment of patients presenting to the therapist with cervicocranial pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rather than focusing on a traditional view of premanipulative testing as the cornerstone for decision making, we present information concerning the clinical presentation of specific vascular conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we discuss the assessment and management of musculoskeletal pain in the presence of risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that vascular "red flag" presentations mimic neuromusculoskeletal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376378" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cervicocranial syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Invariably, the 2 conditions coexist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This reasoning presupposes that some patients who have poor clinical outcomes, or a serious adverse response to treatment, may be those who actually present with undiagnosed vascular pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We use 2 case reports to demonstrate how incorporating vascular knowledge into clinical reasoning processes may influence clinical decision making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 5 </plain></SENT>
