<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this process, endothelial damage is probably involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), are involved in endothelial repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By restoring the damaged endothelium, EPC could mitigate SIL and cerebral small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Haptoglobin 1-1, one of three phenotypes of haptoglobin, relates to SIL and may therefore attenuate the endothelial repair by EPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to quantify EPC number and function and to assess haptoglobin phenotype and its effect on EPC function in patients with a high prevalence of SIL: lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We assessed EPC In 42 lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and 18 controls by flow cytometry and culture with fetal calf serum, patient and control serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We determined haptoglobin phenotype and cultured EPC with the three different haptoglobin phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that EPC cluster counts were lower in patients (96.9 clusters/well +/- 83.4 (mean +/- SD)), especially in those with SIL (85.0 +/- 64.3), than in controls (174.4 +/- 112.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cluster formation was inhibited by patient serum, especially by SIL patient serum, but not by control serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with haptoglobin 1-1 had less clusters in culture, and when haptoglobin 1-1 was added to EPC cultures, cluster numbers were lower than with the other haptoglobin phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, especially those with SIL, have impaired EPC cluster formation, which may point at decreased endothelial repair potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The haptoglobin 1-1 phenotype is likely a causative factor in this impairment </plain></SENT>
