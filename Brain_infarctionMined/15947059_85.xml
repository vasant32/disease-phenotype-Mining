<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between measures of cerebral small-vessel disease on MRI and the rate of decline in specific cognitive domains in participants from the prospective, population-based Rotterdam Scan Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were 60-90 years of age and free from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at baseline in 1995-1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>White matter lesions (WML), cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002283'>generalized brain atrophy</z:hpo> were assessed on the baseline MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed neuropsychological testing at baseline and repeatedly in 1999-2000 and in 2001-2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used random-effects models for repeated measures to examine the association between quantitative MRI measures and rate of decline in measures of global cognitive function, information processing speed, executive function and memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were a total of 2266 assessments for the 832 participants in the study, with an average time from the initial to last assessment of 5.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increasing severity of periventricular WML and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002283'>generalized brain atrophy</z:hpo> and the presence of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on MRI were associated with a steeper decline in cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These structural brain changes were specifically associated with decline in information processing speed and executive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The associations between MRI measures of cerebral small-vessel disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> did not change after additional adjustment for vascular risk factors or depressed mood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After exclusion of participants with an incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, some of the associations of periventricular WML, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002283'>generalized brain atrophy</z:hpo> with measures of information processing speed and executive function were no longer significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This may indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> plays an intermediate role in the relationship between cerebral small-vessel disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that in older people cerebral small-vessel disease may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> by affecting information processing speed and executive function </plain></SENT>
