<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mismatches between tissue perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI; an index of blood flow deficit) and cellular diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI; an index of tissue injury) provide information on potentially salvageable penumbra tissue in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and can identify "treatable" <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present pre-clinical studies were conducted to: a.) Determine PWI (using perfusion delay) and DWI measurements in two experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models, b.) Utilize these measurements to characterize selective ET(A) receptor antagonism (i.e., determine efficacy, time-to-treatment and susceptibility to treatment in the different <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models), and c.) Determine if increasing the reduced blood flow following a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is a mechanism of protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) or sham surgeries were produced in Sprague Dawley rats (SD; proximal MCAO; hypothesized to be a model of slowly evolving brain injury with a significant penumbra) and in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR; distal MCAO; hypothesized to be a model of rapidly evolving brain injury with little penumbra) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Infusions of vehicle or SB 234551 (3, 10, or 30 microg/kg/min) were initiated at 0, 75, and/or 180 min post-surgery and maintained for the remainder of 24 h post-surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hyper-intense areas of perfusion delay (PWI) in the forebrain were measured using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">Gadolinium</z:chebi> (Gd) bolus contrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DWI hyper-intense areas were also measured, and the degree of forebrain DWI-PWI mismatch was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Region specific analyses (ROI) were also conducted in the core ischemic and low perfusion/penumbra areas to provide indices of perfusion and changes in the degree of tissue perfusion due to SB 234551 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 24 h post-surgery, final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured by DWI and by staining forebrain slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following SD proximal MCAO, there was a significant mismatch in the ischemic forebrain PWI compared to DWI (PWI&gt;DWI) at 60 min which was maintained up to 150 min (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By 24 h post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was identical to the area of early perfusion deficit/PWI, suggesting a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slow progression</z:hpo> of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> development that expanded into the significant, earlier cortical penumbra (i.e., model with salvageable tissue with potential for intervention) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When SB 234551 was administered within the period of peak mismatch (i.e., at 75 min post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>), SB 234551 provided significant dose-related reductions in cortical (penumbral) progression to infarction (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cortical protection was related to an increased/normalization of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced decrease in tissue perfusion in cortical penumbra areas (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No SB 234551-induced changes in reduced tissue perfusion were observed in the striatum core ischemic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Also, when SB-234551 was administered beyond the time of mismatch, no effect on cortical penumbra progression to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In comparison and strikingly different, following SHR distal MCAO there was no mismatch between PWI and DWI (PWI=DWI) as early as 60 min post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, with this early change in SHR DWI being identical to the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at 24 h, suggesting a rapidly occurring brain injury with little cortical penumbra (i.e., model with little salvageable tissue or potential for intervention) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In distal MCAO, SB 234551 administered immediately at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> did not have any effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that selective blockade of ET(A) receptors is protective following proximal MCAO in SD (i.e. a model similar to "treatable" clinical patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The protective mechanism appears to be due to enhanced collateral blood flow and salvage of penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the use of PWI-DWI mismatch signatures can identify treatable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models characterized by a salvageable penumbra and can define appropriate time to treatment protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In addition, tissue perfusion information obtained under these conditions might clarify mechanism of protection in the evaluation of protective compounds for focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
