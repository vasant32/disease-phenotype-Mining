<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Among 662 consecutive carotid endarterectomies eight cases of postoperative ipsilateral intracerebral haemorrhage were identified, occurring into brain areas which, preoperatively were without infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As blood pressures across the stenosis were routinely measured during surgery, the internal carotid artery (ICA) perfusion pressure could be related to the occurrence of haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, cerebral blood flow (CBF) was studied with the intravenous <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-133 technique in four patients and histopathologic examination of the brain was available in four patients who died subsequent to their haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eight patients had a high grade of ICA stenosis and a marked reduction of ICA perfusion pressure (average of 40%) which was significantly greater than that observed (average of 6%) in the other patients undergoing carotid surgery (P less than 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relative hyperperfusion of the ipsilateral hemisphere was seen in the four patients studied postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In at least two cases the haematoma was preceded by an asymptomatic postoperative ischaemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histologic examination did not confirm previous findings of changes resembling those seen in malignant hypertensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results substantiate the view, that patients at risk of haemorrhage after endarterectomy are those with a low preoperative cerebral perfusion pressure and postoperative hyperperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> is an additional risk factor </plain></SENT>
