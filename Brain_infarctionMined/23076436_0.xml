<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a homebound elderly sample, the numbers of either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> subtypes were similar between those <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E4 allele (ApoE4) carriers (n = 80) and noncarriers (n = 243) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that the higher the number of SV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, but not LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, a participant had, the higher the activity of substrate V degradation in serum especially among ApoE4 carriers (Î² = +0.154, SE = 0.031, P &lt; .0001) after adjusting for the confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since substrate V degradation could be mediated by insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) or/and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), but no relationship was found between SV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and specific ACE activities, blood IDE may be a useful biomarker to distinguish the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin-degrading enzyme in blood may also imply an important biomarker and a pathological event in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> through SV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the presence of ApoE4 </plain></SENT>
