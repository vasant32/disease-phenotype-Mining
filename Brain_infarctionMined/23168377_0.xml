<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic stroke</z:hpo> accounts for approximately 80% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the thrombolytic tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the only treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> that exists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This led researchers to develop several <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> models in a variety of species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two major types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent models</z:e> have been developed: models of global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> or focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To mimic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in patients, in whom approximately 80% thrombotic or embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occur in the territory of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), the intraluminal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model is quite relevant for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This model was first developed in rats by Koizumi et al. in 1986 (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because of the ease of genetic manipulation in mice, these models have also been developed in this species (2-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Herein, we present the transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion procedure in C57/Bl6 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have reported that physical properties of the occluder such as tip diameter, length, shape, and flexibility are critical for the reproducibility of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Herein, a commercial silicon coated monofilaments (Doccol Corporation) have been used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Another great advantage is that this monofilament reduces the risk to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhages</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Using the Zeiss stereo-microscope Stemi 2000, the silicon coated monofilament was introduced into the internal carotid artery (ICA) via a cut in the external carotid artery (ECA) until the monofilament occludes the base of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Blood flow was restored 1 hour later by removal of the monofilament to mimic the restoration of blood flow after lysis of a thromboembolic clot in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The extent of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> may be evaluated first by a neurologic score and by the measurement of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Ischemic mice were thus analyzed for their neurologic score at different post-reperfusion times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, staining with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) was usually performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Herein, we used <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi> staining since it offers the opportunity to test many critical markers by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In this video, we report the MCAO procedure; neurological scores and the evaluation of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
