<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-eight subjects, including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, who were believed to be at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk, were the study subjects and included 70 white and 28 black subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sac I polymorphic S2 allele frequency was higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher levels of serum cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> (P &lt; .05) and significantly lower levels of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> (P &lt; .05) were present in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-risk group with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our study showed the following: Sac I polymorphism frequency was significantly higher in black than white subjects (chi 2 = 3.92, P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">Triglyceride</z:chebi> level was significantly higher in white subjects compared with black subjects (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In white subjects, carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> was associated with significantly <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>elevated total cholesterol</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> levels (P &lt; .01) but not with Sac I polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In black subjects, the reverse was seen with the Sac I polymorphic S2 allele associated with carotid bifurcation stenosis but did not reach statistical significance because of the small number of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, Sac I polymorphism did not correlate with any <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pst I polymorphism was not associated with an abnormal atherogenic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile or carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> in white subjects is associated with increased plasma total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> levels and an atherogenic profile but not with Sac I polymorphism for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13850">apoprotein</z:chebi> AI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In black subjects, Sac I polymorphism appears to identify individuals with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, a necessary precursor to atherothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, but not those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>elevated total cholesterol</z:hpo> or <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and/or reduced <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Sac I polymorphism may identify black subjects at increased risk for atherothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
