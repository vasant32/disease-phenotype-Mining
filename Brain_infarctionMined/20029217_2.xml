<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: Between 50 and 70% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> survivors suffer from severe disabilities such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Poor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome is a reflection of our incomplete understanding of the underlying mechanisms, and hence the capacity to implement appropriate treatment(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated hypoxic tissue after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and patient condition severity and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Hypoxic tissue volume was quantified within 14 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified as hypoxic positive or negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated at imaging and 21 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prognosis was assessed at 30 and 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant improvement was shown in <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-positive (vs. <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-negative) patients (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were significant positive relationships between the volume of hypoxic tissue and the improvement in specialized test scores at 90 days (p &lt; 0.05 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Presence of hypoxic tissue within 14 days after cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was related to recovery at 3 weeks and prognosis at 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of hypoxic tissue volume after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may be useful in predicting patient recovery </plain></SENT>
