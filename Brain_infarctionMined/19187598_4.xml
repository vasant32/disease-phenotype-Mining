<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The neuroprotective effect of the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor has been demonstrated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> neurodegenerative processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But its function under cerebral ischemic conditions is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate the neuroprotective efficacy of emulsified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5130">flurbiprofen</z:chebi> axetil (FA, COX inhibitor) and its therapeutic time window in a model of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-eight male SD rats were randomly assigned into six groups (n = 8 in each group); three FA groups, vehicle, sham and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion (I/R) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three doses of FA (5, 10 or 20 mg/kg, intravenous infusion) were administered just after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion (I/R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of neurological outcome was measured by the neurologic deficit score (NDS) at 24, 48 and 72 hours after I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume percentage (MBIVP) was determined with 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining at 72 hours after I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In three other groups (n = 8 in each group), the selected dosage of 10 mg/kg was administrated intravenously at 6, 12 and 24 hours after I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The three different doses of FA improved NDS at 24, 48 and 72 hours after I/R and significantly reduced MBIVP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the degree of MBIVP in the FA 20 mg/kg group differed from that in FA 10 mg/kg group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of interest is the finding that the neuroprotective effect conferred by 10 mg/kg of FA was also observed when treatment was delayed until 12 - 24 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: COX inhibitor FA is a promising therapeutic strategy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and its therapeutic time window could last for 12 - 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> reperfusion, which would help in lessening the initial ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
