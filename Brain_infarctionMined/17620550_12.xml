<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> with subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> (CADASIL) is a hereditary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> caused by mutations of the Notch3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease is characterized by T2-hyperintense lesions (subcortical white matter lesions), T1-hypointense lesions (lacunar lesions), and T2*-weighted gradient-echo (GE) lesions (cerebral microhemorrhages [CMs]) visualized on clinical MRI sequences and is considered as a model of "pure" subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although numerous studies have investigated the impact of white matter lesions in patients with CADASIL, the clinical importance of lacunar lesions remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to examine the influence of the visible MRI markers in the disease, including the load of lacunar lesions on <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and disability in CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We collected clinical data from 147 consecutive patients enrolled in an ongoing two-center prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Degree of disability was assessed by modified Rankin scale and Barthel index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> was assessed by Mattis <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating Scale and Mini-Mental Status Examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>T1-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and GE images were obtained on a 1.5-T MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Volume and location of lacunar lesions, white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), and CMs were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant independent association between age, volume of lacunar lesions, and global cognitive function scales when analyzed in a multivariable model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, WMHs and CMs had no independent influence on cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Disability in this cohort was associated with volume of lacunar lesions, CMs, systolic blood pressure, and age but not with WMHs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among the lesions observed on conventional MRI in cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> with subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> (CADASIL), the overall lacunar lesion burden seems to have the most important impact on cognitive function and disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that preventive strategies to decrease the risk of lacunar lesions as observed on MRI may reduce disease-related impairment in CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that lacunar lesions may also play a key role in disability and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in more common forms of small-vessel disease </plain></SENT>
