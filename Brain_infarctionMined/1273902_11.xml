<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Of 135 patients who were resuscitated after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> and who died from one day to several weeks later with morphological signs of systemic cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0002316'>anoxia</z:mp>, there were seven patients (5.2%) with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> probably caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0520541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypotensive episodes</z:e> during or after the resuscitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was almost no increase in the frequency of recent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> with an increasing degree of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (P greater than 0.90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the distribution of ten old brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the same material showed a significant correlation to the degree of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that the combination of cerebral atherosclerotic stenoses and hypotensive is not a major cause of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in elderly people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the risk of precipitating brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> by lowering BP in hypertensive patients is not much greater in atherosclerotic than in nonatherosclerotic subjects </plain></SENT>
