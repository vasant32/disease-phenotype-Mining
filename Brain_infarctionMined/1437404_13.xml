<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> given before global ischemic forebrain injury to adult rats increases morphologic brain damage, and postischemic insulin administration reduces selective neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and cortical infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusions are routinely used in the clinical management of perinatal asphyxia, we evaluated the role of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> administration after ischemic neuronal damage to neonatal rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rat pups (postnatal d 7) were subjected to left common carotid artery ligation followed by 2.5 h of 8% oxygen (Levine procedure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The experimental group was subdivided so that pups received either systemic injections of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or saline immediately after the hypoxic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals were killed on postnatal d 12 and brain areas of ipsi- and contralateral cortex and caudate were calculated from camera lucida tracings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in size of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> between postischemic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-treated and post-ischemic saline-treated pups </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> does not attenuate and may exacerbate injury, we recommend careful monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> so that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> does not occur during resuscitation of asphyxiated infants </plain></SENT>
