<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In primary cerebellar neurons, Con-G was shown to decrease excitotoxic calcium responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> and to exhibit differential neuroprotection potencies against <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>-, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28051">veratridine</z:chebi>-induced injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the intraluminal filament method of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> as an in vivo rat model of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, the neuroprotective dose-response effect of Con-G administration beginning 30 min postocclusion was evaluated after 2 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 22 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the core region of injury, an 89% reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was measured with significant neurological and electroencephalographic recovery at the maximal dose tested (2 nmol), although mild sedation was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lower doses of Con-G (0.001-0.5 nmol) were significantly neuroprotective without causing sedation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postinjury time course experiments demonstrated a therapeutic window out to at least 4 to 8 h from the start of the injury, providing a 47% reduction in core injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effect of Con-G (0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>5 nmol) was also evaluated after 72 h of injury, where a 54% reduction in core <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Critically, in both recovery models (i.e., 24 and 72 h), the reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was associated with significant improvements in neurological and electroencephalographic recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data provide evidence for the potent and highly efficacious effect of Con-G as a neuroprotective agent, with an excellent therapeutic window for the potential intervention against ischemic/excitotoxic brain injury </plain></SENT>
