<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, we evaluated the impact of the passage of MSCs on their effects in a rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The i.v. application of ex vivo-cultured human MSCs, earlier (passage 2) or later passage (passage 6), was performed in a rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Behavioral tests, immunohistochemical studies, and quantitative analysis using the CAST-grid system were performed to evaluate the degree of neurogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated the levels of trophic factors in both control and MSC-treated rat brain extract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to rats that received later-passage human MSCs, behavioral recovery and neurogenesis as revealed by bromodeoxyuridine staining were more pronounced in rats that received earlier-passage human MSCs (p &lt; 0.01 in both cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Double staining showed that most of the endogenous neuronal progenitor cells, but few human MSCs, expressed neuronal and glial phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tissue levels of trophic factors, including glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and hepatocyte growth factor, were higher in earlier-passage MSC-treated brains than in control or later-passage MSC-treated brains (p &lt; 0.01 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced neurogenesis was enhanced by the i.v. administration of human MSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effects were more pronounced with earlier-passage than with later-passage human MSCs, which may be related to the differential capacity in trophic support, depending on their passage </plain></SENT>
