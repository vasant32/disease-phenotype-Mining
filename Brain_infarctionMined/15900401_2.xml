<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We developed an MRI protocol to measure cerebrovascular diameter and blood flow velocity, and if we could detect cerebrovascular alterations after SAH and their impact on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: SAH was induced in 15 Wistar rats by means of the endovascular filament method; 6 other rats served as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRI measurements were performed on a 4.7T NMR spectrometer 1 and 48 hours after SAH and 9 days thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted and T2-weighted images were acquired to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The arterial spin labelling method was used to measure CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography was used to measure vessel diameter and blood flow velocity, from which the arterial blood flow was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: The ischemic lesion volume increased between 1 and 48 hours after SAH from 0.039 to 0.26 ml (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CBF decreased from 53.6 to 39.1 ml/100 g/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The vessel diameter had narrowed, the blood flow velocity diminished as did the arterial blood flow in most vessels, but only the vasoconstriction in the right proximal ICA reached significance (0.49 mm to 0.43 mm, P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Baseline values were restored at day 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We showed that it is feasible to detect alterations of in-vivo vessel diameter and blood flow velocities and their consequences for brain damage after experimental SAH in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The growth of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume between day 0 and 2 after SAH and the parallel vasoconstriction suggest that delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> after SAH occurs in rats and that this may be caused by vasoconstriction </plain></SENT>
