<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The origin and significance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>blood hyperviscosity</z:hpo> in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has been controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been argued that viscous abnormalities simply reflect either elevated hematocrit or an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase response to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address these issues, we measured the factors that determine blood viscosity in a cross-sectional study of 430 subjects, including 135 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 89 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> of the brain, 115 with recognized risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and 91 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The at-risk group was balanced with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group for types of risk factors and medication usage, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four groups were balanced for age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The viscosity of whole blood at low rates of shear and the plasma viscosity were significantly elevated in both groups with cerebrovascular symptoms and in the at-risk group compared with the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The severity of hyperviscosity was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group greater than <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> group greater than at-risk group greater than healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased viscosity of whole blood was associated with an elevated plasma fibrinogen concentration and with a decreased albumin/globulin ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study provides evidence that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>blood hyperviscosity</z:hpo> is present not only in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, but also in those with risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and that these abnormalities are, to a considerable degree, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
