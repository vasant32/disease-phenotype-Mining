<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Adrenomedullin (AM) and its binding protein, complement factor H (FH), are expressed throughout the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we used a brain-specific conditional knockout for AM and a complete knockout for FH to investigate the effect of these molecules on the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following 48 h of middle cerebral artery permanent occlusion, there was a statistically significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size increase in animals lacking AM when compared to their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, lack of FH did not affect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate some of the mechanisms by which lack of AM may augment brain damage, markers of nitrosative stress, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and autophagy were studied at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase of inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), fractin, and Beclin-1 in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area of AM-deficient mice when compared to their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> counterparts and to contralateral and sham-operated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that AM exerts a neuroprotective action in the brain and that this protection may be mediated by regulation of iNOS, matrix metalloproteases, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the future, substances that increase AM actions in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system may be used as potential neuroprotective agents in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
