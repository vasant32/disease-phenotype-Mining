<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our previous study demonstrated that crocin, a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="23044">carotenoid</z:chebi> pigment of saffron, can suppress the serum deprivation-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of PC12 cells by increasing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) synthesis and thus inhibiting neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase) activity and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="23044">carotenoid</z:chebi> pigments of saffron consist of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3918">crocetin</z:chebi> di-(beta-d-glucosyl)-<z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> [dicrocin], <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3918">crocetin</z:chebi>-(beta-d-gentiobiosyl)-(beta-d-glucosyl)-<z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> [tricrocin] and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3918">crocetin</z:chebi>-di-(beta-d-gentiobiosyl)-<z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> [crocin] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Saffron also contains <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53168">picrocrocin</z:chebi>, the substance causing saffron's bitter taste </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, to confirm whether neuroprotective effects of saffron are caused solely by crocin, we examined the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> and GSH-synthetic activities of these crocins in PC12 cells under serum-free and hypoxic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measurements of cell viability, peroxidized membrane <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and caspase-3 activity showed that the rank order of the neuroprotective potency at a concentration of 10 muM was crocin&gt;tricrocin&gt;dicrocin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53168">picrocrocin</z:chebi> (the latter two crocins had a little or no potency) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we show that among these saffron's constituents, crocin most effectively promotes <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of gamma-glutamylcysteinyl synthase (gamma-GCS), which contributes to GSH synthesis as the rate-limiting enzyme, and that the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="23044">carotenoid</z:chebi> can significantly reduce infarcted areas caused by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) in mice </plain></SENT>
