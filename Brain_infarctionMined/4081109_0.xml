<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MRI with long SE mode clearly showed the ischemic lesion at 18 hours after insult, whereas X-CT performed immediately after MRI scanning showed no abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The signal contrast of the lesion with long SE mode seemed to increase slightly during the patient's course, for a period of several months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The MRI images with long SE at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage were varied: small lesions appeared as hot areas, whereas large lesions appeared as cold areas and were accompanied with signal enhancement in the surrounding areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A phantom study was also performed and it was determined that MRI was superior to X-CT in its ability to detect tissue water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of the reasons for the high diagnostic capability of MRI for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was, therefore, attributed to this experimental result </plain></SENT>
