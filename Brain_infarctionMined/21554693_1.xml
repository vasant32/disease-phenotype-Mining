<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268579" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Propionic acidaemia</z:e> (PA) results from deficiency of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15539">Propionyl CoA</z:chebi> carboxylase, the commonest form presenting in the neonatal period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite best current management, PA is associated with severe neurological sequelae, in particular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100022'>movement disorders</z:hpo> resulting from basal ganglia infarction, although the pathogenesis remains poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The role of liver transplantation remains controversial but may confer some neuro-protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study utilises quantitative magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to investigate brain metabolite alterations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268579" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">propionic acidaemia</z:e> during metabolic stability and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> encephalopathic episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Quantitative MRS was used to evaluate brain metabolites in eight children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003623'>neonatal onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268579" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">propionic acidaemia</z:e>, with six elective studies acquired during metabolic stability and five studies during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> encephalopathic episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRS studies were acquired concurrently with clinically indicated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging studies at 1.5 Tesla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LCModel software was used to provide metabolite quantification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparison was made with a dataset of MRS metabolite concentrations from a cohort of children with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MRI findings confirm the vulnerability of basal ganglia to infarction during <z:hpo ids='HP_0006846'>acute encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We identified statistically significant decreases in basal ganglia <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>+glutamine and N-Acetylaspartate, and increase in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, during encephalopathic episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In white matter <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> was significantly elevated but other metabolites not significantly altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Metabolite data from two children who had received liver transplantation were not significantly different from the comparator group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The metabolite alterations seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268579" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">propionic acidaemia</z:e> in the basal ganglia during <z:hpo ids='HP_0006846'>acute encephalopathy</z:hpo> reflect loss of viable neurons, and a switch to anaerobic respiration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The decrease in glutamine + <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> supports the hypothesis that they are consumed to replenish a compromised Krebs cycle and that this is a marker of compromised aerobic respiration within brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thus there is a need for improved brain protective strategies during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> metabolic decompensations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>MRS provides a non-invasive tool for which could be employed to evaluate novel treatments aimed at restoring basal ganglia homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The results from the liver transplantation sub-group supports the hypothesis that liver transplantation provides systemic metabolic stability by providing a hepatic pool of functional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15539">propionyl CoA</z:chebi> carboxylase, thus preventing further <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> decompensations which are associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
