<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects were 164 patients scheduled to undergo carotid artery stenting: a DPB was used in 82 cases (DPB group) from April 2007 until June 2010, and a DPF was used in 82 cases (DPF group) from July 2010 to July 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rates of positive findings on postoperative diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Positive postoperative DWI results were found in 34 cases in the DPB group (41.4 %), but in only 22 cases in the DPF group (26.8 %), and there was only a small significant difference within the DPF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the DPB group, there was one case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) (1.2 %) and four cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (2 minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, 2 major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>; 4.9 %), compared to the DFP group with one case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (1.2 %) and no cases of minor or major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, significantly lower rates of occurrence of DWI ischemic lesions and intraoperative embolization were associated with use of the DPF compared to the DPB </plain></SENT>
