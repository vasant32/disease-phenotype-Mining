<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether increased levels of physical activity could reduce brain damage in rats subjected to transient or permanent middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (three months old, n=36) exercised on a treadmill, which required repetitive locomotor movement, for 30 min each day for three weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, using an intraluminal filament, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was induced by either 2-h <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion followed by two days of reperfusion or by <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion for two days without reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain damage was determined by evaluating neurologic deficits and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In rat with transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, pre-ischemic motor activity significantly (p&lt;0.01) reduced neurologic deficits and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the frontoparietal cortex and the dorsolateral striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the same exercise procedure did not produce neuroprotection in the permanently <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-occluded <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition to decreasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk and incidence, physical activity also reduces brain damage after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although we cannot completely rule out a neuroprotective effect on ischemic episode, our study suggests that a major neuroprotection is conferred during reperfusion for rats that have undergone exercise pre-conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This exercise-induced endogenous neuroprotection may be an effective strategy to ameliorate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion brain injury from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
