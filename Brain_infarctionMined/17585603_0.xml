<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After admission, the symptoms disappeared rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRI diffusion-weighted image on day one revealed high intensity area at the right insular cortex and MRA showed stenosis of the right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRA on the next day demonstrated that the stenotic lesion improved, but another stenosis appeared at the petrous portion of the right internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain angiography on day eight showed improvement of the stenosis of the right ICA petrous portion and stenosis of bilateral ICAs extracranial distal portion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The transoral carotid ultrasonography (TOCU) on day nine showed clearly true lumen and false lumen at the bilateral extracranial distal ICAs, which indicated spontaneous dissection of the bilateral extracranial distal ICAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TOCU seems very useful in evaluating the extracranial carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
