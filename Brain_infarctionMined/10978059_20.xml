<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to develop a new model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> based on endothelial damage and thrombotic occlusion in a perforating artery, leading to small cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and neurological deficits in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the neuroprotective efficacy of fasudil, a rho-kinase inhibitor, was investigated in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi>, and 100 microg of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18262">laurate</z:chebi> was injected into the left internal carotid artery on days 1 and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> induction and consequent of ischemic brain damage were examined by histopathological analyses and neurological deficit scoring in a posture reflex test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To investigate the neuroprotective effects of fasudil, 1 or 10 mg/kg was administered intraperitoneally 5 minutes after the first injection of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18262">laurate</z:chebi> and once daily thereafter on the following 2 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hour after the injection of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18262">laurate</z:chebi>, microscopic examination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53394">phosphotungstic acid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-stained sections (n=5) revealed that microthrombi containing fibrin strands obstructed the perforating arteries in the ipsilateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Under a transmission electron microscope (n=6), endothelial cells appeared exfoliated and the vascular lumen was obstructed by a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> composed of degranulated platelets, fibrin, leukocytes, and erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No evidence of endothelial cell damage or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> could be found in the ipsilateral side of the pial artery (middle cerebral artery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after the second injection of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18262">laurate</z:chebi> (day 4), 13 of 15 rats (86.6%) showed mild to severe neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multiple small cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were observed in the hippocampus, cortex, and thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment with fasudil (1 and 10 mg/kg, n=15 each) resulted in a significant improvement in neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Fasudil also significantly reduced the area of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We present a new model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats, in which the perforating arteries are selectively occluded by microthrombi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This model is useful to investigate the pathophysiology and treatment of small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, which is caused by perforating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003838" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial occlusive diseases</z:e> such as lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Fasudil may be beneficial in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
