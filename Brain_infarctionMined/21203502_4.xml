<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Treatments to improve the neurological outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> are severely limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we present the first in vivo single cell images of cortical mouse astrocytes documenting the impact of single vessel photothrombosis on cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The volume of astrocytes expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) increased by over 600% within 3 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subsequent growth of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was easily followed as the loss of GFP fluorescence as astrocytes lysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and the magnitude of ischemic lesions were significantly reduced by treatment with the purinergic ligand 2-methylthioladenosine 5' <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (2-MeSADP), an <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> with high specificity for the purinergic receptor type 1 isoform (P2Y(1)R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 24 hours, cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in astrocytes was still apparent at the penumbra and preceded the cell lysis that defined the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Delayed 2MeSADP treatment, 24 hours after the initial <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, also significantly reduced cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and the continued growth of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological and genetic evidence are presented indicating that 2MeSADP protection is mediated by enhanced astrocyte <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> metabolism via increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> trisphosphate (IP(3))-dependent Ca(2+) release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that mitochondria play a critical role in astrocyte energy metabolism in the penumbra of ischemic lesions, where low ATP levels are widely accepted to be responsible for cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Enhancement of this energy source could have similar protective benefits for a wide range of brain injuries </plain></SENT>
