<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A case of a 47-year-old man with a sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of a bizarre and random fire-setting behavior is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The man, who had been arrested on felony arson charges, complained of difficulties concentrating and of recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Axial T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed a low intensity lacunar lesion in the genu and anterior limb of the left internal capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A neuropsychological test battery revealed lower than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> scores for executive functions, attention and memory, consistent with frontal lobe dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of fire-setting behavior and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> nature of the lacunar lesion, together with an unremarkable performance on tests measuring executive functions two years prior, suggested a causal relationship between this organic brain lesion and the fire-setting behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present case describes a rare and as yet unreported association between random impulse-driven fire-setting behavior and damage to the left internal capsule and suggests a disconnection of frontal lobe structures as a possible pathogenic mechanism </plain></SENT>
