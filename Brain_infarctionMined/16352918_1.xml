<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Enhanced expression of a kidney-specific <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> co-transporter (NKCC2: Na-K-2Cl co-transporter) in the thick ascending limb of Henle has been identified in rat models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> and liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo>, suggesting that high NKCC2 expression underlies <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An increased abundance of NKCC2, however, has also been noted in rats with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021141" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SIADH">syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone</z:e>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>hyponatremia</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined NKCC2 expression in non-edematous disease, such as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, and investigated the physiological and/or pathological characterization of NKCC2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We initially examined NKCC2 expression in an animal model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mongolian gerbils (around 60 g body weight) underwent bilateral clamping of the common carotid arteries for 5 min for the induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NKCC2 and apical water channel (AQP2) protein levels in the collecting duct were examined by Western blotting in kidney tissues 2, 7, and 14 days after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gerbils with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> were then fed either a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> low-<z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> diet (0.3 g/kg/day) or a high-<z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> diet (3.0 g/kg/day), and body weight, urine volume and urinary osmolality were examined daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood parameters were measured on day 14 after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Histochemical examination of the brain confirmed the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, as manifested by altered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi> staining in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Protein levels of NKCC2 were significantly increased in gerbils with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> on days 2 and 7 after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, whereas AQP2 protein signals remained unaltered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the increased NKCC2 intensity disappeared on day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> was slightly, but significantly greater in gerbils with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> than in sham-operated gerbils up to 7 days after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The high-<z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> diet resulted in significant urinary concentration and enhanced <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> in infarcted gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We noted increased NKCC2 abundance in non-edematous disease, which enhanced body <z:mpath ids='MPATH_106'>fluid accumulation</z:mpath>, likely via the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> loading-dependent concentration of the urine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the physiological process of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation is based on specific NKCC2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The transient duration of these findings in the present animal model suggests two different characteristics of specific NKCC2 expression, an immediate, transient appearance as a common response in serious conditions and more <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> expression that leads to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
