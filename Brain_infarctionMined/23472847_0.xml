<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Object Decompressive craniectomy is a life-saving measure for patients who have sustained traumatic brain injury (TBI), but patients undergoing this procedure may still die during an early phase of head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence, causes, and risk factors of 30-day mortality in traumatically brain-injured patients undergoing decompressive craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods The authors included 201 head-injured patients undergoing decompressive craniectomy in this 3-year retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main outcome evaluated was 30-day mortality in patients who had undergone craniectomy after TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic and clinical data, including information on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, were obtained for subsequent analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors identified differences between survivors and nonsurvivors in terms of clinical parameters; multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust for independent risk factors of short-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results The 30-day mortality rate was 26.4% in traumatically brain-injured patients undergoing decompressive craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> following decompression resulted from uncontrollable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> and extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, which accounted for 79.2% of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate logistic regression mode, the 2 independent risk factors for 30-day mortality were age (OR 1.035 [95% CI 1.006-1.064]; p = 0.018) and Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale (GCS) score before decompressive craniectomy (OR 0.769 [95% CI 0.597-0.990]; p = 0.041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions There is a high 30-day mortality rate in traumatically brain-injured patients undergoing decompressive craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> are attributed to ongoing brain damage, even after decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Risk factors of short-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, including age and preoperative GCS score, are important in patient selection for decompressive craniectomy, and these factors should be considered together to ensure the highest chance of surviving TBI </plain></SENT>
