<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The temporal relationship between atrial tachyarrhythmias (atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> [AT] and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> [AF]) and cerebrovascular events/systemic emboli (CVE/SE) is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate this relationship using stored AT/AF diagnostic data from implanted devices in patients with and those without AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The TRENDS study enrolled 2,486 patients with an indication for an implantable device, at least one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factor, and available device data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The current study includes the subgroup of 40 (1.6%) patients enrolled in TRENDS who experienced CVE/SE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AT/AF was detected prior to CVE/SE in 20 (50%) of 40 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other than average and maximum daily AT/AF burden and duration of device monitoring prior to CVE/SE, no statistically significant differences were found between patients with and those without AT/AF prior to CVE/SE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the 20 patients with AT/AF detected prior to CVE/SE, 9 (45%) did not have any AT/AF in the 30 days prior to CVE/SE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, 29 (73%) of 40 patients with CVE/SE had zero AT/AF burden within 30 days prior to CVE/SE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourteen (70%) of the 20 patients with AT/AF detected prior to CVE/SE were not in AT/AF at diagnosis of CVE/SE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The last episode of AT/AF in these 14 patients was 168 Â± 199 days (range 3-642 days) before CVE/SE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The majority of CVE/SE in this population did not occur proximal to recent AT/AF episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data imply that the mechanisms of CVE/SE in patients with implantable devices may importantly involve mechanisms other than cardioembolism due to atrial tachyarrhythmias </plain></SENT>
