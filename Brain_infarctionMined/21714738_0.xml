<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a patient who showed selective impairment of emotional experience only in listening to music, that is musical anhednia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 71-year-old right-handed man developed an infarction in the right parietal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He found himself unable to experience emotion in listening to music, even to which he had listened pleasantly before the illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In neuropsychological assessments, his intellectual, memory, and constructional abilities were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Speech audiometry and recognition of environmental sounds were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuromusicological assessments revealed no abnormality in the perception of elementary components of music, expression and emotion perception of music </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI identified the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> lesion in the right inferior parietal lobule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that emotional experience of music could be selectively impaired without any disturbance of other musical, neuropsychological abilities </plain></SENT>
