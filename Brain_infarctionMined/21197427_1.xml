<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, accumulating lines of evidence showed that dietary enrichment with nutritional <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> could reduce brain damage and improve cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, possible protective effect of Zingiber officinale, a medicinal plant reputed for neuroprotective effect against <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>-related brain damage, on brain damage and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficit</z:e> induced by focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male adult Wistar rats were administrated an alcoholic extract of ginger rhizome orally 14 days before and 21 days after the permanent occlusion of right middle cerebral artery (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cognitive function assessment was performed at 7, 14, and 21 days after MCAO using the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and density of neurons in hippocampus were also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the level of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GSH-Px) in cerebral cortex, striatum, and hippocampus was also quantified at the end of experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed that cognitive function and neurons density in hippocampus of rats receiving ginger rhizome extract were improved while the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cognitive enhancing effect and neuroprotective effect occurred partly via the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity of the extract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our study demonstrated the beneficial effect of ginger rhizome to protect against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
