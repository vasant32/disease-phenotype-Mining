<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There are limited data on the long-term outcome and on factors influencing the prognosis in patients with cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> treated with surgical decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two patients (age 64.3 ± 9.9 years) with expansive unilateral cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were retrospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with ventriculostomy, suboccipital decompressive craniectomy and removal of the necrotic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale (GCS) and the Reaction Level Scale (RLS) scores evaluated the level of consciousness during hospitalization, while the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was used for the 6-month and long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Predicting factors were analyzed using a univariate logistic regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median time from ictus to surgery was 48.4 h (range 8-120 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Before surgery, the median GCS score was 9 (3-13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At discharge, the GCS score improved to 13.6 (7-15) (p &lt; 0.05 compared to preoperative scores) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the long-term follow-up (median 67.5 months), ten patients were dead, and 77% of survivors had a good outcome (mRS score of ≤2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number of days on a ventilator and the GCS score prior to surgery and at discharge were strong predictors of clinical outcome (p &lt; 0.05), although one third of patients with a GCS ≤ 8 at the time of surgery had a good long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients ≥70 years old, 50% had a good long-term outcome, and advanced age was not associated with a bad result (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results imply that surgical evacuation of significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarctions</z:e> may be considered also in patients with advanced age and/or a decreased level of consciousness </plain></SENT>
