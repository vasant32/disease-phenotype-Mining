<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: As the third most frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of VTE and steps for its prevention in acutely ill hospitalized elderly Chinese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective multi-center study was conducted from June 2006 to November 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 607 patients from 40 research centers in China were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data of the patients' baseline characteristics, VTE events and prophylaxis/therapy methods were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients (9.7%) had an objectively confirmed VTE during the 90-day follow-up, of which, 59.3% occurred during the first week and 75% within 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-one patients died (6.6%) during the follow-up, 36.6% died within three weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also found that medical disorders including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> (16.4%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (15.6%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious diseases</z:e> (14.3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary artery syndrome (8.7%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (7.6%) play a role in provoking VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 13.0% of the elderly patients with high risk of VTE used low dose unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, 7.1% used low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, 5.4% used <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, 0.3% used graduated compression stockings and none of them used intermittent pneumatic compression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed similar results between our study and western countries in the VTE incidence by day 90 in elderly hospitalized patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> medical illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Great caution must be applied in the care of acutely ill elderly hospitalized patients to deal with the complications of VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Application of safe and effective prophylaxes against embolism remains a critical challenge </plain></SENT>
