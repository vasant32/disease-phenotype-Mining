<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One way to protect neurons from injury is through the use of cell-permeant calcium buffers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These molecules have been reported to be neuroprotective via their ability to increase the cell's overall Ca(2+) buffering load as well as by attenuating neurotransmitter release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, their efficacy when given after injury has yet to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI), histological, and immunohistochemical methods to determine the neuroprotective efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18112">2-aminophenol</z:chebi>-N, N, O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16558">triacetic acid</z:chebi> acetoxymethyl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> (APTRA-AM) after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Injured animals were given two injections of APTRA-AM at 1 and 12 h after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals were imaged prior to injury and then at 12, 24, 48 h and 3 and 7 days after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 7 days the animals were euthanized for correlative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi> histology and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Injury resulted in a decrease in the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) of the injured area within the first 12 h of injury, which returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> by 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, animals injected with APTRA-AM showed no significant change in the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> at any time point studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Tissue analysis showed that APTRA-AM significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size by 85% and extent of inflammatory cell infiltration by 94% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results clearly demonstrate significant neuroprotection by APTRA-AM when given after injury </plain></SENT>
