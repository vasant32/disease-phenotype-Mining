<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a combined procedure of burr hole evacuation and craniotomy, we treated 2 cases of multiple traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our policy for such cases is first to perform a burr hole evacuation for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> in the emergency room, while simultaneously preparing the operation room for a possible further operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Next, we perform computed tomography (CT) of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If the evacuation does not provide enough decompression, we either carry out a craniotomy at the same site, or, we observe the patient without resorting to craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, if the patient's condition deteriorates, burr hole evacuation is repeated and/or craniotomy is carried out as soon as possible on the lesion at the already prepared operation room </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both of our patients received craniotomy for another <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> after the burr hole evacuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Though his intracranial pressure was well managed during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage, one of the patients died 21 days after the trauma due to an extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> caused by vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The other regained consciousness and was able to walk 5 months after the trauma in spite of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> from vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The possible mechanism of vasospasm in severe head injury is also discussed </plain></SENT>
