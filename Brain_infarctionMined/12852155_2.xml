<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Leukocyte migration into the ischemic area is a complex process, controlled by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules (AM) in leukocytes and endothelium, by migratory capacity of leukocytes and the presence of hemotaxic agents in the tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this research it was supposed that in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> (IBD) there were relevant changes in the concentration of soluble AM (sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and sE-selectin), that could have been the indicators of the intensity of damaging processes in central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 45 IBD patients, 15 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>), 15 with reversible ischemic attack (RIA), and 15 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (BI), of both sexes, mean age 66 +/- 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control group consisted of 15 patients with radicular lesions of discal origin, subjected to diagnostic radiculography, without the signs of interruption in the passage of CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes of selected biochemical parameters were determined in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in frame 72 hours since the occurrence of an ischemic episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of soluble AM were determined in plasma and CSF by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total number of leukocytes (TNL) in peripheral blood was determined by hematological analyzer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results showed that during the first 72 hrs of IBD significant increases occurred in TNL and that the increase was progressive compared to the severeness of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant increase of soluble AM concentration was shown in plasma of IBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The increase was highest in BI, somewhat lower in RIA and the lowest in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients compared to the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In CSF concentrations of sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and sE-selectin demonstrated similar increasing trend as in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TNL, as well as the soluble AM concentrations in plasma and CSF, were increased during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> IBD phase and progressive in relation to the severeness of the disease, so that they might have been the indicators of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> inflammatory reaction intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the results indicated their role in IBD pathogenesis and offered the possibility of researching the application of <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> and/or activity modulators of some of them in IBD therapy </plain></SENT>
