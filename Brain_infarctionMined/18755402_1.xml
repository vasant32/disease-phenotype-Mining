<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The principal features of the cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, failure of coordination, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002317'>gait instability</z:hpo>, and articulation and eye movement disabilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023015" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Language disabilities</z:e> are also seen with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar lesions</z:e>, but there are difficulties in diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was planned to evaluate the effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar lesions</z:e> on language functions and the relation between these functions and lesion type, age, and education level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 20 patients, 13 male (65%) and 7 female (35%), were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty control subjects with similar demographic characteristics were also included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the patient group was not statistically different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with vermal lesions had significantly higher performance than patients with paravermal lesions when evaluating the understanding of hearing and total <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Understanding of reading function was significantly better in the patients with small lesions compared with those with large lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> parameters were compared between the patient and control groups, significant differences were found for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parameters, which reflected the language abilities understanding, naming, true-wrong questions, complex questions, comparing, repeating, and total <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reading and writing functions were also significantly different between the patients and the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found that the cerebellum contributes in several language parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These functions show difference according to localization and lesion volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>Aphasia</z:hpo> should be explored as an important parameter when evaluating the loss of function in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
