<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such damage also results in impairments and compensatory changes in the less-affected/ipsilesional forelimb, but these effects remain poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, anesthetization of the ipsilesional hand in humans with cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> has been reported to produce transient functional improvements in the paretic hand [Floel A, Nagorsen U, Werhahn KJ, Ravindran S, Birbaumer N, Knecht S, et al </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One aim of this study was to sensitively assay the bilateral effects of unilateral ischemic SMC damage on performance of a unimanual skilled reaching task (the single pellet retrieval task) that rats had acquired pre-operatively with each forelimb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The second aim was to determine whether partially recovered contralesional reaching function is influenced by anesthetization of the ipsilesional forelimb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Unilateral SMC lesions were found to result in transient ipsilesional impairments in reaching success and significant ipsilesional abnormalities in reaching movements compared with sham-operates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were major contralesional reaching impairments which improved during a 4 week training period, but movements remained significantly abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Anesthetization of the ipsilesional forelimb with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> at this time attenuated the contralesional <z:mp ids='MP_0001388'>movement abnormalities</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that unilateral ischemic SMC lesions impair skilled reaching behavior in both forelimbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, after partial recovery in the contralesional forelimb, additional improvements can be induced by transient anesthetization of the ipsilesional forelimb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the effects of unilateral anesthetization in humans which have been attributed to the modulation of competitive interhemispheric interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The present findings suggest that such interactions are also likely to influence skilled reaching function in rats </plain></SENT>
