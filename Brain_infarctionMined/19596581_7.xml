<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent experiments in rat spinal cord <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> showed that remyelination was specific to intravenous delivery of the bone marrow-derived mononuclear cell (BM-MNC) fraction, although the specific role of this fraction in peripheral nerve regeneration has not been examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore we evaluated the role of BM-MNCs in peripheral nerve regeneration in the rat sciatic nerve transection model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After anesthesia, the right sciatic nerve of 20 adult-male Wistar rats was transected under an operating microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the test group, the cut ends of the nerve were approximated with two epineural microsutures, the gap was filled with rat BM-MNCs and the approximated nerve ends were covered with fibrin glue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the control group, the transected nerve ends were repaired with two epineural microsutures and fibrin sealant only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histological assessment of the nerve was performed 30 days and 60 days after the operation and regenerative changes were compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The recovery after nerve anastamosis was far better in the test group at both 30 days and 60 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003450'>axonal regeneration</z:hpo>, remyelination and myelin thickness at sites 5mm and 10mm from the site of repair of the nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Schwann cell proliferation and degenerative changes were more prevalent in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that local delivery of BM-MNCs (which can be isolated easily from bone marrow aspirates) into injured peripheral nerve increases the rate and degree of nerve regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present study highlights the role of BM-MNCs in peripheral nerve regeneration </plain></SENT>
