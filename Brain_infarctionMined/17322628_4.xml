<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The present study investigated serial changes in platelet activation (expressed by CD62p) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (VWF), and the correlation between increased CD62p expression, VWF and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (BIV: measured by magnetic resonance imaging), and prognostic determinants in non-valvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (NVAF) patients after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (IS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: CD62p expression and plasma VWF concentrations were serially measured (&lt;48 h, on days 7, 21 and 90) using flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> IS in 61 NVAF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD62p expression and VWF concentrations were also examined in 50 NVAF-risk control and 30 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The VWF concentration had no significant changes at 4 intervals among the patients and did not differ among 3 groups at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD62p expression was significantly higher in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase after IS than in both control groups (both p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, CD62p expression declined to a significantly lower level on day 7 and to a substantially lower level thereafter (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD62p expression did not differ on day 90 in the 3 groups (both p&gt;0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analysis showed that BIV and modified Rankin scale score (&gt;3) were independently associated with increased CD62p expression (&lt;48 h) (both p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the Cox proportional hazards model showed that BIV was the only independent predictor of intermediate-term (8.8+/-4.4 months) combined recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The CD62p expression, which reflected increased BIV, was significantly increased in NVAF patients in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase IS and substantially declined thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The BIV was predictive of unfavorable intermediate-term clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
