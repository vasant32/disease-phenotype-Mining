<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the domain-specific quality of life (QOL), including physical, social and role functioning, mental health, vitality, bodily pain, and general health domains, and to assess QOL's clinical and sociodemographic correlates in patients who were disabled by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: One-year prospective study of an inception cohort of patients with first-ever <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> unit of a neurologic department of a university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Eighty-five consecutive patients (36 women, 49 men; mean age +/- SD, 65+/-12.5 yr) with first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of a mild to moderate nature caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients were examined at 3 and 12 months poststroke </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>QOL was measured using the RAND 36-Item Health Survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The variables studied were lateralization of cerebral lesion, neurologic and functional status, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, age, gender, marital status, and living conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> was evaluated according to the criteria of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e>, Revised Third Edition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurologic impairment was assessed by Scandinavian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale, performance in activities of daily living by the Barthel index, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>intellectual deterioration</z:hpo> by the Mini-Mental State Examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: QOL was poorer for the patients with mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> impairments at 3 months poststroke </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The test domains most prone to being affected were physical functioning, physical role limitations, vitality, and general health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only the domains of physical functioning and physical role limitations improved during the follow-up at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo>, although mostly minor, was the most important reason for impaired QOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo>, being married, and age emerged as significant independent contributors to the low score value of vitality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> and being married were related to the low score value of physical role limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> affects QOL, impairing its physical and psychosocial domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The most important determinants of low QOL seem to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and being married </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These findings provide new challenges for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rehabilitation, calling for identification of patients and spouses in need of supportive services </plain></SENT>
