<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about mixed pathologies in probable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) and about the spectrum of neuropathology in mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to investigate single and mixed common age-related neuropathologies in persons with probable AD and MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 483 autopsied participants from the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project with probable AD (National Institute of Neurological and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009460" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Communicative Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> and Related Disorders Association criteria), MCI (amnestic and nonamnestic), or no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We excluded 41 persons with clinically possible AD and 14 with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We documented the neuropathology of AD (National Institute on Aging-Reagan criteria), macroscopic cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and neocortical Lewy body (LB) disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 179 persons (average age, 86.9 years) with probable AD, 87.7% had pathologically confirmed AD, and 45.8% had mixed pathologies, most commonly AD with macroscopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (n = 54), followed by AD with neocortical LB disease (n = 19) and both (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 134 persons with MCI, 54.4% had pathologically diagnosed AD (58.7% amnestic; 49.2% nonamnestic); 19.4% had mixed pathologies (22.7% amnestic; 15.3% nonamnestic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Macroscopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> without pathologically diagnosed AD accounted for 4.5% of probable AD, 13.3% of amnestic MCI, and 18.6% of nonamnestic MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pure neocortical LB disease was uncommon in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (&lt;6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Microscopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (without macroscopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>) were common as a mixed pathology, but rarely accounted for a clinical diagnosis of probable AD (n = 4) or MCI (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Clinically diagnosed probable AD and MCI, even amnestic MCI, are pathologically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disorders, with many persons exhibiting mixed pathologies </plain></SENT>
