<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>MEK1/2 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that phosphorylates and activates extracellular signal-responsive kinase (ERK)1/2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we explored the role of MEK1/2 in ischemic brain injury using a selective MEK1/2 inhibitor, SL327, in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a 30-min occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis demonstrated the immediate activation of MEK/ERK after reperfusion (within the first 10 min) in the ischemic brain; this activation was dose dependently blocked by SL327 (10-100 mg/kg, i.p.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A single dose of SL327 (100 mg/kg) administered 15 min before or 25 min after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> resulted in 63.6% (n = 18, p &lt; 0.001) and 50.7% (n = 18, p &lt; 0.01) reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, respectively, compared with vehicle-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, SL327 significantly reduced neurological deficits 1 to 3 days after reperfusion (n = 12, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The salutary effect of SL327-induced neuroprotection was independent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release or caspase-8-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>; however, SL327 markedly suppressed the levels of active caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation (as a measure of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>) after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the inhibition of MEK1/2 results in neuroprotection from reperfusion injury and that this protection may be associated with the reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
