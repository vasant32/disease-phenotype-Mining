<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated if utilization of decompressive surgery changed in the Czech Republic (CZ) after the release of new guidelines regarding treatment of malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The volume of decompressive surgery in 2009 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> centers in the CZ was assessed using the same methodology as in 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> neurosurgery departments in the CZ were asked to complete a questionnaire and asked to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of decompressive surgery for malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> through a combination of discharge codes for "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>" and "decompressive surgery" from electronic hospital charts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data for 56 patients were obtained from 15 of the 16 neurosurgery departments in the CZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average age was 53 ± 13; number of males 20; median time to surgery was 48 h (range 24-62); median NIHSS score was 25 (IQR, 20-30); median <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was 300 cm(3) [interquartile (IQR, 250-350)]; mean shift on CT was 10.6 ± 3.6 mm and size of hemicraniectomy was 125 cm(2) (IQR, 110-154) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on data from one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> center, 10% suffered from malignant supratentorial infarction and 2.3% met the criteria for decompressive surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 2009, as compared to 2006, the volume of decompressive surgery carried out moderately increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, procedures remained underutilized because only ~10% of those who needed decompressive surgery underwent surgery </plain></SENT>
