<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using TCT and [(99m)Tc]ethyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32457">cysteinate</z:chebi> dimer (<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp>)-SPECT within 6 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, we examined 108 patients (44 women, 64 men; mean age 65+/-13 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> attributed to the territory of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In each case, 3 experts prospectively evaluated the early SPECT and TCT images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We correlated these ratings with follow-up TCT findings for the final infarction as well as with clinical outcome (Scandinavian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale, Barthel Index, Modified Rankin Scale) after 30 and 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Severe activity deficits on SPECT, not caused by local <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> on TCT, were the best predictors (positive predictive value [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> ]94%, 95% CI 89% to 99%; negative predictive value [NPV] 90%, 95% CI 78% to 100%; P&lt;0.001) for evolving <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complete <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarctions were predicted with significantly higher accuracy with early SPECT (area under receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] index 0.91) compared with early TCT (AUC index 0.77) and clinical parameters (AUC index 0.73, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis revealed 1 independent predictor for completed <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory infarction: SPECT activity deficits in the corresponding areas (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> 88%, 95% CI 65% to 100%; NPV 96%, 95% CI 92% to 100%; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was optimally predicted by [(99m)Tc]<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp>-SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome up to 90 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> event best correlated with the degree of activity deficits in early SPECT (r=0.53, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: [(99m)Tc]<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> brain perfusion SPECT that completes TCT definitely improves the predictive value of brain imaging after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the combined imaging of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and of cerebral perfusion early after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is recommended for clinical use </plain></SENT>
