<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Sickle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (SCA) frequently results in damage to the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>), but the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of these effects is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed MRI examinations of the brain in infants with SCA, who were evaluated as part of the multicenter randomized double-blinded Pediatric <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">Hydroxyurea</z:chebi> Phase III Clinical Trial (BABY HUG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Determination of eligibility for enrollment in the trial originally required baseline MRI and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A standardized imaging protocol was utilized across eight clinical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI/MRA exams were reviewed by a panel of three neurology/neuroradiology readers and interpretations reported to the coordinating center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results were correlated with patient age, gender, history, WBC count, platelet count, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb), HbF level, score on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, and velocity on transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-three subjects with HbSS were examined at average age 13.7 months (range 10-18 months); 13 were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three (13%, CI: 3-34%) had silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on MRI, two in the right frontal area and one bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None had MRA abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lesions were correlated with increased right-sided TCD velocity and low HbF level, but not with age, history, Hb level, developmental score, or left-sided velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> occur in a small but significant number of infants with SCA as early as a year of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This finding indicates a need for thorough evaluation of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> very early in life in children with SCA in order to develop timely intervention strategies </plain></SENT>
