<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The Mongolian gerbil is one of the main animal species used for the study of global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, due to its specific Circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of their anatomic variations, a large number of animals is needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On account of the specific vulnerability of the hippocampus, striatum and neocortex, it is possible to evaluate the severity of the ischemic damage through an analysis of locomotor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The tests support the sensitvity of the experimental sample and compensate the interanimal variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The locomotor pattern of 30 male Mongolian gerbils was recorded before they were subjected to experimental bilateral carotid clippage for 15 minutes followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A transparent 75x50x90 cm acrylic box was filmed in order to determine the total distance covered by the animals in five minutes, for three consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The locomotor activity of the animals was also examined in an open field at 24 hours and seven days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum neurospecific enolase (NSE) was measured in the ischemic group and compared with that of an intact control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The recording for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals was uniformly similar (average 200 squares in periphery), in the first trial of 3 consecutive days (188+/-6.7 S.D.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the numbers increased to 388 (+/- 40 S.D.), indicating that they were sensitive to the ischemic episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven days later they returned to basal values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Serum NSE was high in the ischemic group versus the intact control group (S=&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Locomotor activity in an open field is a useful reference as a predictive test to determine the sensitivity of experimental animals to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is also associated to the degree of cerebral damage in global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion, and this behavior is representative of the expression of selective ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The determination of NSE is useful as an associated parameter of ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
