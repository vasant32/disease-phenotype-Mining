<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the thalamus is prone to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, only a single patient with bilateral DM infarctions was reported to have odor abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe a second such patient with infarctions involving the left DM and the right ventral posterior nucleus and ventral lateral nucleus, nuclei adjacent to the DM, associated with transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the previous case, our patient had transient odor abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These observations suggested that direct and/or indirect bilateral involvement of the DM might be associated with odor abnormalities in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
