<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The inclusion of systematic neuropathologic analysis in this study has resulted in a greater understanding of the role of Alzheimer and vascular pathology in the expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and has provided data showing that biomarkers for the pathology may be evident many decades earlier in adult life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Findings related to neuropathology in this study have included the following: (1) Although clinical outcomes were strongly correlated with Alzheimer neuropathology, about one-third of the participants fulfilling criteria for neuropathologic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) were not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(4) A linguistic characteristic of essays written in early adult life, idea density, had a strong association with not only clinical outcomes in late life, but the severity of Alzheimer neuropathology as well </plain></SENT>
