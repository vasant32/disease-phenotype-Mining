<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty adult-male SD rats were equally divided into sham control (group 1), IS plus intra-peritoneal physiological saline (at 0.5/24/48 h after IS) (group 2), IS plus CsA (20.0 mg/kg at 0.5/24h, intra-peritoneal) (group 3), IS plus EPO (5,000IU/kg at 0.5/24/48h, subcutaneous) (group 4), combined CsA and EPO (same route and dosage as groups 3 and 4) treatment (group 5) after occlusion of distal left internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BIA on day 21 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> IS was higher in group 2 than in other groups and lowest in group 5 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sensorimotor functional test showed higher frequency of left turning in group 2 than in other groups and lowest in group 5 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expressions of apoptotic markers and number of apoptotic nuclei on TUNEL were higher in group 2 than in other groups and lowest in group 1 and 5, whereas the anti-apoptotic markers exhibited an opposite trend (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expressions of inflammatory and oxidized protein were higher in group 2 than in other groups and lowest in group 1 and 5, whereas anti-inflammatory markers showed reversed changes in group 1 and other groups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of aquaporin-4+ and glial fibrillary acid protein+ stained cells were higher in group 2 as compared to other groups and lowest in groups 1 and 5 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: combined treatment with CsA and EPO was superior to either one alone in protecting rat brain from ischemic damage after IS </plain></SENT>
