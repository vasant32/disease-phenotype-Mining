<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A case patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> is presented, who developed what appeared to be cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on MRI, but these lesions vanished on repeat imaging 16 days later, questioning their aetiology as vascular ischaemic based <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
