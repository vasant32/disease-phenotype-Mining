<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A systematic literature search was conducted until June 30, 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The American Heart Association <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Council's Levels of Evidence grading algorithm was used to grade each recommendation (Table 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The guideline was revised after several official meetings with local experts, and was reviewed by 3 expert reviewers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis of malignant large hemispheric infarction (MLHI) is critical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Studies have shown that using computed tomography (CT) or transcranial sonography to track midline shifting of the cerebrum and applying diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging might contribute to the early recognition of MLHI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">Glycerol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> should be administered only when a patient shows evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> or mass effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> on improving prognosis is inconclusive and requires close monitoring of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, using steroids on patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is not recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> on reducing intracranial pressure is rapid but short-lived, and is used only in emergency situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The target levels of PaCO2 are 30-35 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (32-34Â°C) may be effective in controlling intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, but should be used cautiously along with rigorous monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Timely decompressive craniectomy can probably offer patients a better chance of survival and quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Usually, surgery for MLHI is indicated in patients with clinical deterioration associated with a significant mass effect, as observed on neuroimaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, with a reliable indicator of MLHI, early decompressive craniectomy before clinical deterioration may further reduce mortality and lead to a better functional outcome </plain></SENT>
