<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Subclinical brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (SBI) is associated with subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A longitudinal epidemiological study suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> may prevent development of SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> upon development of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> by performing a post-hoc analysis of the Regression of Cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>Artery Stenosis</z:mp> (ROCAS) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The ROCAS study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> 20 mg daily upon progression of asymptomatic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> among <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free individuals over 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 227 subjects were randomized to either placebo (n = 114) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> 20 mg daily (n = 113) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> as detected by MRI was recorded at baseline and at the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was the number of new brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> at the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 227 randomized subjects, 33 (14.5%) had SBI at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the end of the study, significantly fewer subjects in the active group (n = 1) had new brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> compared with the placebo group (n = 8; p = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The new brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of subjects in the active group were subclinical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the placebo group, the new brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of 3 subjects were symptomatic while those of the remaining 5 subjects were subclinical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among putative variables, multivariate regression analysis showed that only the baseline number of SBIs (OR = 6.27, 95% CI 2.4-16.5) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> treatment (OR = 0.09, 95% CI 0.01-0.82) independently predicted the development of new brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with findings of the epidemiological study, our study suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> may prevent the development of a new brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
