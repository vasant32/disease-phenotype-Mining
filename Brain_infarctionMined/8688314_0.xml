<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the prevalence and mechanisms of postoperative silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, brain CT was routinely performed before and after carotid endarterectomy during the same period of hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between June 1991 and May 1993, 69 patients who underwent 74 carotid endarterectomies (five two-staged bilateral procedures) were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was observed on the preoperative CT scans in 25 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these 25 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, three occurred in 20 patients (15%), without symptoms, 13 in 41 patients (32%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>), and 9 in 13 patients (70%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After surgery, two patients (2.7% of procedures) had monoparesia of an upper limb with no corresponding abnormality seen on CT scans, and two (2.7%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>, associated with CT evidence of a new lesion in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (6.8%) were detected, including four in the hemisphere contralateral to the restored carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These study results indicate there is no correlation between the occurrence of postoperative silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and the presence of ulcerated stenosis of the carotid artery documented by Doppler ultrasound examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was not observed in any of the 24 patients (32%) in whom a shunt had been used during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After a review of the literature, we propose wider use of intraoperative shunts to prevent postoperative silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
