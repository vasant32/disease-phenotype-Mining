<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To measure plasma thrombospondin1 (TSP1) in thrombotic thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) and other diseases such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant tumor</z:e> et al. and 8 patients after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Then to study on the relationship between TSP1 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor cleaving protease (ADAMTS13); and to identify the significance of plasma TSP1 in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: TSP1 was measured by a commercial kit and the activity of ADAMTS13 was evaluated by residue collagen binding assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TSP1 in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> plasma before plasma exchange or plasma infusion was 6.49 mg/L, and stepping up to 13.02 mg/L after therapy, but still significantly lower than 18.34 mg/L in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While the decrease in different degree of ADAMTS13 activity was observed from 0%-52%, and there were 8 samples whose activity of ADAMTS13 were no more than 10%; the different extent of increase in those patients after therapy was demonstrated to be 2.9%-93.4%, only one patient's ADAMTS13 activity was below 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The activity of ADAMTS13 in some <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> and SLE patients were mildly decreased (63% +/- 16% and 70% +/- 14% respectively), TSP1 were also decreased (16 mg/L +/- 8 mg/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TSP1 in patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> were increased (24.0 mg/L +/- 2.9 mg/L), while ADAMTS13 activity had no significant change (72% +/- 16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Same things happened in BMT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was some concordance between the decrease of ADAMTS13 activity and TSP1 in plasma of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>And the change of TSP1 was restricted to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TSP1 may contribute to the episode of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> in a still unclear fashions </plain></SENT>
