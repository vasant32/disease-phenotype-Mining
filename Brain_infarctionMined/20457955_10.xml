<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The importance of subclinical cerebrovascular disease in the elderly is increasingly recognized, but its determinants have not been fully explicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elevated blood pressure (BP) and fluctuation in BP may lead to cerebrovascular disease through ischemic changes and compromised cerebral autoregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of BP and long-term fluctuation in BP with cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A community-based epidemiological study of older adults from northern Manhattan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: The Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: A total of 686 nondemented older adults who had BP measurements during 3 study visits at 24-month intervals and underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (corresponding temporally with the third assessment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We derived the mean (SD) of the mean BP for each participant during the 3 intervals and divided the participants into 4 groups defined as below or above the group median (&lt;or=96.48 or &gt;96.48 mm Hg) and further subdivided them as below or above the median SD (&lt;or=7.21 or &gt;7.21 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This scheme yielded 4 groups representing the full range of BPs and fluctuations in BP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Differences in white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume and presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> across groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: White matter hyperintensity volume increased across the 4 groups in a linear manner, with the lowest WMH volume in the lowest mean/lowest SD group and the highest WMH volume in the highest mean/highest SD group (F(3,610) = 3.52, P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Frequency of infarction also increased monotonically across groups (from 22% to 41%, P for trend = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with individuals with low BP and low fluctuations in BP, the risk of cerebrovascular disease increased with higher BP and BP fluctuations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Given that cerebrovascular disease is associated with disability, these findings suggest that interventions should focus on long-term fluctuating BP and elevated BP </plain></SENT>
