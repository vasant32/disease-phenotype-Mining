<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their etiology is considered to be cerebral microvascular abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the association between WMHs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> is not yet clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this hospital-based cohort study was to identify the arteriosclerotic characteristics associated with WMHs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We cross-sectionally included 240 consecutive patients with no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We measured the brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), ankle brachial pressure index, and intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery, and we performed magnetic resonance brain imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>WMHs were defined as periventricular hyperintensity (Fazekas grade ≥3) and/or separate deep white matter hyperintense signals (Fazekas grade ≥2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We determined the prevalence of WMHs, silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (SBI), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, and smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We compared 2 groups of patients, defined by the presence or absence of WMHs, using multiple logistic regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In multivariable analysis, SBI (OR 3.38; 95% CI 1.52-7.72), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR 2.23; 95% CI 1.03-5.15), female sex (OR 1.95; 95% CI 1.03-3.76), baPWV (OR 1.12; 95% CI 1.02-1.23), and age (OR 1.09; 95% CI 1.04-1.14) were independently associated with WMHs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An increased baPWV is associated with WMHs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Management of increased baPWV may help to prevent the progression of WMHs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
