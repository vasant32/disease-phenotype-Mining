<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sex, age, HCY level and other vascular risk factors were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI and angiographies were used to determine the type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathies</z:e> and their severity, i.e., the scores of leukoaraiosis (LA), plaques and numbers of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> (SBI) </plain></SENT>
