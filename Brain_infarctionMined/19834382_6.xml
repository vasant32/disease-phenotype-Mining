<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>Intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) is a devastating clinical syndrome for which no truly efficacious therapy has yet been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In preclinical studies, erythropoietin (EPO) and its long-lasting analog, darbepoetin alfa, have been demonstrated to be neuroprotective in several models of neuronal insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to analyze whether the systemic administration of recombinant human EPO (rHuEPO) and its long-lasting derivative darbepoetin alfa expedited functional recovery and brain damage in a rat model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> was induced in rats by injecting autologous blood into the right striatum under stereotactic guidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, animals underwent placebo treatment, daily injections of rHuEPO, or weekly injections of darbepoetin alfa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals were killed 14 days after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both rHuEPO and darbepoetin alfa were effective in reducing neurological impairment after injury, as assessed by the neurological tasks performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>rHuEPO- and darbepoetin alfa-treated animals exhibited a restricted brain injury with nearly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> parenchymal architecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the saline-treated group exhibited extensive cerebral cytoarchitectural disruption and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number of surviving NeuN-positive neurons was significantly higher in the rats treated with rHuEPO and darbepoetin alfa compared with those that received saline (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that weekly administered darbepoetin alfa confers behavioral and histological neuroprotection after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> in rats similar to that of daily EPO administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Administration of EPO and its long-lasting recombinant forms affords significant neuroprotection in an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> model and may hold promise for future clinical applications </plain></SENT>
