<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Green tea <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23053">catechins</z:chebi> possess potent antioxidative properties, and the preventive effects against various oxidative diseases have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to examine preventive and protective effects of green tea <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23053">catechins</z:chebi> on various deteriorative processes following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL/METHODS: Male Wistar rats were given ad libitum water with or without 0.25 and 0.5% tea <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23053">catechin</z:chebi> extract for 5 days prior to the operation and during the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Right middle cerebral artery was occluded for 2 h, then reperfused for 22 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain slices were stained with triphenyltetrazolim <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> to assess <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of plasma EGCg, and serum NOx were analyzed by HPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Detection of iNOS expression, neutrophil infiltration and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> formation in the penumbra was performed by immunostain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurologic deficit was scored by posture reflex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Tea <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23053">catechins</z:chebi> dose-dependently reduced the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was inversely correlated with plasma EGCg concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Dark staining for iNOS, neutrophils and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> were observed in vessel wall of small arteries in control ischemic hemisphere, while in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23053">catechins</z:chebi> (0.5%)-treated rats iNOS was detected slightly, and staining for neutrophils and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> was not seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="23053">Catechin</z:chebi> ingestion blocked a 3-fold increase in serum NOx concentration in the jugular vein, and also reduced by 35% a 2-fold increase of plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxide</z:chebi> level seen in control rats after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Neurologic deficits were significantly alleviated by 0.5% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23053">catechin</z:chebi> ingestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Daily intake of green tea <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23053">catechins</z:chebi> efficiently protects the penumbra from irreversible damage due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and consequent neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
