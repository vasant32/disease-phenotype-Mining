<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It has been hypothesized that algorithms predicting the final outcome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> may provide future tools for identifying salvageable tissue and hence guide individualized therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We developed means of quantifying predictive model performance to identify model training strategies that optimize performance and reduce bias in predicted lesion volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We optimized predictive performance based on the area under the receiver operating curve for logistic regression and used simulated data to illustrate the effect of an unbalanced (unequal number of infarcting and surviving voxels) training set on predicted <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then tested the performance and optimality of models based on perfusion-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and structural MRI modalities by changing the proportion of mismatch voxels in balanced training material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Predictive performance (area under the receiver operating curve) based on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> brain voxels is excessively optimistic and lacks sensitivity in performance in mismatch tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ratio of infarcting and noninfarcting voxels used for training predictive algorithms significantly biases tissue <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> risk estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Optimal training strategy is obtained using a balanced training set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We show that 60% of noninfarcted voxels consists of mismatch voxels in an optimal balanced training set for the patient data presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An equal number of infarcting and noninfarcting voxels should be used when training predictive models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The choice of test and training sets critically affects predictive model performance and should be closely evaluated before comparisons across patient cohorts </plain></SENT>
