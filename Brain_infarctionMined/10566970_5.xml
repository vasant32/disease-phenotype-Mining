<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors examined whether this genetic abnormality is associated with hemodynamic or metabolic alterations in the brain that can be detected before the manifestation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Starting at 6 weeks of age, SHR-SP were fed with a salt-rich diet to accelerate arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the age of 12 weeks, animals developed functional symptoms and were age-matched with symptom-negative SHR-SP to differentiate between presymptomatic and postsymptomatic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brains were investigated by multiparametric imaging comprising quantitative double-tracer autoradiography of CBF and cerebral protein synthesis (CPS); bioluminescence imaging of regional ATP, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> content; and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27510">umbelliferone</z:chebi> fluoroscopic imaging of tissue pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the animals exhibited focal hemodynamic or biochemical abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In symptom-negative SHR-SP, global CBF was 1.1+/-0.3 mL x g(-1) x min(-1), cortical CPS was 10.1+/-3.1 nmol x g(-1) x min(-1), and cortical ATP, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, and pH levels were in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In SHR-SP with functional symptoms, ATP, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> levels also were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but tissue pH exhibited periventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001948'>alkalosis</z:hpo>, CBF was significantly reduced to 0.7+/-0.2 mL x g(-1) x min(-1) (P &lt; 0.001), and cortical CPS was significantly reduced to 6.7+/-2.1 nmol x g(-1) x min(-1) (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The decline in brain perfusion of SHR-SP correlated significantly with both the severity of functional deficits and the decline of protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our observations demonstrate that SHR-SP had already developed functional symptoms before the manifestation of overt brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and that the symptoms are initiated by a decline in global CBF and cortical CPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Genetic abnormalities in SHR-SP are associated with a diffuse vascular process that results in global decompensation of blood flow well before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
