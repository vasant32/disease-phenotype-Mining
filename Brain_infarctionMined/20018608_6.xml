<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is currently no instrument to stratify patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> according to early risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to develop a comprehensive prognostic score to predict 90-day risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed data on 1,458 consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients using a Cox regression model with time to recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as the response and clinical and imaging features typically available to physician at admission as covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 90-day risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was calculated by summing up the number of independent predictors weighted by their corresponding beta-coefficients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The resultant score was called recurrence risk estimator at 90 days or RRE-90 score (available at: http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/RRE-90/) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (54 had baseline imaging) occurred during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk adjusted for time to follow-up was 6.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Predictors of recurrence included admission etiologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype, prior history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and topography, age, and distribution of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The RRE-90 score demonstrated adequate calibration and good discrimination (area under the ROC curve [AUC] = 0.70-0.80), which was maintained when applied to a separate cohort of 433 patients (AUC = 0.70-0.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The model's performance was also maintained for predicting early (14-day) risk of recurrence (AUC = 0.80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The RRE-90 is a Web-based, easy-to-use prognostic score that integrates clinical and imaging information available in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> setting to quantify early risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The RRE-90 demonstrates good predictive performance, suggesting that, if validated externally, it has promise for use in creating individualized patient management algorithms and improving clinical practice in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> care </plain></SENT>
