<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous clinicopathological studies have reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0007110'>central hypoventilation</z:hpo> alongside unilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the caudal brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As already known, the respiratory centers are located in the medullary and pontine centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We sought patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> with brainstem involvement proved by MRI from 4,500 patients with first <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> consecutively admitted to our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit over a period of 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We report six patients with a unilateral dorsolateral medulla oblongata lesion, completely sparing the corticospinal tract, who presented impairments in automatic and voluntary respiratory movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Topographical analysis showed involvement of the nucleus and tractus solitarius,nucleus ambiguus and retroambiguus,nucleus reticularis medulla oblongata, and nucleus tractus solitarius </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide insight into the central organization of respiratory control in the dorsolateral medulla oblongata in humans, and the importance of critical respiratory management in these patients </plain></SENT>
