<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> depolarizations (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi>) have been demonstrated with diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and are regarded as an important mechanism of ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi> are of relevance for the early enlargement of human brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were investigated by repetitive imaging of the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase (7 patients) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase (3 patients) of developing cortical infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each patient, 20 ADC maps were obtained from serially measured echo-planar DWI (interval of 45 seconds) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data analysis focused on the potential spatial and temporal <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> changes, including structured qualitative analysis, calculation of subtraction images, serial analysis of regions of interest positioned in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core and border, and calculation of hemispheric lesion areas, depending on various <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> thresholds ranging between 0 and 800 microm(2)/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data analysis was unable to disclose any time-dependent changes in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> that would resemble <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In ischemic regions, the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> reduction significantly progressed from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> border (555+/-96 microm(2)/s) to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core (431+/-104 microm(2)/s, P:&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: By using an MRI protocol with high temporal resolution and elaborated postprocessing, we were unable to demonstrate a pattern of diffusion changes that would be indicative of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Experimental infarction and human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may differ in the detectability of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
