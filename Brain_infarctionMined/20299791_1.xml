<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (LS) account for 25% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> and are small, deeply located brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two different subtypes exist, which are distinguished by the presence of concomitant white matter lesions (WML) on brain imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We determined the prevalence of MetS in LS and the association between MetS with LS subtypes in a series of first-ever LS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included 92 patients with a first-ever LS, and 92 patients with a first-ever atheroslerotic cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (CS) matched for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LS subtypes were defined according to presence of concomitant WML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We defined MetS retrospectively according to previously defined standards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 35.9% of LS patients and 45.7% of CS patients had MetS (OR 0.67; 95% CI 0.37-1.20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MetS was more prevalent in LS without WML than in LS with WML (44.4 and 23.7%, respectively; OR 2.98; 95% CI 1.04-8.47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, MetS related more to CS compared to LS with WML (OR 2.56; 95% CI 1.03-6.37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MetS relates more strongly to LS without WML and to CS, than to LS with WML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest a different underlying mechanism between LS without WML and CS, and lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with WML </plain></SENT>
