<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is a rare example of callosal alien hand sign associated with a right parietal lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The right parietal lobe appeared to be responsible for the callosal hand sign in this patient, possibly due to interference with peristriate outflow pathways toward the parietal zones, where visual somatosensory interactions are likely to occur </plain></SENT>
