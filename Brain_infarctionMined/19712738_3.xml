<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with 100 mg/kg body weight of the extract by oral gavage for 15 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery was then occluded for 75 min followed by 24 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pretreated rats showed significantly improved neurological behavior with reduced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> when compared to vehicle control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> level in brain was found to be significantly (p&lt;0.05) low in vehicle control rats after 24 h of reperfusion when compared to sham operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in Hawthorn extract pretreated rats the levels were found to be close to that of sham </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Malondialdehyde levels in brain of sham and pretreated group were found to be significantly lower than the non-treated vehicle group (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> levels in brain were measured and found to be significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher in vehicle than in sham or extract treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that Hawthorn extract which is a well known prophylactic for cardiac conditions may very well protect the brain against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reduced brain damage and improved neurological behavior after 24 h of reperfusion in Hawthorn extract pretreated group may be attributed to its <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> property which restores <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> levels, circumvents the increase in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> levels thereby reducing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> formation and free radical induced brain damage </plain></SENT>
