<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A new volumetric coefficient of this area lesion is proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The variants of the clinical course of <z:mp ids='MP_0006052'>cerebellum hemorrhage</z:mp> and infarctions in respect to the coefficient's value were distinguished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The course is considered favorable if the values are less than 0.08 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The higher values indicate, as a rule, a progressive increase of neurological symptoms up to a lethal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results reveal that the volumetric coefficient of the cerebellum lesion is a reliable parameter both for prognosis and for quantitative evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> vascular processes in the cerebellum, allowing taking into account the potentials of reserve intracranial space of the posterior cranial focca as well as individual peculiarities of brain and cranial sizes </plain></SENT>
