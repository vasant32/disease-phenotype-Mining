<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> significantly decreases heart rate variability as a result of cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002271'>autonomic dysregulation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, information regarding circadian rhythms of heart rate and heart rate variability is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this prospective study, we analyzed 24-hour circadian rhythm of heart rate and the time and frequency domain measures of heart rate variability in 24 patients with hemispheric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, 8 patients with medullary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e>, and 32 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ECG data were obtained from the patients in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase and at 6 months after the infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the components of heart rate variability, ie, standard deviation of RR intervals, total power, high-frequency power, low-frequency power, and very-low-frequency power, were similar at night (from midnight to 6 AM) and during the day (from 9 AM to 9 PM), indicating that the circadian oscillation of heart rate variability had been abolished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 6 months after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, the circadian rhythm had returned and, as in the control subjects, the values at night were significantly higher than those in the daytime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The values in hemispheric and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> did not differ significantly from each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that circadian fluctuation of heart rate variability is reversibly abolished in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and that it returns during the subsequent 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The loss of the relative vagal nocturnal dominance may contribute to the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and other cardiovascular complications after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
