<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Enlimomab, a murine monoclonal anti-human intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule (ICAM)-1 antibody, had a negative outcome in a multicenter <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We did a bedside-to-bench study in standardized rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models to explore mechanisms for these untoward results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> in Wistar rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), we administered murine anti-rat ICAM-1 antibody (1A29), subclass-matched murine immunoglobulin (IgG1), or vehicle intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To examine whether rat anti-mouse antibodies were generated against the mouse protein and whether these were deleterious, we sensitized Wistar rats with 1A29 or vehicle 7 days before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume, tissue myeloperoxidase activity, neutrophil CD11b expression, and microvascular E-selectin, P-selectin, and ICAM-1 expression were examined 48 hours after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complement activation was serially assessed for 2 hours after a single injection of either 1A29 or vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 1A29 treatment did not significantly reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in either strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>1A29 sensitization augmented <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and generated rat anti-mouse antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although 1A29 inhibited neutrophil trafficking shown by reduction in brain myeloperoxidase activity, circulating neutrophils were activated and displayed CD11b upregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complement was activated in 1A29-sensitized Wistar rats and 1A29-treated SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>E-selectin (SHR), endothelial P-selectin (Wistar and SHR), and ICAM-1 (SHR) were upregulated in animals treated with 1A29 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Administration to rats of a murine antibody preparation against ICAM-1, 1A29, elicits the production of host antibodies against the protein, activation of circulating neutrophils, complement activation, and sustained microvascular activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These observations provide several possible mechanisms for central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system-related clinical deterioration that occurred when Enlimomab was given in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
