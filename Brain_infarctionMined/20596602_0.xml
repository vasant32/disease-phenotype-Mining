<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To understand its molecular mechanism, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> derivates were intracerebroventricularly administered at 15 min before, and 15, 90, 120 min after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The reduction in mortality and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> at 24 h was seen only with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> administered at 15 min after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The down-regulation of endogenous <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> by the intracerebroventricular injection of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> was found to be responsible for the protective effect on the integrity of blood-brain barrier after MCAO, as well as for the reduction in mortality and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, for the first time we have found that the Kringle-2 domain is essential for the brain-protective activity of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
