<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of common carotid artery measured by B-mode ultrasound sonography and vascular risk factors, in particular the coagulation and fibrinolytic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 118 patients without either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disease</z:e> or symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> are enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vascular risk factors associated with increased intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) of common carotid artery were advancing age, sex (male), systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> with the activity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (vW factor) which had a significant correlation with concentration of beta-thromboglobin (beta TG) and platelet factor 4 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that vW factor is a useful parameter for the evaluation of the extent of vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>vW factor in plasma and in the vessel wall is known to contribute appreciably to the platelet adherence, and to play a major role in the platelet aggregation particularly at high shear stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this study, we showed that plasma vW factor might enhance platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we revealed that plasma vW factor might reflect the injury of carotid artery wall and serve as a significant predictor of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> with concentration of fibrinogen (Fbg), suggesting Fbg may play a role in atherogenesis by affecting local blood flow especially at the bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We reconfirmed that Fbg is a significant indicator of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of beta TG and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi> were significantly correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>They are useful parameters of platelet activation and elevated in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results, therefore, indicate that beta TG and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi> also reflect the injury of carotid artery wall, and could be markers for carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
