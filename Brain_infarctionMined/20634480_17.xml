<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The ABCD system was developed to predict early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Incorporation of brain imaging findings has been suggested, but reports have used inconsistent methods and been underpowered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore performed an international, multicenter collaborative study of the prognostic performance of the ABCD(2) score and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> on imaging to determine the optimal weighting of infarction in the score (ABCD(2)I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve centers provided unpublished data on ABCD(2) scores, presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> on either diffusion-weighted imaging or CT, and follow-up in cohorts of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> diagnosed by World Health Organization criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Optimal weighting of infarction in the ABCD(2)I score was determined using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analyses and random effects meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 4574 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarction was present in 884 (27.6%) of 3206 imaged with diffusion-weighted imaging and new or old infarction was present in 327 (23.9%) of 1368 imaged with CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ABCD(2) score and presence of infarction on diffusion-weighted imaging or CT were both independently predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n=145) at 7 days (after adjustment for ABCD(2) score, OR for infarction=6.2, 95% CI=4.2 to 9.0, overall; 14.9, 7.4 to 30.2, for diffusion-weighted imaging; 4.2, 2.6 to 6.9, for CT; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Incorporation of infarction in the ABCD(2)I score improved predictive power with an optimal weighting of 3 points for infarction on CT or diffusion-weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pooled areas under the curve increased from 0.66 (0.53 to 0.78) for the ABCD(2) score to 0.78 (0.72 to 0.85) for the ABCD(2)I score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In secondary care, incorporation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> into the ABCD system (ABCD(2)I score) improves prediction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
