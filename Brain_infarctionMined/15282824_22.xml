<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, macrophage infiltration in different central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) pathologies has been visualized with ultrasmall particles of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="50820">iron oxide</z:chebi> (USPIO) as a new cell-specific contrast medium for MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, validation of these findings at the histological level has been hampered by the fact that the in situ detection of iron uptake by conventional <z:chebi fb="27" ids="30069">Prussian blue</z:chebi> staining is not sensitive enough to detect low amounts of iron in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, an improved method for the histochemical detection of USPIO uptake in ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The procedure relies on the sequential enhancement of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="30069">Prussian blue</z:chebi> staining by diaminobenzidine and silver/gold impregnation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After photothrombotic cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, this method allowed sensitive in situ detection of iron-laden macrophages which matched both macrophage immunostaining and USPIO-induced signal alterations in high-resolution 7 T MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This staining method provides a basis for correlative histological assessment of USPIO-enhanced MRI in a broad spectrum of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> pathologies </plain></SENT>
