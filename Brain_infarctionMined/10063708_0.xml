<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> has been the second most common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, in Taiwan since 1983 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cost of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to society in terms of morbidity, mortality and economics is profound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Heightened interest in the early diagnosis and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> challenges neuroimagers to optimize available modalities and to develop new techniques for the evaluation of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in conjunction with spin-echo imaging in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> of the anterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging and three-dimensional Fourier transformed time-of-flight MRA studies, performed on 50 patients within one week after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, were retrospectively reviewed and correlated with clinical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five of the 50 MRAs were considered nondiagnostic and excluded because of poor patient cooperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 41 of the 45 cases, the area of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> corresponding to the clinical deficit at the time of study was identified on T2-weighted spin-echo images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>Arterial occlusions</z:mp> or severe stenoses that corresponded to ischemic manifestations were identified with MRA in 37 of the 45 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A focal discontinuity with decreased arterial caliber corresponded to stenosis and nonvisualization of distal branches represented <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MRA provided information for 23 cases not obtained from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vascular lesions demonstrated on intracranial MRA show a high correlation with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MRA, which provides information adjunctive to conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging in a majority of cases, is concluded to be an important component of the complete evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
