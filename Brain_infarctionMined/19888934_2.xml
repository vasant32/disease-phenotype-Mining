<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we hypothesized that partial intra-aortic occlusion of the abdominal aorta would increase salvage of ischemic penumbra and reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after focal embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of aortic occlusion on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, expression and activation of matrix metalloprotease-9, and hemorrhagic transformation with or without treatment with tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then examined the effects of aortic occlusion on perfusion deficits following embolic occlusion </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present study shows that partial intra-aortic occlusion significantly decreases infarction volume and perfusion deficits following ischemic injury in an embolic model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, combination treatment with tPA and partial intra-aortic occlusion further reduces infarction volume without any increase in hemorrhagic transformation </plain></SENT>
