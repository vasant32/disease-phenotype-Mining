<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, we have identified a series of neonates with unilateral temporal lobe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, suspected to be secondary to superficial cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, who have had relatively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Medical records were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>History, relevant studies, and outcomes for 7 patients are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most patients presented with neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging showed unilateral temporal lobe <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and surrounding ischemic change, which was initially attributed to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the vein of Labbe; however, magnetic resonance venogram findings suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of other superficial temporal lobe veins may also be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizure</z:hpo> control was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Development and neurologic examination at follow-up were usually <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that neonatal temporal lobe hemorrhagic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> secondary to suspected superficial temporal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> appears to have a good clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is surprising, given the dramatic imaging and clinical presentations </plain></SENT>
