<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the monkeys showed deficits in several neurological functions, including motor functions, but most of the deficits resolved within 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Very interestingly, the fractional anisotropy (a value determined by diffusion tensor MRI), of the monkeys' affected motor pathways dropped transiently, indicating a damage in the neural tracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, it returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels within 6 weeks after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, concomitant with the gradual recovery of motor functions at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
