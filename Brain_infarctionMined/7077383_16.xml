<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To estimate the risk of ischemic damages, the authors investigated the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in rats by means of autoradiography with <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-iodoantipyrine at different brain retractor pressures (BRP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A reduction in rCBF to between 10 and 75 ml/100 gm/min with 20 mm Hg of BRP for 30 minutes was found in brain cortex lying under the retractor (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 55 to 150 ml/100 gm/ min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With a BRP of 30 mm Hg for 30 minutes, rCBF was reduced to between 0 and 40 ml/100 gm/min, and with a BRP of 40 mm Hg for 15 minutes rCBF was 0 to 15 ml/100 gm/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rCBF in the basal ganglia remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Even with a BRP of 20 mm Hg for 30 minutes, there seemed to be a risk of focal ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
