<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of dilated Virchow-Robin spaces (dVRS) remains unclear and their impact on cognitive performances has only been reported in small sample studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to assess the association between severity of dVRS and risk of incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in an elderly cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The degree of dVRS in both white matter and basal ganglia were ranked using high-resolution 3D MRI in a population-based sample of 1,778 non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> participants from 65 to 80 years of age, who had a cerebral MRI at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cognitive function was assessed and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was diagnosed during a 4-year follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the association between dVRS degree on a four-level severity score and incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relationship between dVRS degree and change in cognition was examined using linear mixed effect models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During 6,135 person-years of follow-up, 27 individuals developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The highest degree of dVRS was associated with a strong increase in the risk of incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> independently of other standard risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, both for dVRS in white matter (HR=9.8, 95% CI 1.7-55.3) and in basal ganglia (HR =5.8, 95% CI 1.2-28.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After further adjustment on white matter hyperintensity volume and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, this association remained significant for dVRS in white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Higher rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> was found to be related to high degree of dVRS in basal ganglia but not in white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results need confirmation but they suggest that assessment of the severity of dVRS may help identify groups of individuals that are at increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
