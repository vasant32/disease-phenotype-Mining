<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">Uric acid</z:chebi> has been known to exert neuroprotective effects by acting as a free radical scavenger; however, several observational studies indicated that high levels of serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> increased the risk of cardiovascular events or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether increased levels of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> are associated with the presence of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (SBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recruited a consecutive series of non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> individuals who visited the Healthcare System in our hospital and underwent brain MRI (n=1577) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conducted intensive interviews and laboratory examinations, including serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined associations between SBI and vascular risk factors including <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> by controlling possible confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 1577 subjects recruited, 921 were men and 656 were women, and the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> level was much higher in the men (6.3±1.3) than in the women (4.7±1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a strong dose-response relationship between the quartiles of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> and the presence of SBI in women (p=0.001), but not in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis showed that the highest quartile of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> level was an independent risk factor for the presence of SBI in total patients (adjusted OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.11-2.91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, this association remained significant in women (adjusted OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.17-5.91), but not in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that an increased level of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> may be a risk factor for the presence of SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> level might be a good serum marker of underlying SBI or future <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, especially in women </plain></SENT>
