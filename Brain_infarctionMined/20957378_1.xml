<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Characteristic arteriolar changes were associated with subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and status cribrosus in basal ganglia and the cortico-subcortical junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>Leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> was very mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Severe arteriolar changes in the cerebral cortex and leptomeninges were associated with numerous intracortical microinfarcts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was abundant Abeta deposition throughout the cerebral cortex, mainly as A��42 diffuse plaques, frequently periarteriolar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> apart from rare Aβ40 deposits around Notch3-positive deposits </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Aβ accumulation could result from abnormal Aβ synthesis or impaired elimination due to the arteriolar changes of CADASIL </plain></SENT>
