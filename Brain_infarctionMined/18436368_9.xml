<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used 16 Wistar rats and the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion model for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">Glutamate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> levels were measured by intracerebral microdialysis before and after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induction and after US+MB application (n = 8) for 20 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 24 h, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.05) in the US+MB-treated group compared with control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In additional, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> levels were significantly lower in US+MB-treated animals, and these animals showed a higher rate of apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the infarcted area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha concentrations were not different in both groups, and there was no apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> outside the infarction in animals treated with US+MB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate that US+MB with second generation microbubbles does not have a harmful effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in an <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion model of the rat </plain></SENT>
