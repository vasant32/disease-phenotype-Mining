<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the hypothesis that the insertion/deletion (4G/5G) polymorphism of the plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 gene affects the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, since results concerning this association have been controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore performed a meta-analysis of published data regarding this issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive electronic search was carried out until January 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analysis was performed using random-effects models and meta-regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighteen eligible studies were retrieved (15 case-control studies and three cohort studies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The case-control studies included 3104 cases and 4870 control individuals concerning the contrast of 4G/4G versus remaining genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 4G pooled allele frequencies in cases and controls were 54.21 and 54.75%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, the per-allele odds ratio of the 4G allele was 0.98 (95% confidence interval, 0.858-1.121) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regarding genotypes, we derived nonsignificant odds ratios in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> contrasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The subanalysis including the three studies with a prospective design in the 4G/4G versus 5G/5G contrast derived a significant result (relative risk, 0.523; 95% confidence interval, 0.353-0.775), but the estimated effect size was insignificant when cohort and case-control studies were analyzed together (relative risk, 0.848; 95% confidence interval, 0.662-1.087) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We failed to demonstrate a significant association between the 4G/5G polymorphism and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> under basal conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Determination of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 function seems of much higher clinical value than determination of the 4G/5G polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The effect of this genotype on risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stressful diseases and the role of cohort studies in genetic epidemiology, however, warrant further investigation </plain></SENT>
