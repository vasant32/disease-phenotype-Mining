<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">Ethanol</z:chebi> caused a transient decrease in threshold concentration of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> to produce irreversible aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over a wide range of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> total platelet aggregation was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the presence of irreversible aggregation, formation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">thromboxane B2</z:chebi> rose from 303 +/- 56 to 950 +/- 212 fmol per 10(7) platelets (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects lasted as long as <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> was present in blood, did not significantly correlate to blood <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> levels and exhibited great individual variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It remains to be proved, whether these observations could contribute to the increased risk of ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> ingestion </plain></SENT>
