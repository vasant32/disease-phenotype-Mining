<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an association between plasma concentration of total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (tHcy) and pulsatility indexes (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53232">PIs</z:chebi>) of cerebral arteries in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (LI), comparing control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients referred to a neurovascular ultrasound laboratory were evaluated from March 2007 to February 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LI was determined by high signal intensity lesion (&lt;15mm) in brain MRI and PI was defined as (peak-systolic velocity-end-diastolic velocity)/mean flow velocity as recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma tHcy was categorized into tertiles and analyzed for an association with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53232">PIs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 83 patients with LI and 135 control subjects were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients with LI showed significantly lower peak-systolic, end-diastolic, and mean flow velocities than the control group, especially in posterior circulatory beds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The group with LI showed independent associations between the higher tertiles of tHcy and the graded and linear increases of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53232">PIs</z:chebi>, even after adjusted for potential confounders including vascular risk factors, but not in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interaction terms were significant in both the right middle cerebral artery and basilar artery, and borderline significant in the left vertebral artery (p=0.040, 0.022, 0.055, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Increased plasma tHcy was significantly and independently associated with increased cerebral arterial resistance in the patients with LI </plain></SENT>
