<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Protective mechanisms to attenuate damage are also set in motion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22610">Arachidonoyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> (2-AG) is an endogenous cannabinoid, identified both in the periphery and in the brain, but its physiological roles have been only partially clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we show that, after injury to the mouse brain, 2-AG may have a neuroprotective role in which the cannabinoid system is involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After closed head injury (CHI) in mice, the level of endogenous 2-AG was significantly elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We administered synthetic 2-AG to mice after CHI and found significant reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedema</z:hpo>, better clinical recovery, reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and reduced hippocampal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When 2-AG was administered together with additional inactive 2-acyl-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerols</z:chebi> that are normally present in the brain, functional recovery was significantly enhanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effect of 2-AG was dose-dependently attenuated by SR-141761A, an <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor </plain></SENT>
