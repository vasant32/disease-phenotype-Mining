<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Metabolic disruption was assessed using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49134">18F-fluorodeoxyglucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median initial serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration was 155 mg/dl (6.7 mM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical recovery was significantly poorer in patients with initial serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels higher than the median (p less than 0.05, chi square) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The severity of hypometabolism in the ischemic region, expressed as the percent asymmetry of local cerebral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism between homologous brain regions, was greater in patients with initial glycemia concentrations higher than the median (p less than 0.001, t test) </plain></SENT>
