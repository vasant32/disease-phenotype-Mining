<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 2003 and December 2006, a total of 419 patients with 529 unruptured intracranial saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were observed without treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up duration was 905.3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysm</z:hpo> size was measured by 3-dimensional CT angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and 3-dimensional CT angiography follow-up were obtained every 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> ruptured during observation resulting in a 1.4% rupture rate per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (hazard ratio, 7.3; 95% CI, 2.5 to 21.2), posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (hazard ratio, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.1 to 8), and large size were significant independent predictors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Size, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were significant risk factors for prediction of rupture of unruptured intracranial saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
