<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical data of 139 patients with a first episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> who underwent both TTE and TEE were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups, lacunar (LACI=36), and nonlacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (NLACI=103); then the latter group was divided into two subgroups, anterior (ACI=76) and posterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (POCI=27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were not significantly different between LACI and NLACI groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rate of potential cardioembolic risk factors detected by echocardiography was similar in the NLACI groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At least one potential cardiac source of embolism was identified in 44% (n=16) of LACI, 52.6% (n=40) of ACI and 55.5% (n=15) of POCI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was significantly frequent in the ACI group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups regarding age, sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, and smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> are equally important in the pathogenesis of both LACI and NLACI groups and there is a need for careful cardiac evaluation in cases even with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
