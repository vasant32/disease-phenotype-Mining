<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Enhanced release of proinflammatory cytokines may contribute to the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was examined whether G to A promoter polymorphism in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha gene at position -308 affects the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped 336 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and 333 healthy controls for this polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into different groups based on the Oxfordshire Community <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Project (OCSP) or a modified TOAST classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Distribution of the alleles at -308 G&gt;A promoter polymorphism was determined by PCR-RLFP method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> had a significantly (p&lt;0.001) decreased (0.115) frequency of the -308 A (TNF2) allele compared to the healthy controls (0.196) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When patients were categorized according to the OCSP classification, it turned out that significant (p=0.002) decrease in TNF2 allele frequency (0.065) was restricted to the patients with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (LACI) whereas the frequency of the TNF2 alleles in patients with the other three subtypes (TACI, PACI, and POCI) did not significantly differ from that in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained when the patients were divided according to the modified TOAST classification: the frequencies of the TNF2 allele were 0.068 and 0.140 (p=0.010) in the patients with small-vessel and non-small vessel (large vessel infarction or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> of other origin) infarction, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The age-adjusted odds ratio of the patients carrying the TNF2 allele to develop lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was 0.33 (0.16-0.68) (p=0.002) compared to the non-carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This difference was also restricted to the male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that male carriers of TNF2 allele are less susceptible for the development of lacunar subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> than the non-carriers </plain></SENT>
