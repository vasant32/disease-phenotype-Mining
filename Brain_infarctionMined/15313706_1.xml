<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The lateral tentorial sinus (LTS) has not been well described in the imaging literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the value of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging in assessing the LTS, which may provide guidance for preoperative planning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-five adult patients underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four neuroradiologists evaluated the studies for delineation of the LTS and its branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Presence of arachnoid granulation and dominance of the venous drainage also were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An LTS was detected in 104 of 110 lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The LTS in each lobe was classified as type I (candelabra) in 30 (28.8%), type II (independent veins) in 22 (21.1%), and type III (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">venous lakes</z:e>) in 37 (35.5%); in 15 (14.4%) of the lobes, the LTS was indeterminate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LTS branches were inconsistently detected, with the exception of the vein of Labb√© (VL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five of eight branches were seen in approximately half of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The VL was identified in 94 (85.4%) lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among these, 53 (56.4%) were draining into the LTS and 22 (23.4%) into the transverse sinus; in 19 (20.2%) cases, the terminal portion was not visualized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The right transverse sinus was dominant in 19 (34.5%) patients and the left in 18 (32.7%); codomination was present in 18 (32.7%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At least one arachnoid granulation was seen in the transverse sinus in 27 (49.1%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In many instances, the LTS and VL drainage patterns were well delineated on routine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>For selected cases, this information may be crucial during lateral skull base surgery to avoid venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
