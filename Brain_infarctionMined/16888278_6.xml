<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Few and conflicting data exist on the case fatality rate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with basilar artery dolichoectasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed basilar artery characteristics (diameter, height of bifurcation, transverse position) and 5-year mortality (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause, nonstroke vascular, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The basilar artery diameter was measured with a 16-diopter lens in 466 consecutively recruited patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The height of the bifurcation and the transverse position of the basilar artery were assessed on semiquantitative scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up for a median of 5.3 years (range, 1.5 to 6.6) and were classified as having had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, nonstroke vascular, and nonvascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> according to the French national registry of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 157 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, 88 were vascular (including 54 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery diameter was associated with an increased 5-year <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mortality rate but not with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause or nonstroke vascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mortality per 1-mm increase in basilar artery diameter was 1.23 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07 to 1.41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was associated with basilar artery diameter at the 95th percentile (diameter &gt;4.3 mm; adjusted HR 3.69; 95% CI, 1.63 to 8.38) and the height of bifurcation (adjusted HR for score &gt;1, 2.08; 95% CI, 0.93 to 4.68) but not with transverse position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Basilar artery diameter was independently associated with cerebrovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A diameter &gt;4.3 mm may be a marker for a high risk of fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
