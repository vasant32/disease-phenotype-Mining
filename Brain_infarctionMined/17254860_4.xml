<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The protective effect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> by systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> is limited by the cooling rate and it has severe complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate the effect of SBH induced by epidural cooling on infarction volume in a swine model of PMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was performed in 12 domestic swine assigned to groups A and B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In group A, the cranial and rectal temperatures were maintained at <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range (37 degrees C-39 degrees C) for 6 hours after PMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In group B, cranial temperature was reduced to moderate (deep brain, &lt;30 degrees C) and deep (brain surface, &lt;20 degrees C) temperature and maintained at that level for 5 hours after 1 hour after PMCAO, by the epidural cooling method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were euthanized 6 hours after MCAO; their brains were sectioned and stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> and their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The moderate and deep brain temperature (at deep brain and brain surface) can be induced by rapid epidural cooling, whereas the rectal temperature was maintained within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The infarction volume after PMCAO was significantly reduced by epidural cooling compared with controls (13.73% +/- 1.82% vs 5.62% +/- 2.57%, P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study has demonstrated, with histologic confirmation, that epidural cooling may be a useful strategy for reducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
