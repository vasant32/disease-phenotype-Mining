<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined patients with LA and symptomatic internal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients in the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial were evaluated for the extent of LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Long-term prognosis and perioperative risk associated with carotid endarterectomy were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 2618 patients, 493 had LA: 354 restricted and 139 widespread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with LA were older, had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, had more hemispheric ischemic events (particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>), and had small, deep brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 3-year risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> for medically treated patients were 20.2% (no LA), 27.3% (restricted LA), and 37.2% (widespread LA) (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For surgically treated patients, the risks were 14.2%, 25.4%, and 33.6%, respectively (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With widespread LA, occurrence of disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> doubled in medical patients and tripled in surgical patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 30-day perioperative risks of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> for surgical patients with 50% to 99% internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> were 5.3% (no LA), 10.6% (restricted LA), and 13.9% (widespread LA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite higher perioperative risk, endarterectomy reduced the absolute 3-year risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> ipsilateral to the symptomatic 50% to 99% stenosed artery by 11.6% (P=0.46) for patients with widespread LA, 7.6% (P=0.39) with those with restricted LA, and 10.9% (P&lt;0.001) for those with no LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or nondisabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> associated with internal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e>, presence of LA was associated with an increased risk of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and of disabling or fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with widespread LA had the worst prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Despite the higher perioperative risk, endarterectomy reduced the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
