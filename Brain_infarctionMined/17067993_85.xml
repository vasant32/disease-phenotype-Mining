<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Progressive ischaemic damage in animals is associated with spreading mass depolarizations of neurons and astrocytes, detected as spreading negative slow voltage variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Speculation on whether spreading depolarizations occur in human ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has continued for the past 60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we performed a prospective multicentre study assessing incidence and timing of spreading depolarizations and delayed ischaemic neurological deficit (DIND) in patients with major <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) requiring <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spreading depolarizations were recorded by electrocorticography with a subdural electrode strip placed on cerebral cortex for up to 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 2110 h recording time was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical state was monitored every 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Delayed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> after SAH were verified by serial CT scans and/or MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Electrocorticography revealed 298 spreading depolarizations in 13 of the 18 patients (72%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A clinical DIND was observed in seven patients 7.8 days (7.3, 8.2) after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DIND was time-locked to a sequence of recurrent spreading depolarizations in every single case (positive and negative predictive values: 86 and 100%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In four patients delayed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> developed in the recording area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As in the ischaemic penumbra of animals, delayed infarction was preceded by progressive prolongation of the electrocorticographic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> periods associated with spreading depolarizations to &gt;60 min in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that spreading depolarizations have a high incidence in major SAH and occur in ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Repeated spreading depolarizations with prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> periods are an early indicator of delayed ischaemic brain damage after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In view of experimental evidence and the present clinical results, we suggest that spreading depolarizations with prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depressions</z:hpo> are a promising target for treatment development in SAH and ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
