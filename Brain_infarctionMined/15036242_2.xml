<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven age-matched women comprised a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Basic and multivariate analysis disclosed different patterns of IL-6 increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the MI group IL-6 was significantly elevated independently of factors known to increase IL-6 levels; the increase was most pronounced in patients with high <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This result suggests a prothrombotic association of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) with IL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the whole LACI group IL-6 was not significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, patients with elevated levels of IL-6 had abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and elevated fibrinogen, suggesting the possibility that this combination might represent a specific risk profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In VT group elevated IL-6 level was found in the group of previous users of oral contraceptives (OC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This might be relevant, since it is known that OC could importantly increase (previously elevated) IL-6 level in selected women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest the hypothesis that the role of IL-6 might be vascular-bed-specific and further propose that increased IL-6 level might represent a novel, non-classical risk factor for development of MI, LACI and VT in specific subgroups of young women, which have to be clarified in further studies </plain></SENT>
