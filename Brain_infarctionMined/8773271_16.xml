<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He was asked to detect and localise an area of parenchymal low density and/or focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A follow-up study showing the definite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> served as a reference in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 38 patients areas of slightly low density were seen, and in 36 follow-up CT confirmed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the locations indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients the reading was false positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 6 patients no low density focus could be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these 8 patients examined by CT within 180 min of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, no low density could be identified, even in retrospect with the knowledge of the findings on follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, 42 readings (95%) were true positive or true negative; 2 were false positive; and none was a false negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CT within 6 h of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms has a mean sensitivity of 82% (36/44) for ischaemic cerebral hemisphere <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By contrast, its sensitivity to ischaemic parenchymal low density is low during the initial 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The early development of hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> can be detected reliably if the radiologist is familiar with the signs </plain></SENT>
