<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To study the reliability of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume assessment with ruler and calculator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> of 45 patients were measured using 3 different methods on CT scans: In each section showing the lesion, the largest diameters were measured and multiplied by the slice thickness using the formula for A) an ellipsoid and B) a cylinder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sectional volumes were summed up to calculate the entire lesion volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>C) Using the ellipsoid formula, the thickness of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sections showing the lesion were added and used as the third diameter which was multiplied with the two largest diameters of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lesion volume was also assessed by planimetry on a workstation and served as reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using method A, two independent investigators measured 93 brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of 49 patients to assess the 95% confidence interval (CI) of agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to the reference, method A underestimated the volumes by -25%, method B overestimated the volumes by +12.5%, and method C by +18.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean difference between the two investigators was 2 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 95% CI for small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> &lt; or = 50 ml was 60%-150%, for larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> +/- 26 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This simple method is only reliable when changes in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume exceeding 26 ml are to be detected </plain></SENT>
