<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The enrolled population in this study consisted of 314 healthy subjects and 274 patients with myocardial or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GPVI T13254C genotypes were determined by PCR amplification of a 355 bp fragment encompassing exon 5 of GPVI gene, followed by Msp I digestion of the product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The digested products were analyzed in 15% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis (PAGE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequencies of the T allele and C allele in the T13254C polymorphism were 0.9809 and 0.0191, respectively, with a frequency of heterozygous of 0.0319, which were significantly different from those reported in western population (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As compared with controls, no significant difference in T13254C genotype distribution was found in the arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic diseases</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The GPVI T13254C polymorphism appears in a low frequency in Chinese Han population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No relationship is found between T13254C polymorphism and the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
