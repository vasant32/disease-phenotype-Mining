<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cardiovascular complications reported to be associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35544">cyclooxygenase inhibitor</z:chebi> use have shifted our focus toward <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandins</z:chebi> and their respective receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">Prostaglandin</z:chebi> D(2) and its DP1 receptor have been implicated in various <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathologic conditions, but their role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is still poorly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we tested whether DP1 deletion aggravates N-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-D: -aspartic acid (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>)-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> toxicity and whether DP1 pharmacologic activation protects mice from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> excitotoxicity and transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, since the elderly are more vulnerable to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related damage than are younger patients, we tested the susceptibility of aged DP1 knockout (DP1(-/-)) mice to brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that intrastriatal injection of 15 nmol <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> caused significantly larger lesion volumes (27.2 +/- 6.4%) in young adult DP1(-/-) mice than in their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, intracerebroventricular pretreatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice with 10, 25, and 50 nmol of the DP1-selective <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> BW245C significantly attenuated the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-induced lesion size by 19.5 +/- 5.0%, 39.6 +/- 7.7%, and 28.9 +/- 7.0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lowest tested dose of BW245C also was able to reduce middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> size significantly (21.0 +/- 5.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the aggravated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-induced brain damage was persistent in older DP1(-/-) mice as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the DP1 receptor plays an important role in attenuating brain damage and that selective targeting of this receptor could be considered as an adjunct therapeutic tool to minimize <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> damage </plain></SENT>
