<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> mortality rates have declined in many countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> incidence rates have also declined, but not to the same extent and not always in parallel with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate trends in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence and long-term survival in a Swedish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A population-based survey of the incidence of first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was performed prospectively in the periods 1975 to 1977, 1983 to 1986, and 1987 to 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Case fatality ratios and survival rates were followed to 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Crude incidence rates increased between 1975 to 1977 and 1983 to 1986, but age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates were stable during the whole period of 1975 to 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> decreased by approximately two thirds, whereas the incidence of mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> almost doubled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The case fatality ratio at 28 days did not change, but the 10-year survival ratio increased from 13% to 35% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean survival time increased significantly among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> but not among patients with subarachnoidal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of undetermined origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> incidence and short-term case fatality did not change between 1975 and 1990 in the SÃ¶derhamn population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Long-term survival after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, on the other hand, has continued to improve to 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The implication of these changes is that the burden of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is likely to increase unless <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> are becoming less severe </plain></SENT>
