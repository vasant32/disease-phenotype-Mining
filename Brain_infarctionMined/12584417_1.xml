<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using magnetic resonance imaging, the frequency and the pattern of ischemic lesions between an HS group and an IS group were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-eight patients with HS and 104 patients with IS as a control group were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rate of grade 2 and 3 periventricular white matter lesions (WML) in the HS group was similar to that in the IS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, grade 2 and 3 lacunes (LAC) were more frequent in the HS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results show that the incidence of concomitant silent LAC is different from that of WML in HS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the pathophysiology of WML and that of LAC is different and that the pathophysiology of HS is closely associated with that of LAC </plain></SENT>
