<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed 65 consecutive patients with pure motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, sensorimotor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and ataxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EMW was defined as deterioration by ≥1 point on the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale for motor function within 5 days of admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EMW was observed in 22 patients (34%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HbA1c levels were higher in patients with EMW than in those without EMW (7.9 ± 2.6 vs. 6.3 ± 1.6%; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage of EMW patients with intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (ICAS) was greater than that of non-EMW patients with ICAS (13/22 patients, 59% vs. 8/43 patients, 19%; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that HbA1c levels ≥7.0% (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.5-6.8; p &lt; 0.005) or ICAS (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.8; p &lt; 0.05) increased the risk of EMW, and the combination of these factors increased the risk in an additive manner (OR 7.6, 95% CI 2.5-40; p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HbA1c levels ≥7.0% and/or ICAS in patients with penetrating artery infarction are associated with EMW </plain></SENT>
