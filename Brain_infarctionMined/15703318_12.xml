<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: It has been suggested that executive dysfunction could be the core defect in patients with geriatric or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and that this <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>-dysexecutive syndrome (DES) might be related to frontal-subcortical circuit dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors tested this hypothesis in 158 poststroke patients, of whom 21 had both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and executive dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: In this cross-sectional cohort study, a neurological, psychiatric, and neuropsychological examination was carried out 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, white-matter changes, and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> were recorded by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 21 patients with DES had significantly more brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> affecting their frontal-subcortical circuit structures than the 137 patients without DES, or the 41 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> but without executive dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with DES also had more severe depressive symptoms and worse psychosocial functioning, and they coped less well in complex activities of daily living </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DES is a valid concept and may define a subgroup of poststroke patients with frontal-subcortical pathology and with distinct prognosis and treatment options </plain></SENT>
