<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to determine whether different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> types, single <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (LI) and multiple LI (MLI) with or without white matter lesions (WML), have different RF profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty RF parameters were analysed in 201 consecutive patients with magnetic resonance imaging finding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: History of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, higher systolic and mean blood pressure (BP) but also <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, and higher plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels were more frequent in MLI compared to single LI patients (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with one LI were younger, more frequently had clinically evident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant difference between groups was found only in these RF, indicating that similar pathological processes led to both types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Positive correlation with age and family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> necessitates further analyses of other factors, predominantly genetic, as the key to the answer why patients develop different lesions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
