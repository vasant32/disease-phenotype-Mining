<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: 20-male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unilateral frontal strip craniectomy was done in front of the coronal suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Frontal veins were observed by using the operative microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study we used the bipolar coagulation method over the transparent dura mater for occlusion of the bridging veins for venous infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specimens were evaluated by histopathological techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Unilateral frontal hemispheric swelling, midline shift, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, subcortical petechial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, hemorrhagic infarction and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> were the histopathological findings on microscopic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that the bipolar coagulation method over the transparent dura mater for occlusion of the unilateral frontal cortical veins for venous infarction might be a new experimental model in the evaluation of brain damage after disturbance to the venous circulation </plain></SENT>
