<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The International Subarachnoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysm</z:hpo> Trial (ISAT) concluded that "there is currently no reason to doubt that the reduction of dependent survival or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after endovascular coiling seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in the ISAT cohort should not be valid in the elderly" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We feel that this generalization requires further investigation to assess its validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the impact of treatment era and independent risk factors for outcome in 179 consecutive elderly (&gt; or =70 years) aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (aSAH) patients admitted to Kuopio University Hospital either between 1983 and 1992 (Era I, n = 56), prior to the introduction of endovascular management, or between 1995 and 2004 (Era II, n = 123) when the endovascular treatment was established at our institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Altogether 150 patients underwent occlusive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> treatment, 47 clipping in the Era I as against 49 clipping, 49 endovascular therapy, and five combination therapy in the Era II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 12-month survival (n = 179) did not improve from the Era I to the Era II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportion of good outcome (GOS IV-V) after occlusive therapy (n = 150) was equal in the Era I and Era II (n = 27/47; 57% vs. n = 56/103; 54%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate logistic regression analysis, independent predictors of poor outcome were age, poor grade (Hunt&amp;Hess IV-V), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp>, but not the mode of occlusive therapy (microsurgical vs. endovascular) CONCLUSION: Clinical severity of the SAH was the most significant predictor of outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Integration of coil treatment in clinical practice has not improved the overall outcome of aSAH in the elderly at our institute </plain></SENT>
