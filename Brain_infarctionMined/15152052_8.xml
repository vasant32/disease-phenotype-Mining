<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the changes in cerebral fractional oxygen extraction (FOE) over the first 3 d after birth in 25 very-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low-birth-weight</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">preterm infants</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve infants had no major cerebral injury and 13 had acquired brain injury; cystic <z:hpo ids='HP_0006970'>periventricular leukomalacia</z:hpo> (PVL) was present in 4 and <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> (IVH) in 9, of whom 2 also had hemorrhagic parenchymal infarction (HPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> values (median, 5(th)-95(th) centiles) for cerebral FOE in very-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low-birth-weight</z:hpo> infants with no cerebral injury were 0.38 (0.23-0.53) on d 1, 0.31 (0.18-0.45) on d 2, and 0.28 (0.17-0.38) on d 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Infants who developed cystic PVL had no significant change in cerebral FOE during the first 3 d after birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, cerebral FOE fluctuated in infants with IVH over the 3 d of measurement, decreasing from d 1 to d 2 (p = 0.03) and increasing from d 2 to d 3 (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The highest cerebral FOE values were seen in the two infants with HPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The different patterns of change in cerebral FOE with HPI and cystic PVL provide additional evidence that the pathogenesis of these two conditions is different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because high cerebral FOE is likely to be a consequence of low cerebral oxygen delivery, probably because of low cerebral blood flow, our results indicate that fluctuations in cerebral blood flow may occur when there is IVH or HPI </plain></SENT>
