<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten of 37 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> following cardiac surgery had an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in one of the vascular border zones on CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Haemodynamical characteristics and clinical features did not differ between border zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and remaining <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conclude that compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> series brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> following cardiac surgery are more frequently located in one of the vascular border zone areas, but peri-operative haemodynamic compromise alone does not sufficiently explain this difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other possible mechanisms, such as showers of (micro-)emboli, should also be considered </plain></SENT>
