<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a preliminary study, dramatic effects of train duration on perception in a patient with right brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the mechanisms of train duration on perception of peripheral somatosensory stimuli are examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects included healthy adults and patients with right <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Train duration effects on perception were examined in relation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, handedness, age, elevated peripheral threshold via <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3215">bupivacaine</z:chebi>, and impaired attention via <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16794">scopolamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perceptual thresholds to electrical pulses on the hand decreased as train duration increased, but only over the first several hundred milliseconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to controls, right brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients showed much greater lowering of threshold in the affected hand as train duration was extended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3215">bupivacaine</z:chebi> elevated thresholds, but had little or no influence on train duration effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">Diazepam</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16794">scopolamine</z:chebi> had no effect on thresholds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thresholds were lower in the left than right hand of healthy dextral subjects, irrespective of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sinistral subjects had less left/right asymmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Increased train duration effect in patients is not explained by a primary elevation in threshold or by impaired vigilance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Lower perceptual thresholds in the left hand of healthy dextral subjects is consistent with right cerebral dominance for externally directed attention </plain></SENT>
