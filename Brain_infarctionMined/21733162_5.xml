<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) induces primary and secondary damage in both the endothelium and the brain parenchyma, collectively termed the neurovascular unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While neurons die quickly by <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, a vicious cycle of secondary injury in endothelial cells exacerbates the initial injury in the neurovascular unit following TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In activated endothelial cells, excessive <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> reacts with nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) to form <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">Peroxynitrite</z:chebi> has been implicated in blood brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) leakage, altered metabolic function, and neurobehavioral impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">S-nitrosoglutathione</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi>), a nitrosylation-based signaling molecule, was reported not only to reduce brain levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> and oxidative metabolites but also to improve neurological function in TBI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and spinal cord injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi> promotes the neurorepair process by reducing the levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> and the degree of oxidative injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: TBI was induced by controlled cortical impact (CCI) in adult male rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi> or 3-Morpholino-sydnonimine (SIN-1) (50 Î¼g/kg body weight) was administered orally two hours following CCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The same dose was repeated daily until endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi>-treated (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi> group) or SIN-1-treated (SIN-1 group) injured animals were compared with vehicle-treated injured animals (TBI group) and vehicle-treated sham-operated animals (Sham group) in terms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi>, NO, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH), <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, blood brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) leakage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, tissue structure, axon/myelin integrity, and neurotrophic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SIN-1 treatment of TBI increased whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi> treatment decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxides</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="5" ids="17478">aldehydes</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> leakage, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in a short-term treatment (4-48 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi> also reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> and enhanced the levels of NO and GSH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In a long-term treatment (14 days), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi> protected axonal integrity, maintained myelin levels, promoted synaptic plasticity, and enhanced the expression of neurotrophic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate the participation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> in the pathobiology of TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi> treatment of TBI not only reduces <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> but also protects the integrity of the neurovascular unit, indicating that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi> blunts the deleterious effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A long-term treatment of TBI with the same low dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi> promotes synaptic plasticity and enhances the expression of neurotrophic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These results support that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi> reduces the levels of oxidative metabolites, protects the neurovascular unit, and promotes neurorepair mechanisms in TBI </plain></SENT>
