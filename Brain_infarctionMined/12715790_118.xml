<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to verify its therapeutic efficacy following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients commencing within 72 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">Edaravone</z:chebi> was infused at a dose of 30 mg, twice a day, for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At discharge within 3 months or at 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, the functional outcome was evaluated using the modified Rankin Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and fifty-two patients were initially enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 125 were allocated to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> group and 125 to the placebo group for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients were excluded because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant improvement in functional outcome was observed in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> group as evaluated by the modified Rankin Scale (p = 0.0382) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">Edaravone</z:chebi> represents a neuroprotective agent which is potentially useful for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, since it can exert significant effects on functional outcome as compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
