<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The frequency and duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> events recorded some 3-12 weeks before the infants' <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brainstem material from these 38 infants was studied in an attempt to elucidate the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> and neuronal pathological changes in the arousal pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The histochemical analyses included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1389790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Bielschowsky</z:e> staining and the immunohistochemical analyses included the evaluation of growth-associated phosphoprotein 43 (GAP43) and of synaptophysin as markers for synaptic plasticity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurofibrae with positive pathological reactions were quantitatively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pathological and physiological data were linked for each infant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> and neuronal plasticity in the arousal pathway of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e> victims was not seen in the control infants and the correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> and neuronal plasticity in the arousal pathway found in the control infants was not seen in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e> victims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that neuronal plasticity in the brainstem arousal pathway is related with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
