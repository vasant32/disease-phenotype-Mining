<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated a reduction of oxidative neuronal cell damage with EPC-K1 by immunohistochemical analysis for 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in rat brain with 60 min transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, in association with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> in situ nick end labeling (TUNEL) and staining for total and active caspase-3 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no positive cells for 8-OHdG and TUNEL in sham-operated brain, but numerous cells became positive for 8-OHdG, TUNEL and caspase-3 in the brains with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These reductions were particularly evident in the border zone of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, but the degree of reduction was less in caspase-3 staining than in 8-OHdG and TUNEL stainings </plain></SENT>
