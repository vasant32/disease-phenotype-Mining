<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 46 patients (35 men, 11 women; age, 70.3+/-10.4 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> small non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Small non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> was diagnosed using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) as being &lt;15 mm in diameter and located in the cortex and centrum ovale in the middle cerebral artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into two groups; Group D (n=6) had neurological deterioration within 7 days after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, while Group N (n=40) did not have any neurological deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Group D, the interval from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to clinical deterioration was 3.3+/-1.5 days (range 2-6 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure on admission was higher in Group D than in Group N (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Group D, four of these five patients with follow-up DWI had new <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> small ischemic lesions in addition to the initial lesions, indicating recurrent attacks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurological deterioration occurred within 7 days after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in 13% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurological deterioration was frequently caused by recurrent infarction detected by DWI </plain></SENT>
