<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The MITICO study was designed to assess the prognostic value of markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in relation to the risk of recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Multi-centered prospective observational study, in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> not receiving anti-coagulation therapy and who were recruited within 1-3 months from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were obtained at baseline and follow- up for the determination of high-sensitive C reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, IL-10, ICAM-1, VCAM- 1, MMP-9 and cellular fibronectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four follow-up visits within the first year were to rule out recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 965 patients from 65 hospitals, 780 (aged 67.5+/-11.2 years, 33.6 % female) were valid for main analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One-hundred and three patients (13.2 %) had a new adverse vascular event and 116 patients (14.9 %) a vascular event or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (66.4 % <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 21.5 % coronary and 12.1 % peripheral) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Levels of IL-6 &gt; 5 pg/mL and VCAM-1 &gt; 1350 ng/mL (ROC curve analyses) were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> recurrence risk (OR: 28.7; 95 % CI: 14.2-58.0 vs. OR: 4.1; 95 % CI: 2.4-7.1, respectively) following adjustment for confounding variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Risk of adverse vascular event or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> were associated with IL-6 (OR: 21.2; 95 % CI: 11.6-38.7) and VCAM-1 (OR: 3.8; 95 % CI: 2.3-6.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Baseline values of IL-6 &gt; 5 pg/mL and VCAM-1 &gt; 1350 ng/mL increase 21-fold and 4-fold, respectively, the risk of new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> event or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> not receiving anti-coagulation treatment </plain></SENT>
