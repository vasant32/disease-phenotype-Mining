<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to examine eventual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, the incidence of cavity formation, and factors associated with cavitation in patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> ≤25 mm in diameter, in the distribution of a penetrating artery, who had a follow-up MRI or CT at least 1 month or longer from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were retrospectively included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured baseline lesion size on DWI and T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and follow-up lesion size on T2/FLAIR and CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up MRI and CT images were assessed for cavity formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Predictors for cavitation were assessed in a multivariate model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 75 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> and follow-up CT or MRI, done 20.2 ± 16.6 and 21.2 ± 17.4 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean baseline DWI size was 13.5 ± 5.7 and T2/FLAIR size was 13.1 ± 5.3 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up T2/FLAIR lesion size was 8.2 ± 3.4 mm and smaller than baseline DWI and T2/FLAIR (p = &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up whole lesion size on CT scan was 7.1 ± 4.1 and smaller than baseline DWI and T2/FLAIR (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cavitation occurred in 23/38 (61%) MRI and 50/70 (70%) CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We identified periventricular white matter lesions as a predictor of cavity formation by MRI and CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> DWI significantly overestimates final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A third of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> do not develop a cavity </plain></SENT>
