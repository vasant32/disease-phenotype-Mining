<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the mechanism of hyperbaric oxygen preconditioning (HBO-PC) in neonatal HI rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven-day-old rat pups were subjected to left common carotid artery ligation and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (8% oxygen at 37 degrees C) for 90 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HBO (100% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>, 2.5 atmospheres absolute for 2.5 h) were administered by placing pups in a chamber 24 h before HI insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain injury was assessed by the survival rate, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC), Nissl, TUNEL straining and caspase-3,caspase-9 activities after HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In HBO preconditioned animals, survival rate was increased, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> ratio was decreased, and the positive stained TUNEL cells were reduced, accompanied by the suppression of caspase-3 and -9 activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that a single HBO-PC appears to provide brain protection against HI insult via inhibition of neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pathways </plain></SENT>
