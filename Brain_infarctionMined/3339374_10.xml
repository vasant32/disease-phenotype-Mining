<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The hospital admission rates for patients with specific types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were examined for seasonal variation and correlation with meteorological factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A seasonal variation in admission rates was found for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo>, thrombo-embolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and ill-defined cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall this seasonality was more strongly associated with the computed chilling effect of the atmosphere than with changes in temperature, humidity or wind speed alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No seasonal variation was observed for admission rates of intracerebral haemorrhage, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">occlusion of precerebral arteries</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intracerebral haemorrhage admission rates exhibited a decrease with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This evidence suggests that seasonal variation in admission rates exists only for certain pathological types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and this is strongly associated with changes in the chilling effect of the atmosphere </plain></SENT>
