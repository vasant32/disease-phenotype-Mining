<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The long term outcome of head-injured patients depends not only on the primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> but also to a large extent on the secondary lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of many secondary lesions, and specially that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, is based on simultaneous monitoring of several intracranial and systemic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Continuous intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is currently considered indispensable in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with a severe head injury and intracranial lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the information provided by this technique is insufficient to diagnose some of the complex physiopathological processes that characterize traumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the use of methods to estimate cerebral blood flow such as transcranial Doppler and jugular oximetry to complement ICP monitoring is becoming increasingly widespread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, determining the effect of tissue lesions and therapeutic measures on cerebral metabolism currently requires direct access to the brain parenchyma at the bedside </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this review we focus on three methods of regional cerebral monitoring: oxygen tissue pressure (PtiO(2)) monitoring, microdialysis and near-infrared spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The bases of each method and reference values for the variables analyzed will be discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also make a series of recommendations on how results should be interpreted in light of current knowledge </plain></SENT>
