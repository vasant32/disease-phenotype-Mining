<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> overexpression of human soluble IL-1ra (hsIL-1ra) were studied in a mouse model of permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A transgenic mouse strain (Tg hsIL-1ra+/-) has been developed using the promoter for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) to limit the overexpression to the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the neurological scores, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation revealed no differences between Tg hsIL-1ra+/- and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> resulted in pronounced astrocyte proliferation and microglial activation, as well as induction of inflammatory markers in both Tg hsIL-1ra+/- and WT mice, with no major differences between the two genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, hsIL-1ra expression in astrocytes was reduced in infarcted areas as compared to non-ischemic regions and sham-operated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, transgenic overexpression of hsIL1-ra was not neuroprotective in this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model, possibly due to insufficient levels for protection against the extensive lesion, or an up-regulation of compensatory inflammatory signals due to the lifetime blockade of IL-1 receptors </plain></SENT>
