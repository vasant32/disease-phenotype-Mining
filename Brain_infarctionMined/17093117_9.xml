<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a model of complete umbilical cord occlusion for 25 min in 0.7 gestation fetal sheep, we examined the effects of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (fetal extradural temperature reduced from 39.5 +/- 0.2 degrees C to &lt;34 degrees C; mean +/- SD), from 90 min to 70 h after the end of the insult, on postocclusion epileptiform activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first 6 h after the end of occlusion, fetal electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was abnormal with a mixture of fast and slow epileptiform transients superimposed on a suppressed background; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> started a mean of 8 h after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a close correlation between numbers of these EEG transients and subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> in the striatum after 3 days recovery (r(2) = 0.65, P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>Hypothermia</z:hpo> was associated with a marked reduction in numbers of epileptiform transients in the first 6 h, reduced amplitude of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, and reduced striatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, neuroprotection with delayed, prolonged head cooling after a severe asphyxial insult in the preterm fetus was associated with potent, specific suppression of epileptiform transients in the early recovery phase but not of numbers of delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
