<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 77-year-old man presented with repeated episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002249'>melena</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He had a medical history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and cardiogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and took medications, i.e. an antiplatelet agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Laboratory data revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy revealed a yellowish smooth submucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, 50 mm in diameter, on the Bauhin valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lesion was soft and compressible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overlying mucosa was erosive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CT scan showed a uniform mass with very low density in the ascending colon, corresponding to the above-detected lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical diagnosis of colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0012032'>lipoma</z:hpo> was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using a 25 mm electrocautery snare (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), we transected the upper portion of the mass to unroof the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mucosa layer was thick and hard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fat tissue was observed extruding from the cut surface, consistent with the diagnostic hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After dissecting the overlying mucosa on the anal side by means of an IT knife (Olympus) in order to completely extrude the mass, the fat tissue was further exposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It took about 26 min to perform the whole procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no procedure-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Macroscopically, the resected lesion was a yellow <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e>, 1.6 × 1.5 × 0.7 cm in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Histopathologic examination of the excised specimen confirmed the diagnosis of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0012032'>lipoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The clinical course was uneventful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A follow-up endoscopy 1 month later showed a scarred mucosa at the resection site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Similarly, a follow-up CT scan 2 months later revealed no evidence of residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0012032'>lipoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The unroofing technique is safe, easy and suitable for the treatment of large <z:hpo ids='HP_0012032'>lipomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
