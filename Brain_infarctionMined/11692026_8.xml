<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Because of its precise connectivity and functional specificity, the rat whisker-barrel system offers an excellent opportunity to study experience-dependent neuroplasticity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, data are lacking regarding the neuroplasticity of this system after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to develop a reproducible model for the production of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion of the posteromedial barrel subfield (PMBSF) in the rat, which is the visible representation of the large whiskers on the opposite face </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focal cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=40) by slowly compressing the intact dura (maximum 0.05 mm/s) with a 4- or 5-mm-diameter brass cylinder equipped with a laser-Doppler probe, combined with ipsilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The microvascular blood flow of PMBSF during compression <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was maintained at 18% to 20% of baseline flow for 1 hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total infarction volume was measured by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining at several reperfusion times, and pathological examination was performed on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin-stained sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were 36.5+/-9.2 (n=9), 40.7+/-7.7 (n=7), and 36.6+/-6.4 mm(3) (n=5) at 24 hours, 72 hours, and 7 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, respectively, with no significant differences among these values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of damage to white matter or to deep gray matter and no evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The topographic distribution of the damaged tissue was in good agreement with that of PMBSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model produces a highly consistent cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in PMBSF and can facilitate the study of behavioral, functional, and structural consequences after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion in the rat somatosensory cortex </plain></SENT>
