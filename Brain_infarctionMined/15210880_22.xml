<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the usefulness of a mismatch between the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> clinical manifestations and the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesion in predicting early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred sixty-six patients with a hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> of &lt;12 hours' duration were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score and the volume of DWI lesion were measured on admission and at 72 +/- 12 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured on T2-weighted or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images at day 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deterioration</z:hpo> (END) was defined as an increase of &gt; or =4 points between the two NIHSS evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight patients received IV thrombolysis or abciximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical-DWI mismatch (CDM) was defined as NIHSS score of &gt; or =8 and ischemic volume on DWI of &lt; or =25 mL on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The adjusted influence of CDM on END, DWI lesion enlargement at 72 hours, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth at day 30 was evaluated by logistic regression analysis and generalized linear models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CDM was found in 87 patients (52.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with CDM had a higher risk of END than patients without CDM because NIHSS &lt; 8 (odds ratio [OR], 9.0; 95% CI,1.9 to 42) or DWI lesion &gt; 25 mL (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 0.8 to 4.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CDM was associated with an increase of 46 to 68 mL in the mean volume of DWI lesion enlargement and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth in comparison with non-CDM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the effects were even greater and significant in patients not treated with reperfusion therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with an NIHSS score of &gt; or =8 and DWI volume of &lt; or =25 mL have a higher probability of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth and early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deterioration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The new concept of CDM may identify patients with tissue at risk of infarction for thrombolytic or neuroprotective drugs </plain></SENT>
