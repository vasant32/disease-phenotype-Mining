<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is a need for a brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> model to allow studies of organ viability and preservation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For neurointensive care research, it is also of interest to have a relevant brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> model for studies of intracranial dynamics and evaluation of cerebral monitoring devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the objective was to develop a standardized clinically relevant brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six pigs of both sexes (10-12 wks old; mean weight, 24.5±1.4 kg) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, intracranial pressure, intracranial compliance, cerebral perfusion pressure, and brain tissue oxygenation (BtiPo2) were recorded during stepwise elevation of intracranial pressure by inflation of an epidural balloon catheter with saline (1 mL/20 mins) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> criteria were decided to be reached when cerebral perfusion pressure was &lt;0 mm Hg for 60 mins and at least 10 mL saline was inflated epidurally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BtiPo2 and arterial injections of microspheres were used for confirmation of brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A gradual volume-dependent elevation of intracranial pressure was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 10 mL of balloon infusion, mean intracranial pressure was 89.8±9.7 (sd) mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intracranial compliance decreased from 0.137±0.069 mL/mm Hg to 0.007±0.001 mL/mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean arterial pressure decreased and the heart rate increased when the intracranial volume was increased to between 5 and 6 mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals showed cerebral perfusion pressure≤0 after 7 to 10 mL of infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals, the criteria for brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> with negative cerebral perfusion pressure and BtiPo2 ∼0 mm Hg were achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Only a negligible amount of microspheres were found in the cerebrum, confirming brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The kidneys showed small foci of <z:hpo ids='HP_0008682'>acute tubular necrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The standardized brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> model designed in pigs simulates the clinical development of brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in humans with a classic pressure-volume response and systemic cardiovascular reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was convincingly confirmed </plain></SENT>
