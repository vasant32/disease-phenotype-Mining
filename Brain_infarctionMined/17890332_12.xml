<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 in cattle and other species with which humans have frequent contact is high, human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> are relatively uncommon, despite a low infectious dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A plausible explanation for the low disease incidence is the possibility that not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> strains are virulent in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If there are substantial differences in virulence among strains in nature, then human disease may select for high virulence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used a gnotobiotic piglet model to investigate the virulence of isolates from healthy cattle and from humans in disease outbreaks and to determine the correlation between production of Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1) and Stx2 and virulence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, E. coli O157:H7 strains isolated from healthy cattle were less virulent in gnotobiotic piglets than strains isolated from humans during disease outbreaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The amount of Stx2 produced by E. coli O157:H7 strains correlated with strain virulence as measured by a reduction in piglet survival and signs of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disease due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The amount of Stx1 produced in culture was not correlated with the length of time of piglet survival or with signs of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that disease outbreaks select for producers of high levels of Stx2 among E. coli O157:H7 strains shed by animals and further suggest that Stx1 expression is unlikely to be significant in human outbreaks </plain></SENT>
