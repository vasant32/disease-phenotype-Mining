<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The parameters of evoked bioelectrical activity (focal potentials) of the slices are registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The extent of <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> cells injury is established by comparing the focal potentials parameters in the control and during the blood application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The potential to cell recovery after the blood exposure is defined by comparing of these parameters in the control and after washing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The method permits to increase the model repeatability to 100% and reveals the cell and molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
