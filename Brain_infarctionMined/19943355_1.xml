<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Synchronous brain activity in motor cortex in perception or in complex cognitive processing has been the subject of several studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The advanced analysis of cerebral electro-physiological activity during the course of planning (PRE) or execution of movement (EXE) in a high temporal resolution could reveal interesting information about the brain functional organization in patients following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High-power (128 channels) electroencephalography registration was carried out on 8 healthy subjects and on a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with capsular lacuna in the right hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For activation of motor cortex, the finger tapping paradigm was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this preliminary study, we tested a theoretical graph approach to characterize the task-related spectral coherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the obtained brain functional networks were analyzed by the connectivity degree, the degree distribution, and efficiency parameters in the Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma bands during the PRE and EXE intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the brain networks were found to hold a regular and ordered topology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, significant differences (P &lt; 0.01) emerged between the patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the control subjects, independently of the neural processes related to the PRE or EXE periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the Beta (13-29 Hz) and Gamma (30-40 Hz) bands, the significant (P &lt; 0.01) decrease in global- and local-efficiency in the patient's networks, reflected a lower capacity to integrate communication between distant brain regions and a lower tendency to be modular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This weak organization is principally due to the significant (P &lt; 0.01 Bonferroni corrected) increase in disconnected nodes together with the significant increase in the links in some other crucial vertices </plain></SENT>
