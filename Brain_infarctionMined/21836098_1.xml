<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A survey was conducted of a total of 13 129 men and 22 528 women aged 40 to 69 years at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the median 12.0-year follow-up, there were 526 incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> (259 lacunar infarctions, 91 large-artery occlusive, and 140 embolic infarctions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> for both sexes was approximately 2 to 4 times higher for diabetic subjects than for those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant excess risks of lacunar and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264978" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic infarction</z:e> for both sexes and of large-artery occlusive infarctions for women were also observed in diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was not associated with risk of intraparenchymal or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> for either sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is a significant risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> for middle-aged Japanese </plain></SENT>
