<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to identify predictors for progressive neurological deficits using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 40 consecutive patients who were classified into two groups based on their NIHSS scores: progressive infarction (PI) and non-progressive infarction (NPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We calculated the size of DWI abnormalities and evaluated clinical characteristics on admission for both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 19 patients (47.5%) exhibited neurological deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to MRI was 8.2 ± 6.7 h for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DWI area was significantly larger in the PI relative to the NPI group (1.1 ± 0.5 cm(2) for PI vs. 0.7 ± 0.3 cm(2) for NPI; p = 0.002), although patients' NIHSS scores at admission were not significantly different between both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The optimal cut-off value of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area between PI and NPI was 0.98 cm(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area on DWI ≥0.98 cm(2) (odds ratio 10.57; 95% confidence interval 2.24-68.32; p = 0.006) was a significant independent predictor of PI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area on initial DWI was an independent predictor of neurological deterioration in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e> territory </plain></SENT>
