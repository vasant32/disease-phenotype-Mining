<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Central <z:mp ids='MP_0000768'>nervous system abnormalities</z:mp> have not been considered a feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022398" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HIES">hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine whether central <z:mp ids='MP_0000768'>nervous system abnormalities</z:mp> detected on brain MRI exist in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022398" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HIES">hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome</z:e> and to characterize any identified abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty patients aged from 3 to 52 years (mean: 24 years) with established diagnoses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022398" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HIES">hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome</z:e> had MRI of the brain as part of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022398" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HIES">hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome</z:e> natural history protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities were described, measured, counted, and mapped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient charts were reviewed for neurologic findings and blood pressure measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> exhibiting high signal intensities on flow-attenuated inversion recovery and on T2-weighted techniques were found in 35 of the 50 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The focal hyperintensities were predominantly in the white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, and the number ranged from 2 to &gt;50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The hyperintensities occurred more frequently in adults than in children, and no association with elevated blood pressure was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Chiari type 1 malformations were found in 9 of 50 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients had infectious complications presenting on MRI as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebritis</z:e> in 1 patient and as a hemorrhagic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the other; both were found on autopsy to be fungal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>Neurologic abnormalities</z:hpo> were present in 1 patient with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e>, the 2 patients with infectious complications, and in 1 patient with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> secondary to a berry <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Central <z:mp ids='MP_0000768'>nervous system abnormalities</z:mp> are common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022398" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HIES">hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Focal T2 hyperintensities, not appreciated previously, represent a prominent feature of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disease</z:e> that may assist in diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The etiology and clinical implications of these abnormalities remain to be investigated </plain></SENT>
