<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, correlations of CE-TCCS findings with clinical, angiographic, and CT results were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 90 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with inadequate insonation conditions in unenhanced transcranial color-coded real-time sonography (TCCS) examinations, CE-TCCS, clinical, angiographic, and CT examinations were performed within 12 hours, 36 hours (CE-TCCS only), and 1 week after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A CT angiography (CTA) as reference method was available in 39 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After application of a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi>-based echo-enhancing agent, the portion of conclusive ultrasound examinations of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, as manifested by an <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, decreased or increased flow velocity (FV), and symmetrical <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> FV, was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CE-TCCS findings on admission and during follow-up were correlated with infarction size as demonstrated on follow-up CT, and clinical findings were assessed by use of the European <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Adequate diagnosis was achieved in 74 of 90 patients (82%) by the use of echo contrast agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion or reduction of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> FV was found in 20 and 27 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion was confirmed by CTA in 17 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one individual, false-positive diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion was made according to ultrasound criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 5 patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, vessel recanalization was observed during follow-up; 15 of 27 patients with decreased flow velocities showed normalization after the third examination that was associated with a significantly better clinical outcome (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion or decreased FV in the first 12 hours were associated with significantly larger infarctions in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CE-TCCS findings (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CE-TCCS enables adequate diagnosis in approximately 80% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with insufficient unenhanced TCCS examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is a reliable diagnostic tool regarding <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> mainstem and branch occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Because this method conveys useful information concerning cerebral tissue and clinical prognosis, it may be useful to identify those patients who benefit most from local or intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
