<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the relationship between peak values of plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the first week after ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, with measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were prospectively recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma IL-6, and other markers of peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, were measured at pre-determined timepoints in the first week after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary analyses were the association between peak plasma IL-6 concentration with both modified Rankin score (mRS) at 3 months and computed tomography (CT) brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Peak plasma IL-6 concentration correlated significantly (p &lt; 0.001) with CT brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (r = 0.75) and mRS at 3 months (r = 0.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It correlated similarly with clinical outcome at 12 months or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Strong associations were also noted between either peak plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration or white blood cell (WBC) count, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that the magnitude of the peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> is related to the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
