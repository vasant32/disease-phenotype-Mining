<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this phase 2 trial, we aimed to assess whether the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-channel blocker lamotrigine is also neuroprotective in patients with secondary progressive multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with secondary progressive multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> who attended the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery or the Royal Free Hospital, London, UK, were eligible for inclusion in this double-blind, parallel-group trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly assigned via a website by minimisation to receive lamotrigine (target dose 400 mg/day) or placebo for 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treating physicians, evaluating physicians, and patients were masked to treatment allocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was the rate of change of partial (central) cerebral volume over 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who were randomly assigned were included in the primary analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00257855 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: 120 patients were randomly assigned to treatment (87 women and 33 men): 61 to lamotrigine and 59 to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>108 patients were analysed for the primary endpoint: 52 in the lamotrigine group and 56 in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean change in partial (central) cerebral volume per year was -3.18 mL (SD -1.25) in the lamotrigine group and -2.48 mL (-0.97) in the placebo group (difference -0.71 mL, 95% CI -2.56 to 1.15; p=0.40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, in an exploratory modelling analysis, lamotrigine treatment seemed to be associated with greater partial (central) cerebral volume loss than was placebo in the first year (p=0.04), and volume increased partially after treatment stopped (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Lamotrigine treatment reduced the deterioration of the timed 25-foot walk (p=0.02) but did not affect other secondary clinical outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rash</z:e> and dose-related deterioration of gait and balance were experienced more by patients in the lamotrigine group than the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: The effect of lamotrigine on cerebral volume of patients with secondary progressive multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> did not differ from that of placebo over 24 months, but lamotrigine seemed to cause early volume loss that reversed partially on discontinuation of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Future trials of neuroprotection in multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> should include investigation of complex early volume changes in different compartments of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>, effects unrelated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo>, and targeting of earlier and more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
