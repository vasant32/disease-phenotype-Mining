<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed in vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in a total of 33 patients with brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041295" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tuberculomas</z:e> (BT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of them had surgical excision of the lesion as it was clinically indicated, and in these samples matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression was quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We correlated the results of DTI indices like fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), linear anisotropy (CL), planar anisotropy (CP) and spherical anisotropy (CS) with MMP-9 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the remaining 20 patients had serial DTI studies while on specific anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculous</z:e> drug therapy and DTI indices in these patients were quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The FA, CL and CP significantly decreased while MD and CS significantly increased in BT compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The FA, CL and CP showed negative correlation with MMP-9 while CS correlated positively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In serial follow-up studies in 20 patients FA, CL and CP showed significant increase while CS decreased significantly over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that DTI indices show strong correlation with MMP-9 and these may be used as a surrogate marker of MMP-9 expression in BT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, these indices may be of value in assessing the therapeutic response in patients with BT who are treated only with specific anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculous</z:e> drugs </plain></SENT>
