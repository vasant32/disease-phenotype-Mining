<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have indicated that volume regulated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> channels (VRACs) may be involved in the pathology of the ischemic brain cortical penumbra due to activation of VRAC-mediated excitatory amino-acid (EAA) release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess this we had studied neuroprotection and EAA release inhibition by a potent VRAC inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> inhibits several other neurodamaging processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study we use an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4876">ethacrynic acid</z:chebi> derivative, 4-(2-butyl-6,7-dichloro-2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52880">cyclopentyl</z:chebi>-indan-1-on-5-yl) oxobutyric acid (DCPIB), that has recently been shown to be a specific <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of volume regulated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> channels (VRAC), to measure the extent of neuroprotection provided and thus to better assess the role of VRAC-mediated release of excitatory amino acids in an intraluminal suture, reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (rMCAO) model in adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats given DCPIB intracisternally had significantly better neurobehavioral scores after 24 h and showed significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were 208.0 (SD=38.3) mm3 for the vehicle groups, compared with 68.5 (SD=22.7) mm3 for intracisternally DCPIB-treated groups (p=0.02, Mann-Whitney test), a reduction of around 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, a 500-fold higher dose of DCPIB given intravenously did not reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume or improve behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The microdialysis study demonstrated statistically significant reduced brain extracellular fluid <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> when DCPIB was present in the probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus DCPIB, a specific inhibitor of VRACs, given i.c., provides strong neuroprotection in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, but it appears to not cross the blood brain barrier as it is not effective when given i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These experiments support the hypothesis that EAA released via VRACs contributes to later ischemic-induced damage </plain></SENT>
