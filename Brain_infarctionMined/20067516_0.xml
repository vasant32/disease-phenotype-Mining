<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Perforating artery territorial infarction (PAI) is usually a small artery disease (SAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it may also result from branch <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or arterial embolism from the proximal <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that patients with PAI caused by a SAD may have a distinct pattern of systemic artery involvement from those with PAI caused by large artery diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated retrospectively 329 consecutive patients with PAI who had angiographic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were grouped according to the presence or absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the parent artery or relevant artery: no arterial lesion (NAL), relevant artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (RAA) and parent artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relevant artery was defined as any artery which can cause index <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The parent artery was defined as an original artery that branches out and forms small artery which was responsible for index PAI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Systemic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and risk factors were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 329 patients with PAI, 109 had RAA, 45 had <z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi> and 175 had neither RAA nor <z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no differences amongst the groups in the classic risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in arterial beds other than the relevant artery to the infarction (other cerebral arteries, coronary arteries, descending aorta and peripheral arteries) was significantly lower in the NAL group (49.7%) than in either the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi> group (88.9%) or RAA group (93.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Perforating artery territorial infarction with RAA or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi> when compared to PAI without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> showed different involvement patterns of systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, suggesting potentially different aetiological mechanisms </plain></SENT>
