<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the pharmacological and toxicity profile of memantine in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> patients appears to be good, we determined whether memantine would be effective at improving behavioral performance following embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For these studies, we used a rabbit multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model with a well-defined behavioral endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, memantine dissolved in PBS was given intravenously either as a bolus injection (over 1 min) or infused over 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The P(50) of the control groups measured 24 h after embolization were 1.12 +/- 0.18 mg and 1.08 +/- 0.23 mg for the bolus injected and infused groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bolus injections of memantine at 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg were not effective at altering the P(50) value and memantine at a dose of 25 mg/kg was lethal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, slowly infused memantine (25 mg/kg) significantly increased the P(50) value to 2.31 +/- 0.48 mg and 3.13 +/- 1.13 mg when given 5 and 60 min following embolization, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Memantine administered 180 min following embolization also increased the P(50) value to 2.69 +/- 2.21 mg, but the response was variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that uncompetitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, more specifically open channel blockers, which may be alternatives to high affinity <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, may have substantial therapeutic benefit for the treatment of AIS and memantine or new dual activity analogs of memantine should be further pursued as a useful therapy to treat the behavioral deficits associated with multiple-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
