<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Computed tomography (CT) findings in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculous</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> (TBM) often do not explain the clinical presentation and may even be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential to diagnose TBM with greater sensitivity than CT and also to detect more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of this study was to determine whether MRI demonstrates features and complications of TBM not present on CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective, blinded evaluation and comparison of CT and MRI findings in children with TBM were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 30 children included, MRI demonstrated eight more with basal enhancement and four more with infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, MRI demonstrated an additional 104 sites of infarction (of a total 172) than CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 89 were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and visualized only on diffusion-weighted image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MRI showed five more patients with unilateral and two more with bilateral basal ganglia <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> than CT as well as 19 brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>Hydrocephalus</z:hpo> was equally detected by MRI and CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MRI is superior to CT for diagnosing TBM (by detecting basal enhancement in more patients) and prognosis (by detecting many more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in strategic locations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The role of CT is defined for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> setting in detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> for surgical management </plain></SENT>
