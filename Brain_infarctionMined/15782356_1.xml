<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to define the predictors of a good and poor prognosis after a CS secondary to an NVAF in our milieu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated the risk factors (RF) and severity of CS in relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, functionality and recurrence at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>81 patients between the ages of 49 and 88 were followed up consecutively for 1 to 90 months; 38 (46.9%) of them were males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis was performed with the following independent variables: age, gender, smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and characteristics of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The severity of the CS was assessed by means of the modified Rankin scale, which was dichotomised into a good prognosis (0-2) and a poor prognosis (&gt; or = 3), both basal and at the end of the clinical control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated the secondary preventive treatment used and its relation with recurrence, prognosis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No RF was linked to a poor prognosis or recurrence; 88% had a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Antiplatelet drugs were used in 42% of cases and 39% received <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A good final progression was observed in 9.5% of the patients treated with antiplatelet drugs versus 35% of those receiving anticoagulation therapy (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Severity of the CS on admission was worse in the aspirin group, with no differences in recurrence and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A better prognosis was observed in patients from urban areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Use of antiplatelet drugs, living in a rural area and a Rankin score of &gt; or = 3 on admission are factors suggesting a poor prognosis in the clinical control at 5 years </plain></SENT>
