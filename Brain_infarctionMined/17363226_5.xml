<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Stress is known to be one of the risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of the knowledge on the effects of stress on cerebrovascular disease in humans is restricted to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> effects on blood pressure and/or development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, few experimental studies have examined the possible mechanisms by which stress may affect <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have used an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stress protocol consisting of the exposure of male Fischer rats to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, single exposure immobilisation protocol (6 h) prior to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), and we have found that stress worsens behavioural and neurological outcomes and increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The possible regulatory role of the TNFalpha and IL-1beta was studied by looking at the release of these cytokines in brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of the present study showed an increase in IL-1beta release in cerebral cortex after exposure to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain levels of IL-1beta are also higher in previously stressed MCAO rats than in MCAO animals without stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological blockade of IL-1beta with an antibody anti-IL-1beta led to a decrease in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size as well as in neurological and behavioural deficits after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, our results indicate that IL-1beta, but not TNFalpha, accounts at least partly for the worsening of MCAO consequences in brain of rats exposed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stress </plain></SENT>
