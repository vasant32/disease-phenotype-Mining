<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Higher plasma total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (tHcy) levels have been associated with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, data regarding such associations are limited for Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined associations between tHcy levels and severity of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in Japanese subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, because <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> is the most prevalent type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in Japan, we also investigated its associations with tHcy levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects were 152 Japanese patients (age, 66.2+/-11.0 years) at our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using ultrasound, we evaluated severity of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> by plaque score, which is defined by the sum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> plaque (intima-media thickness &gt; or =1.1 mm) height in bilateral carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 112 of 152 patients, the existence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> was evaluated on brain MRI scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A moderate linear association was found between tHcy levels and plaque score (r=0.48, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, tHcy level was associated with plaque score (beta=0.26, P&lt;0.001) independently of traditional atherosclerotic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In logistic regression analyses, each 1-micromol/L-higher tHcy level was associated with a 1.37-fold-higher [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.19 to 1.58] likelihood for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e>, increasing the likelihood by 1.22-fold (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.43) independently of traditional atherosclerotic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Higher tHcy levels appear to have associations with increased severity of carotid atherosclerotic plaques and prevalent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> in the Japanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Larger prospective studies are necessary to establish whether higher tHcy levels serve as a harbinger for insidious carotid and cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
