<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their presence limits neuronal plasticity and may protect neurons against harmful agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we analyzed the relationship between spatiotemporal changes in PNN expression and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> markers after focal cortical photothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We registered a substantial decrease in PNN density using Wisteria floribunda agglutinin staining and CAT-315 and brevican immunoreactivity; the decrease occurred not only in the lesion core but also in the perilesional and remote cortex as well as in homotopic contralateral cortical regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluoro Jade C and TUNEL staining in perilesional and remote areas, however, showed a low density of dying cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the PNN reduction was not a result of cellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and could be considered an attempt to create conditions favorable for synaptic remodeling </plain></SENT>
