<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Internal coil trapping is a treatment method used to prevent rebleeding from a ruptured intracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> (VAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Postoperative medullary infarctions have been reported as a complication of this treatment strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between a postoperative medullary infarction and the clinical outcomes for patients with ruptured VADs treated with internal coil trapping during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study identified 38 patients who presented between 2006 and 2011 with ruptured VADs and underwent internal coil trapping during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The SAH was identified on CT scanning, and the diagnosis for VAD was rendered by cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Under general anesthesia, the dissection was packed with coils, beginning at the distal end and proceeding proximally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When VAD involved the origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) with a large cerebellar territory, an occipital artery (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>)-PICA anastomosis was created prior to internal coil trapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pre- and postoperative radiological findings, clinical course, and outcomes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The internal coil trapping was completed within 24 hours after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>-PICA anastomosis followed by internal coil trapping was performed in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postoperative rebleeding did not occur in any patient during a mean follow-up period of 16 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The postoperative MRI studies showed medullary infarctions in 18 patients (47%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean length of the trapped VAD for the infarction group (15.7 ± 6.0 mm) was significantly longer than that of the noninfarction group (11.5 ± 4.3 mm) (p = 0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Three of the 5 patients treated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>-PICA anastomosis had postoperative medullary infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcomes at 6 months were favorable (modified Rankin Scale Scores 0-2) for 23 patients (60.5%) and unfavorable (modified Rankin Scale Scores 3-6) for 15 patients (39.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Of the 18 patients with postoperative medullary infarctions, the outcomes were favorable for 6 patients (33.3%) and unfavorable for 12 patients (66.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A logistic regression analysis predicted the following independent risk factors for unfavorable outcomes: postoperative medullary infarctions (OR 21.287 [95% CI 2.622-498.242], p = 0.003); preoperative rebleeding episodes (OR 7.450 [95% CI 1.140-71.138], p = 0.036); and a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (OR 45.456 [95% CI 1.993-5287.595], p = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A postoperative medullary infarction was associated with unfavorable outcomes after internal coil trapping for ruptured VADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Coil occlusion of the long segment of the VA led to medullary infarction, and an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>-PICA bypass did not prevent medullary infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A VA-sparing procedure, such as flow diversion by stenting, is an alternative treatment in the future, if this approach is demonstrated to effectively prevent rebleeding </plain></SENT>
