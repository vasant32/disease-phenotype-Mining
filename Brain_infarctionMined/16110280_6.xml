<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Similar to a previous study on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0150088" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">hemineglect</z:e> patients, we recorded eye movements during a visual search task to investigate patients with isolated infarction of the cerebellum compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients showed longer search durations, associated with mild saccadic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001310'>dysmetria</z:hpo>, longer single fixation durations and a higher number of repeated fixations of items </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Systematic search strategies were preserved, but less frequent in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, though basic mechanisms of visual search including spatial memory were not affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar lesions</z:e>, patients' search behaviour was slower and less efficient, indicating a mild deficit of visual attention and motor planning </plain></SENT>
