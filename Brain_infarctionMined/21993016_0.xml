<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of present study was to investigate the neuroprotective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17431">agmatine</z:chebi> (AGM) on cerebral ischemic damage in diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Normoglycemic (n=30) and streptozocine-induced diabetic rats (n=82) were subjected to 30 minutes of suture-occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) with 24 or 72 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine diabetic rats were treated with AGM (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) immediately after 30 minutes of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the motor function, a modified neurological examination and rota-rod exercise were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> volume were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Caspase-3 activity and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end-labeling staining were used to evaluate cellular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis were performed to determine the expression of neuronal nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS) and inducible NOS in ischemic brain tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AGM posttreatment improved the neurobehavioral activity of diabetic MCAO rats at 24 and 72 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> volume were reduced in AGM-treated diabetic rats compared with those in diabetic rats without AGM posttreatment (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis showed that AGM treatment significantly decreased the number of caspase-3-positive and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end-labeling-positive cells in diabetic MCAO rats at 24 and 72 hours after reperfusion (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Western blotting and immunohistochemistry results indicated that AGM treatment significantly decreased neuronal NOS and inducible NOS expression in diabetic rats at 24 and 72 hours after reperfusion (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AGM posttreatment reduced cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and neurological deficit expression in diabetic rats subjected to MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was associated with a decrease in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and NOS expression </plain></SENT>
