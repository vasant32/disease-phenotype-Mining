<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two well established transient [transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO)] and permanent [permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO)] focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> models in the rat were used with drug treatments initiated up to 6 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to mimic the clinical scenario </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain penetration of Src inhibitors, their effect on blood-brain barrier integrity and VEGF signaling in human endothelial cells were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that both agents potently block VEGF-mediated signaling in human endothelial cells, penetrate rat brain upon systemic administration, and inhibit postischemic Src activation and vascular leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39112">SKI-606</z:chebi> or SKS-927 (at the doses of 3-30 mg/kg i.v.) resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and robust protection from neurological impairments even when the therapy was initiated up to 4- to 6-h after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Src blockade after pMCAO resulted in accelerated improvement in recovery from motor, sensory, and reflex deficits during a long-term (3 weeks) testing period poststroke </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that the novel Src kinase inhibitors provide effective treatment against ischemic conditions within a clinically relevant therapeutic window and may constitute a viable therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
