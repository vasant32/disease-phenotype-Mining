<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Preoperative cerebral imaging has been considered not to be cost-effective in carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Yet, silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (SBI) has been associated with the embolization potential of a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus the presence of SBI may represent an additional indication for CEA in asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the predictive value of preoperatively detected silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> on early and late outcomes in patients undergoing CEA for asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Preoperative cerebral tomographic (CT) scans performed on 301 asymptomatic patients undergoing 346 CEAs from 1986 to 1995 were reviewed by a single neuroradiologist blinded to patients' records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 67 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3 months (range, 24-130 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The degree of internal carotid lumen reduction was measured bilaterally in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (602 carotid arteries); <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> of 60% or more was found in 399 carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 103 (34%) CT scans positive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e>, 58% were lacunar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant association was observed between the side of the cerebral lesion on CT scan and the severity of the corresponding <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>; 38 silent lesions were detected in the 203 hemispheres ipsilateral to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e> that were less than 60% versus 95 SBIs in the 399 hemispheres ipsilateral to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e> that were 60% or more (19% vs 24%; P =.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate in patients with or without cerebral CT lesions (2% vs 1%; odds ratio, 1.94; P =.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mortality rate during follow-up was 22% in patients with preoperative SBI and 15% in patients without SBI (P =.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, actuarial survival at 10 years was shorter (P =.02) in patients with SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred in 11% of patients with preoperative SBI and in 3% of patients without preoperative SBI (P =.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analysis showed that both preoperative lacunar and nonlacunar infarctions were independent predictors of late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (hazard ratio, 3.6; P =.04; and hazard ratio, 7.1; P =.001; respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our experience, preoperative SBI did not occur more frequently in the hemisphere ipsilateral to asymptomatic severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Although our study lacks a medically treated control group, our data show that SBI is predictive of poor neurologic outcome in asymptomatic patients undergoing CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>We conclude that CT before CEA, selectively applied, provides information on long-term neurologic prognosis and that a less aggressive attitude towards CEA in asymptomatic patients with SBI may be justified </plain></SENT>
