<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: As they are "end arteries," microembolic obstruction of brain penetrating arteries would be expected to create <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Yet the mammalian brain appears to have an impressive tolerance to experimental microembolization with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> occurring only after the injection of large numbers of particulates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Potential explanations could be that the majority of these particulates marginate along the pial vasculature or escape the cerebral circulation via arteriovenous (AV) fistulae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To test these theories, we first established the level of injury created by the injection of 20, 45, and 90 μm fluorescent microspheres in Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brains were examined by immunohistochemistry for injury and for infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then injected 1000 size 20 μm, 500 size 45 μm, and 150 size 90 μm and harvested the brains and lungs for assays of fluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The location of microemboli within the brain was established by determining the percent of 20 and 45 μm fluorescent microspheres entering the superficial versus deeper layers of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The location of larger microemboli was established by 2T-MRI after injection of 60-100 μm microthrombi labeled with supraparamagnetic <z:chebi fb="27" ids="50820">iron oxide</z:chebi> (SPIO) particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With 20 μm microspheres there were no areas of injury or infarction after injection of 500 and rare areas of injury and no infarctions after injection of 1000 microspheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With either 250 or 500 size 45 μm microspheres there were a few (≤ 6) small areas of injury per animal with ≤ 2 areas of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After injection, 93%-96% of injected microspheres remained in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Approximately 40% of either fluorescent or SPIO labeled microthrombi were found on the brain surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: As in humans, the rat brain has an impressive tolerance to microemboli, although this clearly varies with emboli size and number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Wash out of particulates through AV connections is not a major factor in brain tolerance in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Approximately 40% of microemboli remain in the larger pial vasculature where the more extensive collateralization may limit their effects on distal perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, the remaining 60% enter penetrating arteries but few create <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
