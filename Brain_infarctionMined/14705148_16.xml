<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, reduced blood flow results in a cascade of pathophysiologic events, including <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, excitotoxicity, and platelet activation at the site of injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One serine protease that is associated closely with and produced in response to central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) injury is thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thrombin enters the injury cascade in brain either via a compromised blood-brain barrier or possibly from endogenous prothrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thrombin mediates its action through the protease-activated receptor family (PAR-1, -3, and -4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PARs belong to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors with a 7-transmembrane domain structure and are activated by proteolytic cleavage of their N-terminus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We showed that thrombin can be neuroprotective or deleterious when present at different concentrations before and during oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation, an in vitro model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We examined the change in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels of PAR-1 to 4 as a result of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in rat brain, induced by microinjection of endothelin near the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, after ischemic insult on the ipsilesional side, PAR-1 was found to be downregulated significantly, whereas PAR-2 mRNA levels decreased only moderately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PAR-3 was upregulated transiently and then downregulated, and PAR-4 mRNA levels showed the most striking (2.5-fold) increase 12 hr after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, in the injured side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the contralateral hemisphere, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was also affected, where decreased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were observed for PAR-1, -2, and -3, whereas PAR-4 levels were reduced only after 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data suggest involvement of the thrombin receptors PAR-1, PAR-3, and PAR-4 in the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
