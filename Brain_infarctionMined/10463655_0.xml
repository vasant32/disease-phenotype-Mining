<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 1/T1rho dispersion showed a fairly similar pattern in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The highest 1/T1rho relaxation rates were seen in liver and muscle followed by heart, whereas the values for spleen, kidney, and brain were quite similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared to 1/T2 relaxation rate, the greatest difference was seen in liver and muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rank order 1/T1rho value at each locking field B1 was the same as the transfer rate of magnetization from the water to the macromolecular pool (Rwm) for liver, muscle, heart, and brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The potential value T1rho imaging is to combine high T1 contrast of low field imaging with the high signal to noise ratio of high static field imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the T1rho value for a given tissue is known, the contrast between different tissues can be optimized by adjusting the locking time TL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies are encouraged to fully exploit this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Targets for more detailed research include brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, brain and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023903" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
