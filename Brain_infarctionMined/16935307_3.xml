<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Elevations in plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi>) have been associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying these associations remain poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study examines the relationships between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi>, cognition, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that: 1) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> levels are inversely related to cognition, 2) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> levels are unrelated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype, and 3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype affects cognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 169 consenting patients admitted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during a 4 month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood was drawn for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> levels and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was administered within 9 days of admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Oxfordshire Community <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Project Classification was used to characterize <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Correlation between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> and MMSE scores was examined as was the relationships between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype, and between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes and MMSE scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant inverse correlation between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> levels and MMSE scores was demonstrated (r=-0.243, p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MMSE scores also differed according to the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, with Total or Partial Anterior Circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> (TACI/PACI) scoring lowest (F=8.77, df=2, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> levels did not differ between the various <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes (F=0.21, df=2, p=0.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that age, education, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype, but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi>, were independent predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MMSE scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study sample, there was an inverse relationship between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> and cognition in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> was not an independent predictor for cognition in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after other factors such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype and patient age were taken into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype is a more important factor in determining cognition than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
