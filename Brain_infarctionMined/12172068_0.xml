<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the correlation between a clinical measure of function in patients undergoing rehabilitation who had recently had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and to examine cardiophysiologic measures registered during effort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A cohort study comprising a sample of consecutive patients, without a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> or rhythm disturbances, admitted for rehabilitation after an ischemic supratentorial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were examined for the FIM trade mark score and dynamic cardiophysiologic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results were analyzed in relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight patients participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had a superficial lesion, 20 had a deep brain lesion, and eight had no noticeable lesion by computed tomographic imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Function was measured with the FIM instrument 48-72 hr after admission and repeated at 1 wk before discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiographic activity was recorded during physiotherapy treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the RR and QT intervals in the electrocardiographic waveforms was found to estimate two cardiophysiologic variables, the constant (a) and the slope (b) values, reflecting the dynamic change of QT during physiotherapy effort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only for the subgroup of patients who sustained a deep brain lesion did the motor items in the FIM instrument on admission and discharge scores have a statistically significant relationship with the slope variable (b) and an inverse statistically significant relationship with the constant variable (a) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Deep <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> seems to result in a significant dysfunction of the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, manifesting itself as distorted dynamic behavior of the QT interval and with impaired functional performance </plain></SENT>
