<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the cerebral vasomotor response to ipsilesional repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on transcranial Doppler (TCD) in patients with recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> without carotid occlusive disease, and to compare this response in patients with cortical and subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with first-ever anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (&lt;3 days) and no extra- or intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> were prospectively recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into 2 groups: cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (CI, n = 15) and subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (SI, n = 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TCD cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) and pulsatility index were measured before and after 10-Hz suprathreshold rTMS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ANOVA showed a greater percentage increase in middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) CBFV in the SI group than in the CI group following rTMS (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage change in CBFV was significantly correlated between both <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> in SI patients but not in CI patients (r = 0.8, p &lt; 0.001 vs. r = 0.05, p = 0.9, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 10-Hz rTMS induces significant bilateral hemodynamic changes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, which appear to be less prominent and less synchronous in patients with cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings may allow optimization of the use of TMS in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
