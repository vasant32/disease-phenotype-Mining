<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A little is known about the proliferation and fate of neural stem cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, how endogenous neural stem cells are activated in the premature brain is not clear, although basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is important in neurogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the effect of bFGF on the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, we observed cellular changes in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of 3-day-old rats (approximately equivalent to premature infants) using immunofluorescence assays, Western blot analysis, and real-time quantitative PCR methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The bilateral common carotid artery (BCCA) was occluded in 108 animals, then half received bFGF 10ng/g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Besides, 54 rats without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proliferating cells were labeled by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) through intraperitoneal injection in a pulsed or a cumulative protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rats were killed at 4, 7, and 14 days after ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of proliferating cells in the SVZ in bFGF-treated rats was higher than that in untreated rats; bFGF also promoted neural stem cell differentiation into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis and real-time quantitative PCR assays confirmed these results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggest that bFGF promotes the repair of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> brain injury through increasing the proliferation of neural stem cells and their differentiation into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes </plain></SENT>
