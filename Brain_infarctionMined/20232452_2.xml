<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the experimental setup used in this study <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measurements could be done in one session without changing the setup or moving the subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The multinuclear measurement requires a total measurement time of 2 h and provides morphological (protons) and physiological (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52634">sodium-23</z:chebi>, chlorine-35) information in one scanning session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chlorine-35, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52634">sodium-23</z:chebi> and high resolution proton images were acquired from a phantom, a healthy rat and from a rat displaying a focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared to the healthy tissue a signal enhancement of a factor of 2.2 +/- 0.2 in the chlorine-35 and a factor of 2.9 +/- 0.6 in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52634">sodium-23</z:chebi> images is observed in the areas of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exemplary unlocalized measurement of the in vivo longitudinal and transversal relaxation time of chlorine-35 in a healthy rat showed multi-exponential behaviour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A biexponential fit revealed a fast and a slow relaxing component with T(1,a) = (1.7 +/- 0.4) ms, T(1,b) = (25.1 +/- 1.4) ms, amplitudes of A = 0.26 +/- 0.02, (1-A) = 0.74 +/- 0.02 and T(2,a) = (1.3 +/- 0.1) ms, T(2,b) = (11.8 +/- 1.1) ms, A = 0.64 +/- 0.02, (1-A) = 0.36 +/- 0.02 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combined proton, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52634">sodium-23</z:chebi> and chlorine-35 MRI may provide a new approach for non-invasive studies of ionic regulatory processes under physiological and pathological conditions in vivo </plain></SENT>
