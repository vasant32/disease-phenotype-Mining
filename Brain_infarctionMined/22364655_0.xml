<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the safety of emergency carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and unstable neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This prospective, single-center study involved patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in evolution (SIE) or fluctuating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or crescendo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (cTIA) related to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> ≥ 50% who underwent emergency surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preoperative workup included National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) neurological assessment on admission, immediately before surgery and at discharge, carotid duplex scan, brain contrast-enhanced head computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>End points were perioperative (30-day) neurological mortality, NIHSS score variation, and hemorrhagic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated according to clinical presentation (SIE or cTIA), timing of surgery, and presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> on neuroimaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between January 2005 and December 2009, 48 patients were submitted to emergency surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CEAs were performed from 1 to 24 hours from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms (mean, 10.16 ± 7.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients presented an SIE with a worsening NIHSS score between admission and surgery, and 22 presented ≥ 3 cTIAs with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> NIHSS score (= 0) immediately before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An ischemic brain lesion was detected in four patients with SIE and eight patients with cTIA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with cTIA presented a persistent NIHSS <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> score before and after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients with SIE presented an NIHSS score improvement after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean NIHSS score was 5.30 ± 2.81 before surgery and 0.54 ± 0.77 at discharge in the SIE group (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient with SIE had a hemorrhagic transformation of an undetected brain ischemic lesion after surgery, with progressive neurological deterioration and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Due to the absence of randomized controlled trials of CEA for neurologically unstable patients, data currently available do not support a policy of emergency CEA in those patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that a fast protocol, including CT scans and carotid duplex ultrasound scans in neurologically unstable patients, could help identify those that can be safely submitted to emergency CEA </plain></SENT>
