<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although it is known that prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is important in the development of HT, the role of reperfusion in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion induced HT is less well studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address the effect of reperfusion on HT, we assessed the incidence and severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in rats after 5 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by 19-hour reperfusion compared to rats with permanent occlusion (PMCAO) at the same 24-hour time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence and amount of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, neurological function, and mortality rates were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MCAO (5 h) with 19-hour reperfusion was associated with a significantly higher incidence of cortical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> compared to PMCAO (81.8% vs 18.2%, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Hemorrhage</z:mp> scores were higher in the 5-hour MCAO/reperfusion group compared to PMCAO rats (17.6+/-11.5 vs 2.4+/-5.3 in cortex, 20.4+/-4.6 vs 9.7+/-4.5 in striatum, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurological function was worse in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion group compared to PMCAO (p&lt;0.05) and mortality rates were insignificantly higher in the 5-hour MCAO/reperfusion group vs PMCAO group (54.5% vs 18.1%; p&lt;0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that reperfusion after prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is associated with increased hemorrhagic transformation and neurological deterioration as compared to permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whether pharmacological treatments prior to reperfusion attenuate post-ischemic HT requires further study </plain></SENT>
