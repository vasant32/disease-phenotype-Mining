<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Incidental findings of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on brain imaging are common, but their clinical significance is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the prevalence of symptomatic and silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on cranial computerized tomography (cCT) and their relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and mortality in a representative sample of 239 85-year-olds living in Gothenburg Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Information on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was obtained from an inpatient hospital linkage system, self-reports, and key informants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was defined according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e>, 3rd revision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cortical and lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were diagnosed on cCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was 17.1%, and half of those were clinically silent (8.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was increased in those with symptomatic (OR, 5.5; 95% CI, 2.1 to 14.1) and silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1 to 6.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> increased the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and its severity in women but not in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 3-year mortality rate was increased in those with symptomatic (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.6 to 9.6) and silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.4 to 8.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Almost one fifth of 85-year-olds have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on cCT, and half of those are clinically silent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are related to an increased rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 3-year mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular disease as a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> may be underrated because of silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It has to be elucidated whether treatment of risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may reduce the consequences of silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
