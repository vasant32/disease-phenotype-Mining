<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients underwent olfactory testing using the Sniffin' Sticks test and olfactory event-related potentials recording </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No responses or longer latencies on the affected side were found, however, when recording evoked potentials </plain></SENT>
