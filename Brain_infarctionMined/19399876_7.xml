<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that MANF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and protein levels are increased in the cerebral cortex after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, a condition that induces ER stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The function of MANF during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> is still not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the protective effect of MANF after ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recombinant human MANF was administrated locally to the cerebral cortex before a 60-min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining indicated that pretreatment with MANF significantly reduced the volume of infarction at 2 days after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MANF also attenuated TUNEL labeling, a marker of cell <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, in the ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Animals receiving MANF pretreatment demonstrated a decrease in body asymmetry and neurological score as well as an increase in locomotor activity after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data suggest that MANF has neuroprotective effects against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, possibly through the inhibition of cell <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
