<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this experiment was to determine if the low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (LMWH) enoxaparin could extend the treatment window for thrombolysis in a mouse model of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To establish the treatment window, mice were treated with tPA 2, 3 or 4 hours after clot insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results showed that only the 2 hour treatment group exhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes significantly smaller than untreated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We attempted to widen this window by pre-treating mice with enoxaparin (10 mg/kg, s.c.; n=36) 1 hour before embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A control group (n=24) was given a saline injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The enoxaparin-treated animals were subdivided and treated with tPA either 4 (n=12) or 6 hours (n=12) after clot insertion, while the third group (n=12) was given saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The saline-pre-treated mice were dived into two groups: one group (n=12) received tPA and the other group (n=12) received saline 4 hours post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Embolization was confirmed by laser Doppler flowmetry and the effects of the resulting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were evaluated by triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining and by behavioral testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results showed large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and impaired sensorimotor coordination in the saline pre-treated animals confirming the narrow treatment window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Enoxaparin pre-treatment produced significantly smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and improved motor behavior in groups treated with tPA both 4 and 6 hours after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neither the 4 nor the 6 hour tPA-treated groups showed evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> or external <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data indicate that the LMWH enoxaparin can significantly increase the therapeutic time window in a mouse model of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
