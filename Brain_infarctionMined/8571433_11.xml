<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The effects of thrombotic occlusion of the middle cerebral artery on compromised ischemic tissue may be different from and more severe than those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced by mechanical occlusion of the artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Photothrombosis, which is based on photochemical damage to the endothelium and subsequent platelet aggregation, is an efficient method to induce <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to improve and simplify this unique method for an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male spontaneously hypertensive rats (5 to 6 months old, 300 to 450 g) were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>, endotracheally intubated, and mechanically ventilated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="25" ids="49696">krypton</z:chebi> laser operating at 568 nm was used to irradiate the exposed distal middle cerebral artery with an intact dura above the rhinal fissure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The photosensitizing dye <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> (20 mg/kg body wt) was administered intravenously over 90 seconds starting simultaneously with 4 minutes of laser irradiation at a power of 20 mW to cause thrombotic occlusion of this artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The irradiated middle cerebral artery was completely occluded by intraluminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> within 3 minutes after simultaneous laser irradiation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thrombosed materials were not stained by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53394">phosphotungstic acid</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> stain (ie, aggregated platelets lacked apparent fibrin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean volume of 3-day-old infarction, indicated by the lack of staining with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>, was 84.8 +/- 17.4 mm3 (mean +/- SD, n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a reproducible and minimally traumatic model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> induced by the thrombotic distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
