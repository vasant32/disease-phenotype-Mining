<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined its role as a risk factor in patients with thrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The association between ACE polymorphism and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was examined in 181 patients with thrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and 271 controls without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The I/D polymorphism was examined using the polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Distributions of the ACE genotypes and alleles did not differ between the infarcted patients and the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both distributions in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> at age 60 years or younger were significantly higher than those in younger controls (genotype: chi 2 = 7.6, P = 0.02; allele: chi 2 = 5.6, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the distributions of ACE genotypes and alleles between the patients with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and with cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were also significant differences in the distribution of ACE genotypes and alleles between the younger and the elderly subgroup of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (genotype: chi 2 = 12.9, P = 0.002; allele: chi 2 = 11.1, P = 0.0009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was a significant decline in the frequency of the ACE D allele with increasing age in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with thrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These observations demonstrated a significant association between the ACE gene polymorphism and thrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in patients age 60 years or younger in a Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there may be an association between the ACE D allele and mortality after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
