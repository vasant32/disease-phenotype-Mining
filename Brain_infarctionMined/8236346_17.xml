<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We performed this multicenter study to explore the full spectrum of the clinical characteristics and neuroimaging findings of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e>, including patients with mild to severe illnesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 293 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> diagnosed by computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging who were admitted to 36 hospitals during 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> constituted 2.3% of the total patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The backgrounds and risk factors were similar to those in patients with infarctions of the cerebral hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At least 24% were embolic, and the diagnosis of embolism could not be ruled out in 27% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> involving the superior cerebellar artery (SCA) region (52%) and the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) region (49%) were far more frequent than those involving the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) region (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with SCA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> exhibited obtunded consciousness and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> more frequently than those with PICA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> in the PICA regions were associated with abnormalities of the PICA (64%) or the vertebral arteries (57%), whereas <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the SCA and AICA regions were associated with abnormalities in the SCA or AICA, respectively, in approximately 30% of patients, in the basilar artery in approximately 16%, and in the vertebral artery in more than 60% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were poorer with SCA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> than with AICA and PICA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate similar frequencies of SCA and PICA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and illustrate the difference in clinical presentation and outcomes between SCA and PICA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They also indicate that not only in situ <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> but also cardiogenic or artery-to-artery embolism and the insufficiency of collateral circulation play important roles in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
