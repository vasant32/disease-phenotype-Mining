<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The technique induced very reproducible unilateral ischemic lesions in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory; hemorrhagic transformation of the lesions was often seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hemodynamic and metabolic effects of blood clot embolism were studied in 35 dogs with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="36932">15O</z:chebi> steady-state technique, and compared with a control group of seven intact animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, the involved brain tissue still had a nearly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oxygen consumption (-11%) despite the lowered tissue perfusion (-20%) caused by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular obstruction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lowered oxygen availability was compensated by an increased oxygen extraction ratio (+11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after the insult, the hemodynamic situation had barely changed, and the ischemic event had evolved into a brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in which oxygen consumption was clearly lowered (-25%) and accompanied by a significant lowering (-22%) of the oxygen extraction ratio compared with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic thrombolysis by local administration of streptokinase (500,000 IU), starting 30 min after the insult, was not able to salvage any brain tissue or to ameliorate tissue perfusion despite angiographically confirmed clot lysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, when fibrinolytic therapy was started within the first 5 min after the insult, hemispheric blood flow was normalized, and most of the threatened brain tissue was salvaged, as was indicated by its normalized oxygen consumption and oxygen extraction ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early fibrinolysis was accompanied by definite clinical improvement and substantial reduction in the severity of the morphological lesions that were never hemorrhagic </plain></SENT>
