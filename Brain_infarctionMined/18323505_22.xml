<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We studied the natural course of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and lacunes, the main MRI representatives of small vessel disease, over time and evaluated possible predictors for their development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Baseline and repeat MRI (3-year follow-up) were collected within the multicenter, multinational Leukoaraiosis and Disability study (n=396) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline WMH were scored on MRI by the Fazekas scale and the Scheltens scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>WMH progression was assessed using the modified Rotterdam Progression scale (absence/presence of progression in 9 brain regions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline and new lacunes were counted per region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>WMH and lacunes at baseline and vascular risk factors were evaluated as predictors of WMH progression and new lacunes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: WMH progressed (mean+/-SD=1.9+/-1.8) mostly in the subcortical white matter, where WMH was also most prevalent at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of new lacunes, which were found in 19% of the subjects (maximum=9), also appeared in the subcortical white matter, mainly of the frontal lobes, whereas most baseline lacunes were located in the basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Baseline WMH and lacunes predicted both WMH progression and new lacunes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were risk factors for WMH progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Male sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, systolic blood pressure, previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, body mass index, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels were risk factors for new lacunes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: WMH and lacunes progressed over time, predominantly in the subcortical white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Progression was observed especially in subjects with considerable WMH and lacunes at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the presence of vascular risk factors at baseline predicted WMH progression and new lacunes over a 3-year period </plain></SENT>
