<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, severe, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000733'>perseverative behavior</z:hpo>, which was apparent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233629" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">thinking</z:e>, speech, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> memory and executive tasks, combined with increased sensitivity to interference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They also showed superimposition of mental activities normally processed sequentially (e.g., giving biographical information while working on a calculation test), which we called palipsychism (from the Greek palin [again] and the Greek psyche [soul]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12 patients (8 with a left-sided <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, 4 with a right-sided <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0454643" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">word-finding difficulties</z:e>, 7 of 12 with impaired naming, 8 of 12 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo>, and 5 of 12 with hypophonia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comprehension, repetition, written abilities, and reasoning were consistently preserved, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo> was usual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had anterograde <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo>, with a delayed recall deficit, primarily verbal in left-sided <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and visuospatial in right-sided <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dysexecutive features such as difficulty in programming motor sequences were always present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Visual neglect or topographic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo> was found in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging emphasized involvement of the anterior group of thalamic nuclei, the mamillothalamic tract, and the anterior part of the internal medullary lamina, with structural sparing of the dorsomedial and ventrolateral nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sequential follow-up examinations showed spectacular improvement within a few months, with the only significant persisting abnormalities being <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory dysfunction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Its association with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000733'>perseverative behavior</z:hpo> with increased sensitivity to interference, anterograde memory retrieval deficit, intrusions, naming difficulties with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> and hypophonia, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo> is suggestive of this type of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
