<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Computer-assisted procedures are used to measure <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas in animal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models, but this approach usually follows the less objective manual tracing of the boundaries of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Building on previously reported methodology using scanned images of triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC)-stained rat brains in the intraluminal thread model, we developed an objective method to assess ischemic damage in both the mouse and rat brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The unique addition to our approach is the use of sham-treated animals, which thereby permits the removal of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain white matter from the ipsilateral injured brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> brain sections per animal were scanned simultaneously using a Microtek Scanmaker 4 flatbed scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Color segmentation on full color images of 2 mm coronal brain sections was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using Image Pro Plus (4.0) and color segmentation, ischemic and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> white matter areas were measured in the green channel and the entire brain area in the red channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percent of unstained tissue was calculated for sham-treated animals and for those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By subtracting the average unstained area of the sham-treated group from the average unstained area from the ischemic group, the ischemic area was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This methodology was validated using mouse and rat permanent and transient, focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> models and MK-801 in the permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MK-801, dosed at 3 mg/kg i.p. prior to the injury, reduced the injury by 75% in the mouse and 44% in the rat permanent occlusion models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The benefits of this methodology include: objectivity of the analysis of the ischemic injury, use of readily available software so that costs can be contained and removal of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subcortical white matter from the calculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This method should allow more consistent evaluation of changes in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, therefore, resulting in reduced variability and higher productivity </plain></SENT>
