<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because TSC is a promising drug candidate to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (AIS), we tested the hypothesis that TSC may be neuroprotective following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> using a rabbit small clot embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model (RSCEM) using clinical rating scores as the endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TSC or saline was administered IV following the injection of small blood clots into the brain vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Behavior was measured 24 h following embolization in order to calculate the effective <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> dose (P(50)) that produces neurological deficits in 50% of the rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A treatment is considered beneficial if it significantly increases the P(50) compared to control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TSC (0.25 mg/kg) given 5 or 60 min following embolization significantly (p&lt;0.05) increased P(50) values by 104% and 181%; but not when given 3 h post-embolization (48% increase, p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>tPA (3.3 mg/kg) produced a significant increase in P(50) when given 1, but not 3 h following embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In combination studies, when TSC was administered 1 h and tPA was given either 1 or 3 h following embolization, the group P(50) values were increased by 291% and 140%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, TSC plus tPA administered 3 h following embolization significantly (p&lt;0.05) increased the group P(50) value by 90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant effects (p&gt;0.05) of either TSC alone or TSC administered in combination with tPA on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that TSC may be used for the treatment of AIS either alone or when administered before or concomitant with tPA to improve clinical rating scores with a therapeutic window for TSC therapy up to 3 h in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it appears that TSC can be administered with tPA, since the combination did not result in any significant change in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> incidence </plain></SENT>
