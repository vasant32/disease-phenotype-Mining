<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent functional animal studies have reported that the motor control of masticatory muscle function is bilaterally guided by both hemispheres, which may fundamentally differ from the cortical control of limb muscle function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether unilateral cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> induces different impairments in masticatory and upper limb motor performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evidence of the importance of both hemispheres in controlling masticatory movements would be greater if the masticatory function were shown to be unimpaired in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The masticatory function of 16 patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in the region of the middle cerebral artery was studied by means of interview, clinical examination, and bite-force measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finger-thumb grip-force measurements and clinical examination of the upper limbs were also performed for evaluation of the effect of infarction on upper limb motor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Localization of the infarction was confirmed with computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Scandinavian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale demonstrated that each patient had a major unilateral cortical infarction which had caused a marked handicap with a serious impairment of upper limb function on the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical examination revealed no major signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039494" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">temporomandibular disorders</z:e>, and the masticatory muscles, when examined by palpation, contracted symmetrically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the patients with unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> showed any differences in bite forces between the healthy and paralyzed sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that, in hemiparetic patients, great differences may exist between the motor performances of the masticatory and upper limb muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present investigation clinically illustrates the importance of both hemispheres in the control of masticatory function and movements </plain></SENT>
