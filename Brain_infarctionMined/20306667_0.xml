<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sickle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (SCA) is the most common type of SCD and represents the homozygous form, in which the individual inherits a double dose of the abnormal gene that codes for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was done to detect cases of silent and clinically overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in children with sickle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (SCA) and examine predisposing factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study included 20 children with clinically and hematologically confirmed SCA and 10 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were divided into two groups, group I; included 10 steady state cases and group II; included 10 cases with thrombotic crisis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were subjected to full clinical examination, measurements of plasma level of: fibrinopeptid A (FPA), thrombin-antithrombin III (TAT), fibrin degradation product (D-dimer) and serum level of platelet endothelial cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (PECAM-1), and analysis of the ACE gene polymorphism by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were further subjected to Brain computed axial tomography (CT) scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as electro-encephalographic studies (EEG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Silent ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> as evidenced by CT scan and/or MRI was present in one patient in group I (10%) and one patient in group II (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, two patients in group II (20%) showed clinically overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, 4 children had silent or clinically overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the remaining 16 were non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Laboratory results showed that the levels of FPA, TAT, D-dimer and PECAM-1 were significantly elevated in SCA patients both in the steady and crisis states as compared to control, with more evident significant elevation in group II (thrombotic crisis) as compared to group I (steady state) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group showed significant elevation; FPA, TAT, D-dimer and PECAM-1 as compared with non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The PCR results showed that the frequencies of both DD genotype and D allele of ACE gene in the thrombotic crisis are significantly higher than in the control group and that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> children are of DD genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, significant increase in FPA, TAT, D-dimer and PECAM-1 levels as well as the presence of ACE D allele of the ACE gene are significant predisposing factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in children with SCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Regular follow-up by thorough neurological examination and neuro-imaging studies for early detection of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> is recommended </plain></SENT>
