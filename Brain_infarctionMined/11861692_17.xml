<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Pathological and clinical data suggest that patients presenting with ischaemic lacunar syndromes may be a heterogenous group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Those with isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> are thought to have localised <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> whereas in those with coexisting leukoaraiois a distinct diffuse small vessel vasculopathy may be the predominant underlying pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism is an important candidate gene in ischaemic cerebrovascular disease but, where lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> specifically has been examined, there have been discrepant reports concerning a possible association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was hypothesised that the influence of the ACE gene may be different among the two subgroups of ischaemic lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> reflecting the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the small vessel disease phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty four consecutive patients presenting with classic lacunar syndromes were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cranial CT to exclude primary intracerebral haemorrhage and these were subsequently assessed for the presence and extent of leukoaraiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were genotyped for the ACE insertion/deletion polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the distribution of ACE genotype with the DD genotype occurring more often in patients with leukoaraiosis and the II and ID genotypes occurring more often among those in whom this was absent (chi(2)=9.06, p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a logistic regression model the ACE DD genotype remained as an independent predictor for the presence of leukoaraiosis (p=0.02) in patients presenting with classic lacunar syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study supports the hypothesis that there may be different types of small vessel disease in patients with classic lacunar syndromes and that the influence of the ACE DD genotype may be relevant in mediating the diffuse form of vessel injury </plain></SENT>
