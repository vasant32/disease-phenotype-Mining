<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously published results of investigations which indicated that the combination of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>, which acts as a free radical scavenger, and perfluorochemicals (PFC), which have a strong oxygen-carrying capacity, can be therapeutic in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present experiment tested the hypothesis that the effectiveness of such treatment could be increased by an optimal combination of such scavengers and other chemicals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two dogs were used, employing the "canine model of a completely ischemic brain regulated with the perfusion method." A total of six drugs with free radical scavenger capacities were tested: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>, vitamin E, <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi>, Nizofenone (Y-9197), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (DEXA) and suloctidil (MY-103) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These drugs were administered intravenously 15 minutes prior to the production of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, when cerebral blood flow was reduced to one-tenth its <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After one hour, recirculation was allowed and the recovery of electrical activity of the brain observed for three hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Judged by the degree of recovery of brain electrical activity, five drugs were considered to have protective effect against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>, vitamin E, MY-103, DEXA and Y-9197 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among these five drugs, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>, vitamin E and DEXA are known to be safe and easily used clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combined administration of these three drugs, together with PFC, was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was found that the speed and degree of recovery of brain electrical activity were greater when these drugs were given together than when one was administered alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
