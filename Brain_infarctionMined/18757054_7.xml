<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We found previously that increased levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> oxidase (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi>) [acetylpolyamine oxidase (AcPAO) plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15746">spermine</z:chebi> oxidase (SMO)], and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> (CH(2)CHCHO) are good markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We then investigated whether silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (SBI) can be detected by measuring <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi>, or other biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several biomarkers were measured in the plasma of 53 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and 44 subjects with SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was found that the levels of protein-conjugated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> (PC-Acro), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly higher in SBI than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi> was slightly higher in SBI than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since the probability of SBI was increased with age, values were analyzed including age as a factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the combined measurements of PC-Acro, IL-6 and CRP were evaluated together with age using a receiver operating characteristic curve, SBI was indicated with 89% sensitivity and 91% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that measurement of PC-Acro together with IL-6 and CRP makes it possible to identify SBI with high sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
