<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> has been implicated as the prominent form of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the brain perihematomal region in animal models and in autopsy or postsurgical human studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both the Fas system and caspase activation play a central role in apoptotic pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to investigate soluble Fas (s-Fas) plasma levels after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>), to determine its influence on clinical and radiologic features, and to assess Fas receptor and Fas ligand (Fas-L) protein expression in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: s-Fas plasma levels were determined on admission in 78 consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> patients and serially in a subgroup of 21 of them, at the time of neurologic assessment, by means of ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> and perihematomal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> volumes were determined at baseline and on follow-up computed tomography scans, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> and perihematomal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> growth was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of Fas receptor and Fas-L was assessed in different brain tissue samples by immunoblotting from 6 deceased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> patients and from 2 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mortality reached 20.5% of patients at the third month, and 48% of survivors had an unfavorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score &gt;/=3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The baseline s-Fas level in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> patients was significantly lower than in healthy controls [160 (160-245) vs 269 (230-332) pg/mL, P&lt;0.001], returning to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values by 24 hours (P&lt;0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> determinations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regarding radiologic features, the baseline s-Fas value was found to be inversely correlated to perihematomal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> growth at follow-up (r=-0.33, P=0.041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, Fas-L content was highest in the perihematomal area compared with contralateral and remote ipsilateral areas in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> patient and control samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A decreased plasma s-Fas level together with an increased Fas-L amount in perihematomal brain tissue suggest Fas-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> involvement in this disease </plain></SENT>
