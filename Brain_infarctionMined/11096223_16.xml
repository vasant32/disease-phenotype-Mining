<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study included 85 patients, average age 71 +/- 8, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (n = 56) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n = 29), who underwent CT (Siemens Somatome DR 1) of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were inpatients in a psychiatric department specialized in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The degree of CT white-matter changes (absence, mild-moderate, severe) was the basis for the division of the patients into three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As the patients without white-matter changes were significantly younger than those with such changes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> statistical analyses were controlled for age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subcortical symptomatology was significantly more frequent in the group with severe white-matter changes, whereas the reverse was true for parietal symptomatology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> and lacunas were significantly more common in patients with white-matter changes, whereas the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> episodes did not differ significantly between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The albumin ratio was significantly higher in the groups with white-matter changes and highest in the group with severe white-matter changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The findings indicate that white-matter changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients are at least partially an age- and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-independent disease manifestation of the vascular system and is associated with a specific symptom pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> dysfunction may be the link between the vasculature and the tissue damage </plain></SENT>
