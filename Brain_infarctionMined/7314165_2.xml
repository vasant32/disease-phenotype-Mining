<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A method for measuring regional cerebral circulation time (rCCT) between the hemispheres using intravenous pertechnetate and a multidetector system is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interhemispheric differences of rCCT instead of absolute values were selected because of the variation of pertechnetate bolus dispersion due to changes in the systemic circulation and injection technique inter-and intraindividually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Time activity curves over one minute were analyzed by a modified gamma function fitting method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results are printed as a brain map which shows reference values and abnormal findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abnormal rCCT asymmetry was observed in 10 out of 77 controls (13%) and 58 out of 65 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (89%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within 2 weeks after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> shorter circulation time values on the side of the lesion than on the contralateral side were found in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the severe infarction cases and in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stages of infarction circulatory changes could be found in a great number of areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with manifest <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> abnormal circulatory findings occurred in larger regions and in a greater number of the patients than in those without that disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the luxury perfusion and diaschisis phenomena, as well as the influence of cross-over of the count rates between the hemispheres, reduce circulatory time differences, use of the present pertechnetate method allows detection of subtle regional circulatory changes in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
