<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Our aim was to describe the prevalence of carotid disorders in a neurosonological study of a sample of patients with LI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analysed the results of the neurosonological study conducted on patients with clinical-radiological criteria of LI who were admitted to our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Unit during the period of study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We studied 140 patients, and results were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in only 42% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stenosis &gt; 50% was found in 10% of the cases and plaque without stenosis in 40.3% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients without plaque there was an increase in the tunica intima-media thickness in 7.2% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In most of the patients with LI there were anomalies in the study of the carotid performed using ultrasound scanning </plain></SENT>
