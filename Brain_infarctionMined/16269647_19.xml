<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this research was to investigate the impact of lesion location on motor excitability and motor performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied patients with pure motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in 4 different brain areas: motor cortex lesions (n=7), striatocapsular lesions (n=13), lacunar lesions of the internal capsule (n=13), and paramedian pontine lesions (n=10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Motor performance tests included the 9-hole-peg test and grip strength recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Motor excitability was determined by transcranial magnetic stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Motor thresholds, stimulus-response curves, silent periods, motor cortical inhibition, and facilitation were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 4 groups were clinically similar but showed major differences in motor excitability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only motor cortex lesions had a loss of intracortical inhibition in the affected hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the internal capsule lesion group and the pontine lesion group, stimulus-response curves were depressed on the affected side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical lesions</z:e> showed a prolongation of the silent period in the paretic side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Motor thresholds were predominantly elevated in the lesioned hemisphere of patients with internal capsule or pontine lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Motor performance was correlated with silent period duration in internal capsule lesions and with motor thresholds in internal capsule and pontine lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Motor cortex lesions exhibited deficient inhibitory properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical lesions</z:e> displayed an enhancement of inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Internal capsule and pontine lesions affecting the corticospinal tract on different levels particularly impaired neuronal recruitment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the lesion location determines a specific pattern of motor excitability changes </plain></SENT>
