<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in this destructive process, but <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes such as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) have been unsatisfactory in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study is an evaluation of the effectiveness of salen-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> complexes, a class of synthetic SOD/catalase mimetics, in a rat focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model involving middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We focus on EUK-134, a newly reported salen-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> complex demonstrated here to have greater catalase and cytoprotective activities and equivalent SOD activity compared with the previously described prototype EUK-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The administration of EUK-134 at 3 hr after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> significantly reduced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, with the highest dose apparently preventing further <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EUK-8 was also protective but substantially less effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings support a key role for ROS in the cascade of brain injury after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, even well after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The enhanced activity of EUK-134 suggests that, in particular, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> contributes significantly to this injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, this study suggests that synthetic SOD/catalase mimetics might serve as novel, multifunctional therapeutic agents for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
