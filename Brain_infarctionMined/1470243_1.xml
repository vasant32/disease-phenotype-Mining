<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, randomized clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: St Lucas Hospital, Amsterdam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Normovolaemic haemodilution was achieved by means of bloodletting and administration of a 20% solution of albumin plus crystalline infusion fluids under haemodynamic and rheological monitoring during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were subjected to general intensive care and monitoring with a pulmonary artery catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This custom-tailored fluid therapy was guided by a pulmonary wedge pressure of 12 mm Hg (SD 3) and a haematocrit (Ht) of 0.32 l/l (SD 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The control group only received individually dosed rehydration with crystalline infusion fluids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endpoints of the study after 3 months were mortality and dependence/independence concerning everyday functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results in the total haemodilution group and the control group did not differ significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, in the subgroup with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Ht (&lt; 0.45 l/l; n = 201) there was a significant reduction (p &lt; 0.05) of the mortality after 3 months (27% and 16%, respectively) and an increase of independence at home (35% and 48%, respectively) due to a reduction of the viscosity by means of haemodilution with albumin (a specific viscosity effect in the normovolaemic group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the control group with raised Ht (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo>; Ht &gt; or = 0.45 l/l; n = 50) there was a significant decrease (p &lt; 0.005) of the mortality after 3 months (27% and 8%, respectively) and an increase of independence at home (35% and 59%, respectively) compared with the control group with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Ht without signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo> (Ht &lt; 0.045 l/l; n = 102), due to rehydration exclusively with crystalline infusion fluids (a specific rehydration effect in the dehydrated group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> patients haemodilution should be adjusted individually; in normovolaemic patients haemodilution should be carried out with an albumin solution; the higher the Ht, the more rehydration with crystalline infusion fluids is to be carried out </plain></SENT>
