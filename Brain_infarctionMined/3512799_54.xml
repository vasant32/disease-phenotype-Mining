<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had pathological FV's over 80 cm/sec between Day 4 and Day 10 after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The side of the ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> showed higher FV's than did the unaffected side in cases of laterally localized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
