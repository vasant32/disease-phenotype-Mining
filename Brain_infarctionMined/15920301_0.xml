<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Thirty-nine patients, after a first <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: motor performance (measured by the Motor Assessment Scale (MAS)), aerobic capacity (measured by Heart Rate (HR) at maximal effort and maximal workload (MWL) at graded stress test), both tested two weeks and three-month post event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Heart Rate Variability (HRV) parameters included time domain (ms) and power spectrum (ms(2)) were tested up to two weeks post event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HRV parameters correlated positively with motor performance and aerobic capacity two weeks (MAS: r(p) = 0.47, p &lt; 0.01, maximal workload: r(p) = 0.26, P &lt; 0.05) and three-month (MAS: r(p) = 0.41, p &lt; 0.01, maximal workload: r(p) = 0.20, not significant) post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HRV in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have positive connection to motor performance and aerobic capacity two weeks post event, and may have a prognostic value to assess motor ability three-month post the event </plain></SENT>
