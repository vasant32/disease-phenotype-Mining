<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Silent or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393970" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">asymptomatic cerebrovascular disease</z:e> is believed to be an important risk factor for symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although non-specific complaints such as mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and/or dizziness may also be caused by silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which remains a topic of controversy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To investigate the relationship between silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and non-specific complaints, we assessed findings on magnetic resonance images using a common protocol in the following three groups of subjects; Group 1:78 subjects with non-specific complaints, Group 2:47 subjects with vascular risk factors, and Group 3:75 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects without any subjective complaints or vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, deep white matter lesions on MRI were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were recruited from 12 institutes of the study group located at various parts of Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were demonstrated in 44%, 43%, and 20% of subjects in Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Group 1, the average number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> per individual who had silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was 1.8, which was significantly fewer than 3.8 in Group 2 or 3.5 in Group 3 (p&lt;0.0167) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>White matter lesions were found in 68%, 49%, and 11% in Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively, indicating that non-specific complaints are more closely related to deep white matter lesions than to silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such white matter lesions were found more frequently in subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011570" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">depressive state</z:e> than in non-depressed subjects (67% vs. 39%, p=0.0155) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present results suggest that deep white matter lesions, rather than silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, appear to be important in producing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and/or dizziness of non-specific cause and also to be related to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011570" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">depressive state</z:e> </plain></SENT>
