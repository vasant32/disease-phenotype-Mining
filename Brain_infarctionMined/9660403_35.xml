<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to develop a model of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the neonatal rat in an attempt to create a reperfusion phase since in the filament model of reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, size limitations precluded performing this procedure before 14 to 18 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We then analyze whether <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> occurs in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven-day-old Wistar rat pups (n = 96) underwent permanent left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in association with 1-hour occlusion of the left common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Evolution of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was studied from 24 hours to 3 months on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi>-stained coronal sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was determined with the use of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> stain 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was demonstrated by the silver staining method of Gallyas et al (1980) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chromatin condensation was shown by DNA fragmentation assessed with the use of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay in cryostat sections and electron microscopic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the animals who survived had reproducible cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was 31+/-7 mm3 (mean+/-SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ipsilateral hemisphere showed a well-delineated lesion in the frontoparietal cortex at 3-month recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Argyrophilic (dying) neurons were observed a few hours after reperfusion and increased with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cells exhibiting DNA fragmentation were shown as early as 6 hours, increased up to and peaked at 24 to 96 hours, then progressively decreased and persisted for several days, suggesting an ongoing process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy analysis demonstrated high condensation and clumping of chromatin beneath nuclear membrane in shrunken neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of performing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion in 7-day-old rats that develop progressive neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> with features characteristic of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The reperfusion phase mimics events that occur during neonatal human hypoxic-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> at birth, since perinatal intensive care most often permits recirculation </plain></SENT>
