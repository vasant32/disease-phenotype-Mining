<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A mismatch between diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MRI is thought to define tissue at risk of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This concept is based on the assumption that diffusion slowing of and decreases in the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) serve as indicator of tissue proceeding to infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MRI (diffusion weighted, perfusion weighted, MRA, T2 weighted) was performed in 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> within 2.9+/-0.8 hours (mean+/-SD) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and on days 1 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After intraindividual realignment of the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps, the development of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> range volumes and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An increase (354%, group A1) in the total <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>-based lesion volume below a threshold of &lt; 80% occurred in 4 patients on day 1, persisting on day 7 with a pronounced increase of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> range volumes with low <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An increase in total <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>-based lesion volume (201%, group A2) followed by a secondary drop to day 7 was found in 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant reduction in total <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>-based lesion volume (14%, group B) was found in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>-based lesion volume increase was associated with persistent vessel occlusion in group A, whereas recanalization in group B resulted in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> volume decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> normalization was observed independently from the degree of the initial <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> decrease on days 1 and 7 in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In line with results from animal experiments, <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> decreases do not reliably indicate tissue infarction Even severely decreased <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values may normalize in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and it seems likely that <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> normalization depends on the duration and severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> rather than the absolute value </plain></SENT>
