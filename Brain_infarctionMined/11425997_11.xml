<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between the patterns of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> that have been associated with hemodynamic impairment and the presence of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hemodynamic compromise (increased oxygen extraction fraction) in a large prospectively enrolled group of patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: At enrollment in a prospective study of cerebral hemodynamics, 110 patients with carotid occlusion underwent (a) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography for the measurement of cerebral oxygen extraction fraction and (b) computed tomographic (CT) or magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) examinations of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> were categorized retrospectively by vascular territory, location, and pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association of these findings with hemodynamic impairment (increased oxygen extraction fraction) was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No border zone-region infarctions were found in 35 asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 75 symptomatic patients, cortical border zone-region infarction was found in seven of 36 patients with increased oxygen extraction fraction, and in two of 39 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oxygen extraction fraction (P =.08, difference not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pattern of multiple white matter lesions arranged parallel to the lateral ventricle was observed only in symptomatic patients with increased oxygen extraction fraction (eight of 36 patients; P =.002; sensitivity, 22%; specificity, 100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This finding was more frequent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging (seven of 14 patients) than with CT (one of 22 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Multiple white matter infarctions, arranged parallel to the lateral ventricle, are associated with severe hemodynamic impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This pattern of infarction is likely due to a hemodynamic mechanism </plain></SENT>
