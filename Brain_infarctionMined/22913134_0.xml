<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate structural organization of microglia of the striatum and of the forebrain periventricular area in rat following transitory focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, ischemic lesion was found to activate microglia, which contributed to rearrangement of striatal neuropil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As microgliocytes became activated, they changed their shape from characteristic dendritic one to oval and rounded, which are typical to amoeboid microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microgliocytes were shown to be capable of proliferation </plain></SENT>
