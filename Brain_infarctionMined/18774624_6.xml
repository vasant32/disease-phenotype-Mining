<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Magnetization transfer ratio [MTR], white matter hyperintensities [WMH], brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> [BA] and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> [BI] were measured in 795 participants of the AGES-Reykjavik Study cohort (mean 75.6 years, 58.9% women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In women, lower MTR, higher WMH and BA, but not BI, remained associated with slower gait independent of each other and of other covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In men, WMH and BA, but not MTR or BI, remained associated with slower gait independently of each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only muscle strength, executive control function and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> test scores substantially attenuated these associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATIONS: MTR in older adults may be an important additional marker of brain abnormalities associated with slower gait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Studies to explore the relationship between brain micro- and macrostructural abnormalities with gait and the role of mediating factors are warranted </plain></SENT>
