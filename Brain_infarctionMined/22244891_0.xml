<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have shown recently that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> is more strongly involved in cell damage than reactive oxygen species during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, we tried to isolate cells with reduced susceptibility to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> toxicity to clarify how <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> is detoxified under cell culture conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The IC(50) of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> in mouse <z:mp ids='MP_0001883'>mammary carcinoma</z:mp> FM3A cells and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> Neuro2a cells was 2.6 and 4.2μM, respectively, but in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> toxicity-decreasing FM3A (FM3A-ATD) cells and Neuro2a (Neuro2a-ATD) cells, it was 7.6 and 8.4μM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both FM3A-ATD and Neuro2a-ATD cells, the concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) was increased, so that detoxification occurred through <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> conjugation with GSH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In FM3A-ATD cells, the level of a rate-limiting enzyme of GSH synthesis, γ-glutamylcysteine ligase catalytic unit (GCLC), was increased through the reactivation of one inactive allele of GCLC genes in FM3A cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Neuro2a-ATD cells, phosphorylation of transcription factors (c-Jun and NF-κB) necessary for expression of genes for GCLC and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> synthetase (GSHS) involved in GSH synthesis was stimulated, so that transcription of two genes increased in Neuro2a-ATD cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase), which catalyzes phosphorylation of c-Jun and NF-κB p65, was also increased in Neuro2a-ATD cells, suggesting that activation of JNK kinase is responsible for the increase in GSH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results support the idea that GSH plays important roles in detoxification of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi>, because GSH is increased in both FM3A-ATD and Neuro2a-ATD cells </plain></SENT>
