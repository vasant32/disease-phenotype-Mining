<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Population based, cross sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Epidemiology of Vascular Ageing study, Nantes, France </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: 780 participants (mean age 69, 58.5% women) with detailed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Brain scans were evaluated for volume of white matter hyperintensities (by fully automated imaging processing) and for classification of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (by visual reading with a standardised assessment grid) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cognitive function was assessed by a battery of tests including the mini-mental state examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 163 (20.9%) participants reported a history of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and 116 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, of whom 17 (14.7%) reported aura symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An association was found between any history of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and increasing volume of white matter hyperintensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The adjusted odds ratio of being in the highest third for total volume of white matter hyperintensities was 2.0 (95% confidence interval 1.3 to 3.1, P for trend 0.002) for participants with any history of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> when compared with participants without severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> being in the lowest third </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The association pattern was similar for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>Migraine with aura</z:hpo> was the only <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> type strongly associated with volume of deep white matter hyperintensities (highest third odds ratio 12.4, 1.6 to 99.4, P for trend 0.005) and with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (3.4, 1.2 to 9.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The location of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was predominantly outside the cerebellum and brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Evidence was lacking for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> for any <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> type with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this population based study, any history of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was associated with an increased volume of white matter hyperintensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>Migraine with aura</z:hpo> was the only <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> type associated with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Evidence that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> of any type by itself or in combination with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> was lacking </plain></SENT>
