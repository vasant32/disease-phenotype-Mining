<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Small subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, also known as lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, comprise more than 25% of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and the underlying vasculopathy is the most common cause of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>How to optimally prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in S3 patients is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Strokes</z:hpo> study (Trial registration: NCT00059306) is to define strategies for reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>, and major vascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Strokes</z:hpo> is a randomised, multicentre clinical trial (n = 3000) being conducted in seven countries, and sponsored by the US NINDS/NIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with symptomatic small subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in the six-months before and an eligible lesion on magnetic resonance imaging are simultaneously randomised, in a 2 Ã— 2 factorial design, to antiplatelet therapy--325 mg aspirin daily plus 75 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> daily, vs. 325 mg aspirin daily plus placebo, double-blind--and to one of two levels of systolic blood pressure targets--'intensive' (&lt;130 mmHg) vs. 'usual' (130-149 mmHg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants are followed for an average of four-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Time to recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (ischaemic or haemorrhagic) is the primary outcome and will be analysed separately for each intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The secondary outcomes are the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and major vascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The primary and most secondary outcomes are adjudicated centrally by those unaware of treatment assignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Strokes</z:hpo> will address several important clinical and scientific questions by testing two interventions in patients with recent magnetic resonance imaging-defined lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, which are likely due to small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results will inform the management of millions of patients with this common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
