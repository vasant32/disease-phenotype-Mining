<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have revealed that (pro)renin receptor ((P)RR), a newly identified member of the renin-angiotensin system, is associated with organ damage that occurs with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association of genetic polymorphisms in the (P)RR gene with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e>, white matter hyperintensity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (LVH) in a Japanese general population recruited from the Ohasama study, a Japanese cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 779 subjects (men=250 and women=529) were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the association study, we selected three polymorphisms: -782A&gt;G (rs2968915), intervening sequence (IVS)5+169C&gt;T (rs5918007) and +1513A&gt;G (rs6609080) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In women, the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> and LVH was significantly higher in subjects with the +1513GG genotype than in those with the AA or AG genotypes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e>: P=0.01, LVH: P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma renin activity (PRA) levels in women with the GG genotype were significantly lower than in women with the AA or AG genotypes (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for confounding factors demonstrated that +1513A&gt;G polymorphism was significantly and independently associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (trend P=0.03) and LVH (trend P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In men, there were no significant differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e>, LVH or PRA levels among the three genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The polymorphism of the (P)RR gene +1513A&gt;G is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> and LVH in Japanese women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that (P)RR has a role in organ damage in humans </plain></SENT>
