<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">Deferoxamine</z:chebi> (DFX), an iron <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelator</z:chebi> stabilizes the HIF-1alpha and activates target genes involved in compensation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we are to investigate whether HIF-1alpha can be stabilized in human neural stem cells (NSCs) by DFX, and pre-transplantation of NSCs with HIF-1alpha stabilization can induce prolonged ischemic tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the DFX-treated NSCs, the HIF-1alpha protein expression was increased about 100-fold time-dependently, and subsequent transcriptional activation (VEGF, BDNF and CXCR4) was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To test an ability to induce ischemic prevention in vivo, DFX-treated NSCs or na√Øve NSCs were transplanted in the striatum of adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven days following the transplantation, focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was done </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The protective effects of NSCs were ablated when HIF-1alpha was silenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HIF-1alpha protein levels were increased in both NSCs-transplanted groups, but more increased in DFX-treated NSCs group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR analysis manifested a downregulation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and MMP-9 in both NSCs groups, but further decrease in DFX-treated NSCs group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings provide evidence that HIF-1alpha stabilization in human NSCs can be achieved effectively by DFX, and HIF-1alpha-stabilized NSCs protect against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in a preventive mode </plain></SENT>
