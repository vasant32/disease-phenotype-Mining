<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is growing evidence that pharmacologic interference with the renin-angiotensin system may reduce risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, although the mechanism is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Impaired reactivity of cerebral vessels has recently been recognized as a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> on cerebral vasomotor reactivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> in patients with lacunar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied a cohort of male patients between 3 and 12 months after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> confirmed on computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each patient received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> 4 mg daily or matching placebo for 2 weeks in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 1-week washout period was observed between dosing periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral vasomotor reactivity (increase in middle cerebral artery mean flow velocity in response to intravenous injection of 15 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>) was measured before and after each dosing period using standard Doppler ultrasound techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients (mean age 63.2+/-2.3 years) completed the protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no treatment order effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cerebral vasomotor reactivity was significantly greater after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> treatment (percent change from baseline +18.8+/-10.1% after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi>, -4.6+/-4.1% after placebo; P=0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Dosing with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> did not affect resting cerebral blood flow velocity (percent change from baseline +3.1+/-9.5% after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi>, -0.6+/-5.4% after placebo), nor was there a change in resting blood pressure (+1.8 mm Hg+/-3.1 after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi>, +1.4 mm Hg+/-2.5 after placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of a significant improvement in cerebral vasomotor reactivity induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi>, beyond any effect on blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results suggest a possible mechanism for the beneficial effect of ACE inhibition on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk observed in recent clinical trials, and suggest a role for the renin-angiotensin axis in the pathophysiology of subcortical small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
