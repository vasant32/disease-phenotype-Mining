<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 20-year-old patient was referred to our clinic after sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of a left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>His past history revealed a severe trauma 4 years ago, including multiple bone fractures, rupture of the spleen, as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> syndrome, from which he showed good recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At that time no central-<z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> symptoms could be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, eighteen months ago, he complained about a transient <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of his left arm and leg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INVESTIGATIONS: Examination of the cerebral arteries by duplex-sonography showed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> on the bifurcation of the right carotid artery with a peripheral flow-reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This could be confirmed by CT- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-based angiography, which also revealed a reopened embolic occlusion of the M1-segment of the right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On CT and diffusion weighted imaging there was evidence of an ischemic infarction pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TREATMENT AND COURSE: Under anticoagulation therapy with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> the patient showed complete recovery from his symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Duplex-sonography as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-angiography documented a complete reopening of the primarily occluded middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, surgical reconstruction of the aneurysmatic part of the vessel was done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the potential risk of a traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> as a potential source of ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We emphasize the importance of imaging the cerebral arteries in traumatic patients, even in the absence of initial neurological symptom </plain></SENT>
