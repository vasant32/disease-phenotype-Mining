<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: An automated image analysis system based on baseline <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps was tested against 30 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> of anterior circulation to predict both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core and salvageable ischemic tissue volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The predicted <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core and predicted salvageable ischemic tissue were quantitatively and qualitatively compared with follow-up imaging data in recanalization and no recanalization groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Direct comparisons with perfusion- and diffusion- weighted magnetic resonance imaging measures were also made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Spearman rank correlation, and Bland-Altman plots were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the recanalization group, the predicted <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core volume was significantly correlated with the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (r = 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>868, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the no recanalization group, the predicted final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (sum of the predicted <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core and salvageable ischemic tissue volumes), as well as the predicted salvageable ischemic tissue volume, was also significantly correlated with the true final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (r = 0.955, P &lt; .001) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth (r = 0.918, P &lt; .001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The volumes of perfusion-diffusion mismatch were significantly larger than those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth and predicted salvageable ischemic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Good agreement between predicted and true final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> lesions was visualized by Bland-Altman plots in two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Direct visual comparative analysis revealed good qualitative agreement between the true final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and predicted lesions in 21 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The proposed <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> based approach may be a feasible and practical tool to predict the volumes of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core and salvageable ischemic tissue without intravenous contrast media-enhanced perfusion-weighted imaging at baseline </plain></SENT>
