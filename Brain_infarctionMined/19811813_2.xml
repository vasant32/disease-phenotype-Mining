<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Verbal repetition is conventionally considered to require motor-reproduction of only the phonologically relevant content of a perceived linguistic stimulus, while imitation of incidental acoustic properties of the stimulus is not an explicit part of this task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exemplar-based theories of speech processing, however, would predict that imitation beyond linguistic reproduction may occur in word repetition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five experiments were conducted in which verbal audio-motor translations had to be performed under different conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nonwords varying in phonemic content, in vocal pitch (F(0)), and in speaking style (schwa-syllable expression) were presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We experimentally varied the factors response delay (repetition vs. shadowing), intention-to-repeat (repetition vs. pseudo-naming), and phonological load (repetition vs. transformation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The responses of ten healthy participants were examined for phonemic accuracy and for traces of para-phonological imitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two aphasic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003910" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">phonological impairments</z:e> were also included, to find out if lesions to left anterior or posterior perisylvian cortex interfere with imitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the healthy participants, significant imitation of both F(0) and phonetic style was observed, with markedly stronger effects for the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Strong imitation was also found in an aphasic patient with a lesion to left anterior perisylvian cortex, whereas almost no imitation occurred in a patient with a lesion to the posterior language area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The degree of unintended imitation was modulated by each of the three independent factors introduced here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results are discussed on the background of cognitive and neurolinguistic theories of imitation </plain></SENT>
