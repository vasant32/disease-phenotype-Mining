<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this case of a left cerebral peduncle infarction, initially the patient was not found with evident right-side <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> but with right-side <z:hpo ids='HP_0003401'>paresthesia</z:hpo> and mild worsening of her underlying left-side <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, including <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of left facial expression and left <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>ptosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Her right limbs became gradually weaker in the first 2 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These bizarre clinical presentations, the mild worsening of the underlying left-side <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, and the delayed presentation of right-side <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> added to the difficulty of making a diagnosis and of the initial localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the magnetic resonance angiography incidentally found an abnormal vessel, which was additional and serpiginous to the right posterior fossa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The right internal carotid artery was markedly smaller than the left one, and a defect was seen around the area of the presumed distal right internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The abnormal cerebral vasculature might be the cause of the unique clinical presentation and might be the contributing factor to the recurrence of her <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the authors report a special case of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on the basis of aberrant cerebral vasculature </plain></SENT>
