<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Reports about neurointensive care of severe community-acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> are few </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this retrospective study were to review the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> clinical course, management and outcome in a series of <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> patients receiving neurointensive care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty patients (median age 51, range 1-81) admitted from a population of 2 million people during 7 years were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neurointensive care protocol included escalated stepwise treatment with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo>, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage, continuous thiopentotal infusion and decompressive craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was assessed using the Glasgow outcome scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients did not respond to commands on arrival, five were non-reacting and five had <z:mp ids='MP_0002546'>dilated pupils</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients had positive CSF cultures: Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=18), Neisseria meningitidis (n=2), Î²-streptococcus group A (n=1) and Staphylococcus aureus (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients were mechanically ventilated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure (ICP) was monitored in 28 patients (intraventricular catheter=26, intracerebral transducers=2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CSF was drained in 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three patients received thiopentothal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Increased ICP (&gt;20 mmHg) was observed in 7/26 patients with available ICP data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Six patients died during neurointensive care: total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (n=4), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> (n=1) and treatment withdrawal (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Seven patients died after discharge, three due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, 14 patients showed good recovery, six moderate disability, two severe disability and 13 were dead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients judged to have severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> should be admitted to neurointensive care units without delay for ICP monitoring and management according to modern neurointensive care principles </plain></SENT>
