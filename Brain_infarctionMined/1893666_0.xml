<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the study was to elucidate factors influencing long-term change in CBF in two subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> of different mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Those patients were excluded from the study, who had bilateral hemispheric lesions, significant arterial lesion in the contralateral carotid axis and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> before the second measurement of CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 46 patients studied, 23 (17 men and 6 women) were classified as atherothrombotic and 23 (15 men and 8 women) as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264978" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic infarction</z:e> based on the diagnostic criteria reported earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 60.6 +/- 8.9 years old (mean +/- S.D.) for atherothrombotic patients, and 60.2 +/- 11.0 years old for embolic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first measurement of CBF was performed between 31 and 87 days and the second measurement between 13 and 99 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In atherothrombotic group, mean hemispheric CBF (mCBF) of the affected side tended to be higher in patients examined at intervals shorter than 30 months, but tended to decrease in those at longer interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The multivariate stepwise regression analysis indicated only "the interval between 2 measurements" to have a significant effect on reduction of mCBF, although in addition to the interval (p less than 0.05), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-size (p less than 0.01) and change in PaCO2 (p less than 0.05) were suggested to be possible factors by single regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In embolic group, an increase in hematocrit had a significant effect on reduction of mCBF, even when being evaluated with multivariate stepwise regression analysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
