<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The mouse model of transcranial permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (tpMCAO) is widely used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we quantified <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size using a conventional histological method at several post-ischaemic times, going beyond the commonly analysed period of up to 2 days, following <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two different mouse strains, which are widely used for pharmacological studies of neuroprotection and for genetic engineering, were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A drill whole was made into the skull of anaesthetised mice and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> was induced by electrocoagulation of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both mouse strains tested (C57Black/6 and NMRI), the measured <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes decreased significantly during the first days after tpMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Notably, 13 days after surgery, ischaemic and sham-operated animals had indistinguishably small lesions, which where in the range of only 5% of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size on day 2 post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The standard method of calculating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> and shrinkage correction provided no sufficient explanation for this significant decrease in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was, however, evidence that structural changes in the residual ipsilateral hemisphere may compromise the significance of results arising from the method of calculating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> and shrinkage correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our study indicates that the pronounced and fast, time-dependent decrease in histologically defined <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume can compromise results when studying the lasting neuroprotective effects of potential drugs </plain></SENT>
