<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate associations between vascular risk factors and changes in burden of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, ventricular size (VS), sulcal widening (SW), and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in an initially middle-aged, biracial cohort from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities (ARIC) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Initial brain magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) scans and evaluations for vascular risk factors were performed in 1,812 ARIC participants in 1994-1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 2004-2006, 1,130 ARIC participants underwent repeat <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> scans were rated using a validated 9-point scale for VS, SW, and WMH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to assess associations between vascular risk factors and change between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> scans of one or more grades in VS, SW, WMH, or appearance of new <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, controlling for age, sex, and race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, the 1,112 participants with usable scans (385 black women, 200 black men, 304 white women, 223 white men) had a mean age of 61.7 Â± 4.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In adjusted models, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline was associated with incident <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (odds ratio [OR] 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-2.95) and worsening SW (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.36-3.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> at baseline was associated with incident <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.23-2.42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In subjects with the highest tertile of fasting blood sugar and systolic blood pressure at baseline, the risk of incident <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was 3.68 times higher (95% CI 1.89-7.19) than those in the lowest tertile for both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Both atrophic and ischemic imaging changes were driven by altered glycemic and blood pressure control beginning in midlife </plain></SENT>
