<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lack of elevations of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> index with advancing age was shown in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the observation period (mean 23.3 years), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> developed in three patients, (brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> in each) but none of the patients died from such diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the morbidity and mortality of arteriosclerotic diseases were less frequent than those reported in the community population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This observation seems to be attributable to the dietary and environmental control of risk factors during the long-term hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, total protein, hematocrit, cardiothoracic ratio and calcification of the aorta on the chest X-ray, echocardiographic findings, plasma renin activity and plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> concentration at the final examination in 1993 were similar to those seen in the community population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that long-term control of risk factors by hospitalization results in the lack of blood pressure increase with age and less prevalence of arteriosclerotic diseases </plain></SENT>
