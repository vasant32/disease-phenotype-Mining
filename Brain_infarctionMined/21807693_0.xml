<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here the case of an infant who was born to a mother with White's class C <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> during an episode of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DKA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Throughout pregnancy her <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control was suboptimal, as evidenced by a predelivery glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level of 8.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 33 weeks' gestation, the mother presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo>, a serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration of 575 mg/dL, and other metabolic derangements consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DKA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite rehydration and insulin therapy, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015930" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal distress</z:e> necessitated cesarean delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At birth the infant required intubation, but her clinical status quickly improved and she was extubated within the first day of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, on day-of-life 4 she exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-like activity, and subsequent brain MRI revealed bilateral basal ganglia infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Previous research has revealed that the keto acid β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) can cross the placenta into the fetal circulation and thereafter accumulate in the fetal brain, which leads to severe metabolic derangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, β-OHB accumulates rapidly in the basal ganglia of older children during episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DKA</z:e>, wherein its presence is associated with neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suspect that transplacental transfer of maternal β-OHB led to an acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001993'>ketoacidosis</z:hpo> in the fetus and that accumulation of β-OHB contributed to neuronal injury and subsequent infarction of the basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further research is necessary to better characterize neonatal complications of maternal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DKA</z:e>, as well as the possible inclusion of β-OHB levels in the goal-directed treatment of this disease </plain></SENT>
