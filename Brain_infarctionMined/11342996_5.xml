<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Some 273 asymptomatic carotid plaques (218 patients) causing 50 to 99% stenosis were studied with high-resolution ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>B-mode images were digitised and normalised by assigning certain grey values to blood and adventitia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The grey scale median (GSM) of the plaque in the normalised image was used to quantify echogenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Every patient had a CT-brain scan which an independent neuroradiologist read </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of 1) non-lacunar and 2) lacunar silent CT-brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> ipsilateral to the carotid plaque was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean GSM of plaques associated with non-lacunar silent CT-brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was 19.6, of plaques associated with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was 35.5 and of those associated with no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was 32 (p=0.008, ANOVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean degree of stenosis was 79%, 72% and 73% respectively (p = 0.1, ANOVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plaque echogenicity (p = 0.007) and not the degree of stenosis (p = 0.07) predicted the presence of non-lacunar silent CT-brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (logistic regression) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Carotid bifurcation plaques, which are associated with non-lacunar silent CT-brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, are significantly more hypoechoic than those associated with lacunar or no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Plaques associated with lacunar silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> have the same echogenicity and degree of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest an embologenic mechanism of non-lacunar silent CT-brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> that may have prognostic implications in patients with asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies of asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> should assess the significance of 1) plaque echogenicity and 2) the presence of different types of silent CT-brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and atheroembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
