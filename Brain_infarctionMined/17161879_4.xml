<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the correlation between the apoptotic index and the expression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> modulators and stress response in an ultraviolet-induced cortical microinfarct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult rat neocortex was exposed to an ultraviolet beam and brains removed at different intervals after injury were paraffin-embedded and processed for TUNEL assay and immunohistochemistry against apoptotic modulators Bax and Bcl-2, and stress protein HSP70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the 12-72h postirradiation period, apoptotic nuclei decreased from 11% to 4% in the infarcted area whereas only 1.2% of such nuclei was seen in the perilesional area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While Bcl-2 was always negative in the lesion focus, Bax was positive at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> survival times, mainly in glial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HSP70 was expressed over a broad area of the ipsilateral hemisphere from 3h after brain injury, firstly in neurons and progressively in glial cells and finally in endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At longer survival times, positive cells could be also seen in the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> seems to play only a quantitatively modest role in the progression of brain damage in penumbra areas despite the wide expression of pro-apoptotic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand HSP70 appears to be one of the main protective responses to injury stress </plain></SENT>
