<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a 57-year-old man with an ischemic lesion in the midbrain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage, he presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001488'>bilateral ptosis</z:hpo> and markedly limited extraocular motion except for bilateral abduction and downward motion of the right eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pupillary reaction to light of his left eye also was impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He was admitted to our hospital, and brain MRI showed a small infarction extending from the left paramedian to the median tegmentum of the midbrain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three weeks after admission, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>ptosis</z:hpo> and limited extraocular right eye motion had resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pupillary reaction and downward motion of the left eye normalized gradually within 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two months after admission, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>ptosis</z:hpo> and the limited left <z:mp ids='MP_0006155'>eye adduction</z:mp> were partially resolved, but the markedly limited upgaze of the left eye had not changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Initial neuro-ophthalmologic findings suggested involvement of the caudal part of the oculomotor nucleus and the left oculomotor nerve within the midbrain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pattern of neuro-ophthalmologic impairment seen in our patient led us to conclude that the caudal oculomotor nucleus and medial part of the fascicular fibers of the left oculomotor nerve probably recovered first, after which recovery of the fascicular fibers progressed laterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of serial MRI were consistent with this interpretation </plain></SENT>
