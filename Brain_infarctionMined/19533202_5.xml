<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies focusing on the elderly population, where SBI is most common, are sparse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the associations between SBI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MetS) in healthy elderly individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurologically healthy subjects (1,254 persons, 723 males) aged &gt; or =65 years who underwent brain MRI were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MetS was diagnosed following the <z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi>/NHLBI-2005 criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We examined associations between full syndrome (at least three of the five conditions) as well as its components and SBI while controlling for possible confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred and ninety-seven subjects (15.7%) were found to have one or more SBIs on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age (1-year difference) was found to be significantly related to SBI prevalence (OR 1.09; 95% CI 1.05-1.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MetS was significantly associated with SBI (OR 1.68; 95% CI 1.15-2.44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The component model of MetS showed a strong significance between elevated blood pressure (OR 1.89; 95% CI 1.23-2.91) and SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subjects exhibiting more components of MetS showed more prevalent SBI and multiple SBIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MetS was found to be significantly associated with SBI in neurologically healthy elderly people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The positive trend between the number of MetS components and SBI could be used as a diagnostic tool to predict and prevent future <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
