<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The treatment of giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> requires a thorough surgical and endovascular planning as this entity is accompanied by complex vascular and blood flow particularities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Even in experienced neurovascular centers the clinical outcome varies considerably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within a series of 1386 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> patients 72 (5%) giant (&gt;25 mm) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated in our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their age ranged between 26 and 81 years (medium age 52 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>22 patients were suffering of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally there were 50 patients with nerve palsies or unspecific symptoms due to unruptured giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (UGA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment modalities included surgical clipping (n = 35), balloon occlusion of the ICA (n = 12), endovascular coiling (n = 7) or a combined regimen of balloon occlusion, surgical clipping and EC-IC bypass (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>10 patients could not be treated on due to their high age or minor clinical status (H&amp;H IV and V) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>6 of 15 (40%) SAH-patients were discharged without any complaints compared to 26% (12 of 47 patients) in the group of unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>1 SAH-patients (7%) versus 13 UGA (28%) patients suffered persisting nerve palsies or minor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>32% (n = 15) of the UGA-patients were suffering of major neurological deficits and required further professional help </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>5 patients remained in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917808" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vegetative state</z:e>, 3 of these had been admitted with an incidental finding of an UGA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>6 of 15 (40%) SAH-patients died, 5 of them admitted with H&amp;H grade IV or V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However only 3 of 47 (6%) UGA patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>2 of these had a fatal SAH before treatment, 1 underwent EC-IC bypass surgery with insufficient hemispheric vascularization followed by gross infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The clinical status and age of the patient are significant factors influencing treatment associated morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The individual vascular situation may lead to a complex therapeutical regimen thereby predisposes higher complication rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>We believe that surgical clipping is the first choice of treatment allowing temporarily clipping and reconstruction of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> by shrinking or/and reconstructive clipping while reducing the mass effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Whereas endovascular coiling alone is less favorable due to the packing of the coils a combined endovascular and surgical approach have to be considered in selected cases </plain></SENT>
