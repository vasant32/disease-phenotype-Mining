<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A case report illustrating the rare occurrence of thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002385'>paraparesis</z:hpo> following the presumed occurrence of an embolic vascular event during lumbar spinal surgery is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal is to investigate the potential causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002385'>paraparesis</z:hpo> following lumbar spine surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A discussion of the symptoms, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752130" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord ischemia</z:e> and postembolic infarction is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This manuscript is intended to heighten the awareness of the potential for this rare complication to improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis, allowing the timely institution of appropriate treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data analyzed include the patient history, preoperative and postoperative physical examination, clinical course, imaging studies, and input of various consulting services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A review of the English literature on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752130" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord ischemia</z:e> and postembolic infarction was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most likely etiology for the patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002385'>paraparesis</z:hpo> appears to be related to an embolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748902" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Management of a spinal cord ischemic event should focus on the following key issues: a prompt diagnosis with timely perioperative imaging studies (magnetic resonance imaging), the attainment of a normotensive state, the institution of systemic anticoagulation if clinically warranted, and maximization of physical function through early rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
