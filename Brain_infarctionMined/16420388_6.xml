<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study attempts to clarify the pathogenesis of LA by testing the hypothesis that increased frequency of LA with occlusive extra-cranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> results directly from global reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and 55 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (&gt;70%) were studied using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CBF was measured using phase contrast <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography and LA was scored using previously validated scoring system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into those with evidence of previous infarction on MRI and those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LA was more severe in patients than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (P&lt;0.01) and correlated with age in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects but not in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CBF in patients with (809+/-214 ml/min) and without infarction (mean 792+/-181 ml/min) was significantly lower than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (mean 1073+/-194 ml/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the severity of LA and measured CBF in any group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The severity of LA is greater in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> but is not correlated to reductions in CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that microvascular abnormality is the dominant pathogenetic factor in LA even in the presence of severe stenotic/occlusive large vessel disease </plain></SENT>
