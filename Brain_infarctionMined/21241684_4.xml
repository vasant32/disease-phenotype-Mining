<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the expression and potential role of NDRG2 in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> brain remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein, we investigated spatial-temporal expression of NDRG2 in the rat brain following transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a 120-min transient occlusion of middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were killed and brain samples were harvested at 4, 12, 24, and 72h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of NDRG2 in the brain was determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cellular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was assessed by TUNEL staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed that NDRG2 was expressed on cells with an astrocytes-like <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in ischemic penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NDRG2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression began to increase at 4h after reperfusion and peaked at 24h in the ischemic penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By using immunofluorescence, NDRG2 signals were co-localized with GFAP-positive astrocytes, and NDRG2 expression in astrocytes translocated from a cytoplasm to a nuclear localization at 24h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Double immunofluorescent staining for TUNEL and NDRG2 showed that some NDRG2 signals co-localized with TUNEL-positive cells, and that the apoptotic cells increased with enhancement of NDRG2-positive signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, NDRG2 expression is up-regulated in ischemic penumbra following transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>NDRG2 expression in astrocytes may play important pathological roles in cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
