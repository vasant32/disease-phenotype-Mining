<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of somatosensory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> with jacksonian march was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient was given antiepilectics but 5 days later, a few hours after another paresthesic episodes, he developed right <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>, hemianesthesia and dysartria due to an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> of left capsular posterior limb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We deem that in this patient the paresthesic episodes were more likely an expression of a capsular warning syndrome than of parietal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> because of the frontal localization of the surgical lesion, the absence of motor components in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> episodes, the negativity of repeated EEG, and the lack of recurrences after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In capsular warning syndrome sensory symptoms mimicking a jacksonian march can be due to ischemic depolarization progressively recruiting the somatotopically arranged sensory fibers in the posterior capsular limb </plain></SENT>
