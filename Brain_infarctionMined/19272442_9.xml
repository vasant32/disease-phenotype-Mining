<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22798">beta-D-glucoside</z:chebi> (TSG), an active component of the rhizome extract from Polygonum multiflorum, exhibits antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we used an in vitro ischemic model of oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation followed by reperfusion (OGD-R) and an in vivo ischemic model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) to investigate the neuroprotective effects of TSG on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion brain injury and the related mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that OGD-R-induced neuronal injury, intracellular ROS generation, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential dissipation were reversed by TSG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The elevation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi>-induced [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i was also attenuated by TSG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Bcl-2 family-related apoptotic signaling pathway was involved in the neuroprotection afforded by TSG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, TSG inhibited iNOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression induced by OGD-R, which may be mediated by the activation of SIRT1 and inhibition of NF-kappaB activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vivo studies further demonstrated that TSG significantly reduced the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and the number of positive cells by TUNEL staining in the cerebral cortex compared to the MCAO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study indicates that TSG protects against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury through multifunctional cytoprotective pathways </plain></SENT>
