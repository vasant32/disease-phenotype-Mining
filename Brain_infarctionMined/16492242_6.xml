<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It has been recently demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> is characterized by subclinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> and white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several genetic risk factors have been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, but no study has unraveled a possible relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> and Notch3, which is involved in vascular damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations in Notch3 gene have been demonstrated to be pathogenetic for CADASIL, a small vessel disease of the brain characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 156 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> patients and 128 nonheadache healthy volunteers entered the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Demographic and clinical characteristics were carefully recorded, and a neurological work-up was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, each subject underwent a blood sampling for Notch3 genotype determination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Notch3 genotypes as well as allele frequencies did not differ in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> patients compared to controls, even adjusting for the presence of possible confounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No difference has been found either in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> patients with aura or in those without aura </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the view that functional polymorphism T6746C in Notch3 gene is not involved in increasing the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
