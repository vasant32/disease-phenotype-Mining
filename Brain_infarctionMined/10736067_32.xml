<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> varied in age from 18 h to several months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was characterized morphologically by cell shrinkage, cytoplasmic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745091" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypereosinophilia</z:e> and moderate nuclear pyknosis with later chromatin dispersal and disintegration, but not features of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Occasional apoptotic bodies were seen but these appeared to be related to inflammatory cells, endothelial cells and occasional glia, including satellite cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurones within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> showed strong nuclear and cytoplasmic labelling for CASP3 during the first 2 days after infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuronal DNA-PKCS, PARP and poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) immunoreactivity was demonstrable in scattered neurones in and adjacent to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> for 18-24 h but thereafter declined to below detectable levels in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TUNEL labelled cells towards the edge of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, particularly at 2-4 days, but most of the labelling could be prevented by preincubation of the sections in diethyl pyrocarbonate to inactivate endogenous nucleases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Between 3 days and 3 weeks, CASP3 and DNA-PKCS were detected in proliferating capillaries and CASP3, PARP and poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) in infiltrating macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in human brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> has some of the early biochemical features of programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, with upregulation of CASP3 and rapid disappearance of DNA-PKCS and PARP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the morphological changes are not those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, the DNA cleavage occurs relatively late, and some of the TUNEL is probably mediated by the release of endogenous endonucleases during protease or microwave pretreatment of the damaged tissue </plain></SENT>
