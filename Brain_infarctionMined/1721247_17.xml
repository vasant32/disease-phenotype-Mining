<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to compare intracardiac perfusion of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> with immersion of brain tissue in 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> to delineate brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After 6, 24, or 48 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, some rats were perfused with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>; other rats were given an overdose of <z:chebi fb="25" ids="22693">barbiturates</z:chebi>, after which brain sections were immersed in 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coronal sections were taken 4, 6, and 8 mm from the frontal pole, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas in perfused and immersed sections were compared; subsequently, the same sections were stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In rats subjected to 24 or 48 hours of occlusion, areas of infarction were clearly defined with both 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining techniques, and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> sizes correlated well with the results of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining (r = 0.85-0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that intracardiac perfusion of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> is an accurate, inexpensive, and efficient staining method to detect infarcted tissue 24 and 48 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
