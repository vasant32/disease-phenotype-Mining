<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether the acoustic startle reflex (ASR) was sensitive to lesions induced by focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats were pre-screened for startle reflex responses 3-6 days prior to surgery and there were no differences in mean startle amplitude across groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAo) or a sham surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours later rats were evaluated for ASR prior to sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were subsequently determined by quantitative image analysis of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>-stained brain sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes of rats undergoing pMCAO ranged from 0 to 48% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data were divided into three groups based upon percent infarction: mild (0-20%), moderate (21-35%), and severe (&gt;35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A within-subject analysis revealed a significant decrease in mean startle amplitude of only severely infarcted rats relative to their pre-surgery startle responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the lesioned brain areas observed in these animals provide an anatomical basis for these results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrate that ASR is affected in a model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further work is needed to characterize this behavioral test and to determine whether it may have application as a surrogate endpoint for clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> studies </plain></SENT>
