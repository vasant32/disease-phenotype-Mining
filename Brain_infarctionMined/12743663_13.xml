<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histological examination has demonstrated these to be "cortical laminar <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>", without haemorrhage or calcification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report serial MRI in this condition in 12 patients with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We looked at high-signal lesions on T1-weighted images, chronological changes in signal intensity and contrast enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High-signal cortical lesions began to appear about 2 weeks after the ictus, were prominent at 1-2 months, then became less evident, but occasionally remained for up to 1.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They gave high signal or were isointense on T2-weighted images and did not give low signal at any stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Contrast enhancement of these lesions was prominent at 1-2 months, and less apparent from 3 months, but was seen up to 5 months </plain></SENT>
