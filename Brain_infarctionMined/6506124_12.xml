<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Between 1980 and 1982, 227 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) or ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (IBI) were evaluated as possible candidates for carotid surgery in the Department of Neurology, University of Helsinki </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and ten patients (mean age 58, range 41-72 years) were selected for surgery; 82 of them had had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and 28 IBI as the presenting symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After a total of 128 operations (84 unilateral and 18 bilateral endarterectomies, and 8 arterial reconstructions), 16 patients (14.5%) developed neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 7 patients (6.4%), the deficit was severe and 4 of them (3.6%) died within the first four days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had occlusion of the contralateral internal carotid artery and/or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five of them suffered ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> after the operation and two died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Operation on an occluded internal carotid artery in 7 patients was complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> in two patients, one of whom died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with surgical complications more often had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (p less than .001), total occlusion of the contralateral internal carotid artery, (n.s.) and severe angiographic changes (n.s.) compared with patients without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up the annual rate for IBI was 3.3% and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>) 4.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred with a frequency of 1.7% per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results emphasize that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or IBI should be carefully evaluated before recommending surgical treatment for prevention of threatened <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with severe risk factors may fare better on medical treatment than with surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
