<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We investigated the role of monocyte-recruiting chemokines in cerebrovascular diseases among the subjects of the GENIC case-control study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (BI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Of the genotypes tested, only homozygosity for the rare CX3CR1 alleles was more frequent in cases than in controls: the I249 and M280 alleles were associated with an increased risk of BI (OR, 1.66 and OR, 2.62 with P&lt;0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This effect was independent of other established risk factors and uncorrelated with disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study confirmed previous reports of a dominant protective association between CX3CR1-I249 allele and the risk of cardiovascular history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk of BI associated with homozygosity for the rare CX3CR1 alleles was enhanced in patients with no previous cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ex vivo studies showed that the number of monocytes adhering to immobilized CX3CL1, the CX3CR1 ligand, increased proportionally to the number of CX3CR1 mutated alleles carried by the individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The rare CX3CR1 alleles were associated with an increased risk of BI and with reduced frequency of cardiovascular history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We propose that the extra <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of monocytes observed in individuals carrying rare alleles of CX3CR1 may favor mechanisms leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
