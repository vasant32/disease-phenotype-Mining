<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Motor excitability was assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation techniques and electrical peripheral nerve stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Motor function was evaluated by the Nine-Hole-Peg Test and measurement of hand grip strength </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The affected side was compared with the non-lesioned side and with an age-matched control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients had a loss of inhibition and an increase of facilitation in the motor cortex of the affected side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The silent period was prolonged and motor function was impaired on the affected side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A thalamic lesion can modulate motor cortical excitability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: This study suggests that, under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions, somatosensory afferents influence inhibitory and excitatory properties in the motor cortex </plain></SENT>
