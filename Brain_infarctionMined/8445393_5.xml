<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adequate localization was achieved in 98% of 246 patients with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These and 30 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> patients were followed for a median of 1082 days (range 2-1657) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients were invalidated by evidence of serious underreporting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> in our general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 212 male patients with cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> not due to cardiogenic embolism, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, or other unusual etiologies, 1-, 12-, and 36-month recurrence rates were 23%, 31% and 39% among patients with large vessel anterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>; 15%, 20% and 28% among patients with large vessel posterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>; and 8%, 16% and 21% among patients with lacunar anterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six patients with posterior circulation lacunes did not experience recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparative case fatality data were also compiled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Large vessel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> tended to be followed by further large vessel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, usually in the same vascular distribution, whereas lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were not predictive of the type or location of subsequent events </plain></SENT>
