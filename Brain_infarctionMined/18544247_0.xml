<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein, we aimed to develop imaging criteria to classify the ischemic lesion by computed tomography (CT) perfusion (<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi>) and CT angiography (CTA) in hyperacute <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Non-contrast-enhanced CT, <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> and CTA were performed in patients with symptoms of hyperacute <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lasting &lt;8 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to the volume of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core, ischemic penumbra and vessel status, three ischemic lesion types were defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients were included in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among them, ten patients were classified into severe group, 15 patients were classified into mild group and one patient was classified into reversible group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, the ischemic lesion typing may assist in individualizing therapeutic decisions for patients by possibly extending the window for giving thrombolytics beyond the current 3 hour limit </plain></SENT>
