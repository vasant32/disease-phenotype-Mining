<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IV-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> thrombolysis has been approved recently in Singapore for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Continuous exposure of clot to 2-MHz pulsed-wave transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound during IV-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> infusion is known to augment thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the feasibility, safety and efficacy of ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Singapore </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial-occlusions</z:mp> were treated with standard IV-tPA and continuously monitored with 2-MHz TCD according to the CLOTBUST-trial protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arterial recanalisation was determined with Thrombolysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain Ischemia</z:e> (TIBI) flow-grading system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Safety and efficacy of ultrasoundassisted thrombolysis were assessed by rates of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (sICH) and functional recovery at 1 month, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five consecutive patients (mean age 58 years, 3 men and 3 of Chinese ethnicity) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean time elapsed between symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and presentation to emergency room was 98 minutes (range, 50 to 135 minutes) while the mean time interval between symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to IV-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> bolus was 144 minutes (range, 125 to 180 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Partial or complete recanalisation with reduction in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity was noted in 4 out of the 5 patients during IV-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> infusion (mean change in NIHSS = 4 points; range 2 to 8 points) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of our patients developed sICH while 4 patients demonstrated good functional outcome at 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary study demonstrates the feasibility, safety and efficacy of ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Singapore </plain></SENT>
