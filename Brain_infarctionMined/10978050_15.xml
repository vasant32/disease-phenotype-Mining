<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to assess the reproducibility, interobserver variability, and application to clinical studies of a new method for the quantitative assessment of carotid plaque echogenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Carotid plaques were scanned with the use of ultrasound, and their images were stored in a computer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were normalized by assigning certain gray values to blood and adventitia, and the gray scale median (GSM) was used to quantify their echogenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The variability between storage media, between degrees of magnification, and between probes was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The method was applied to 232 asymptomatic carotid plaques causing 60% to 99% stenosis in relation to the presence of ipsilateral CT-demonstrated brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parts of the study the plaque GSM was measured before and after normalization to evaluate its effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement for the scanning process was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The GSM mean difference before and after normalization for variability studies of storage media, degrees of magnification, and probes was -14.5 and -0.12, 2.24 and 1.68, and -8.3 and -0.7, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median GSM of plaques associated with ipsilateral nonlacunar silent CT-demonstrated brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was 14, and that of plaques that were not so associated was 30 (P:=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The interobserver GSM difference was -0.05 (95% CI, -1.7 to 1.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our method decreases the variability between storage media and between probes but not the variability between degrees of magnification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It separates echomorphologically the carotid plaques associated with silent nonlacunar CT-demonstrated brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> from plaques that are not so associated </plain></SENT>
