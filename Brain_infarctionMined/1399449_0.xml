<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: T1 was measured from magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of 29 patients as a function of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> location and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Another group of 11 patients was studied with consecutive MRI studies during the first 5 weeks after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, and the distribution of T1 in the infarctions was analyzed from T1 maps using a histographic method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the first 2 months after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, T1 was longer in the infarcted gray matter than in the infarcted white matter (P = .002), and prolonged linearly in both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The histographic analysis showed a component arising from tissue breakdown products that could be identified for up to 5 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A transient lengthening in T1 of the contralateral hemisphere, reaching a maximum at 3 weeks, also was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These characteristics of recent infarctions differentiate them from older, gliotic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lengthening of T1 in the contralateral hemisphere may reflect remote flow and metabolic effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
