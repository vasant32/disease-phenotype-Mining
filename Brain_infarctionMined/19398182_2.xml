<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Occasionally, unilateral lesions may produce bilateral hypogeusia and contralateral hypoacusia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report 2 patients with unilateral lower midbrain ischemic lesions of the inferior colliculus level caused by transarterial embolization for tentorial dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> (TDAVFs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Hospital records for 21 patients with TDAVFs mainly treated by endovascular techniques between 2005 and 2008 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients with MRI evidence of unilateral SCA territory infarction were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 21 patients, 2 treated transarterially with Onyx-18 (a nonahesive liquid embolic agent) developed infarctions in the territory of SCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient had lateral SCA infarction characterized by ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002066'>gait ataxia</z:hpo>, contralateral hemihypoesthesia, with additional ipsilateral ocular motor palsy and bilateral gustatory loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>And the other patient had medial SCA infarction characterized by ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> contralateral hemihypoesthesia with additional contralateral hypoacusia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SCA infarction can be caused by transarterial injection of Onyx-18 via SCA or the posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) for TDAVFs and additionally presented with gustatory loss and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo>, which is generally not a feature of the SCA syndrome </plain></SENT>
