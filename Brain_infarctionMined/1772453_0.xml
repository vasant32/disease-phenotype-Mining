<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After injection of tranylcypromine (a MAO inhibitor), spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) which had been previously infused with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> (NE) for 14 days displayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related behaviour including kangaroo-like posture, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Administration of oxiracetam at doses of 400 and 800 mg/kg/d p.o. for 14 days before tranylcypromine injection inhibited the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related behaviour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bilateral common carotid and vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> induced electroencephalogram (EEG) flattening, the EEG recovering gradually after re-perfusion of cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Oxiracetam administered after the re-perfusion at a dose of 100 mg/kg, i.v. accelerated the recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This facilitatory effect was not seen when either piracetam (50 and 100 mg/kg i.v.) or idebenone (50 and 100 mg/kg i.v.) were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of middle cerebral artery produced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and disturbed the circadian rhythm of spontaneous motor activity with an relative increase of activity in the light period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment with oxiracetam (400 mg/kg/d p.o.) for 14 days after the occlusion showed a tendency to an improvement in the disturbed circadian rhythm but did not influence the size of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From these results, oxiracetam is thought to have a protective effect in cerebrovascular impairment </plain></SENT>
