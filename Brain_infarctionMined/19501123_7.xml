<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite its importance, there are few specific treatments for lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, probably due largely to a lack of animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model in a higher primate, the Macaque monkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was achieved by occluding the deep subcortical penetrating arteries with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> spheres of mean diameters around 50 microm, and the appropriateness of this model as a lacunar-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was verified by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed widespread <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> in the ipsilateral white matter (WM) of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> monkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed the expression of neurotrophins in the activated glial cells, and found that their expression of BDNF was stimulated in the affected WM following ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results support the idea that WM glial cells play an active role in protecting and promoting the regeneration of nerve fibers in the affected WM of the ischemic brain, by producing BDNF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings may be useful for the development of new therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing or treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
