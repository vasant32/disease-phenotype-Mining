<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>Hypoxia</z:mp> IN VITRO was modeled using oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) followed by reoxygenation of BV-2 microglial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that treatment of mice that have undergone CI/R injury with andrographolide (10-100 µg/kg, i. v.) at 1 h after <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> ameliorated CI/R-induced oxidative/nitrosative stress, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, and neurological deficits in the mice, and enhanced their survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CI/R induced a remarkable production in the mouse brains of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a significant increase in protein nitrosylation; this primarily resulted from enhanced expression of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase 2 (NOX2), inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS), and the infiltration of CD11b cells due to activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF- κB) and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1 α) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these changes were significantly diminished by andrographolide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In BV-2 cells, OGD induced ROS and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> production by upregulating NOX2 and iNOS via the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT-dependent NF- κB and HIF-1 α pathways, and these changes were suppressed by andrographolide and LY294002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that andrographolide reduces NOX2 and iNOS expression possibly by impairing PI3K/AKT-dependent NF- κB and HIF-1 α activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This compromises microglial activation, which then, in turn, mediates andrographolide's protective effect in the CI/R mice </plain></SENT>
