<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Particulate matter is increasingly recognized as a cause of human diseases, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the association between Asian dust (AD), a windblown sand dust originating from mineral soil in the deserts of China and Mongolia, and the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether AD is associated with the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study investigated the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> time of 7429 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> who were admitted to seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> centers in Fukuoka, Japan, between June 1999 and March 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Meteorologic variables and air pollutants, including AD and suspended particulate matters, were investigated during the identical period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A time-stratified case-crossover study was conducted to assess the association between AD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence using a conditional logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although AD was not significantly associated with the overall incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, there was a relationship specific to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AD was significantly associated with the incidence of atherothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> after adjusting for expected confounders, including meteorologic variables and other air pollutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No association was detected in other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggest that AD does not increase the overall incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, but it is specifically associated with the risk of atherothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
