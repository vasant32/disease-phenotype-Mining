<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the pharmacokinetics of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> in the brain is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, a method using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry coupled with microdialysis and an auto-blood sampling system was developed to determine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration in the brain and blood of gerbils subjected to treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (3.0 mg kg(-1), i.p.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed the limit of detection was 0.04 μg L(-1) and the correlation coefficient was 0.9997 for the determination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean parameters, maximum drug concentration (C(max)) and the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to time infinity (AUC(inf)), following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> administration were 1.06±0.28 μg L(-1) and 296.82±44.67 μg min L(-1), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The time to peak concentration (C(max) or T(max)) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> occurred at 105±17.10 min, and the mean elimination half-life (t(1/2)) from brain was 190.81±85.18 min after administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The brain <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels decreased to 71% of the basal levels in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>-treated group when compared with those in the control (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> decreased blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels to 80% at 1h after pretreatment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> significantly reduced the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume compared with that of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that this method may be useful for simultaneous and continuous determination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations in brain and plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> was effective at penetrating the blood-brain barrier as evidenced by the rapid appearance of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> in the brain, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> may contribute to a reduction in the extent of injuries related to cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> via its hypoglycemic effect </plain></SENT>
