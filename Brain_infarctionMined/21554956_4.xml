<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to develop a hypoxic-preconditioning (PC) model of ischemic tolerance in the newborn piglet, which emulates important clinical similarities to human situation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004045" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">birth asphyxia</z:e>, and to characterize some of the molecular mechanisms shown to be implicated in PC-induced neuroprotection in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent models</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One day old piglets were subjected to PC (8% O2/92% N2) for 3 h and 24 h later were exposed to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (HI) produced by a combination of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (5% FiO2) for a period of 30 min and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by a period of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (10 min of <z:mp ids='MP_0004876'>reduced mean arterial blood pressure</z:mp>; ≤70% of baseline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuropathologic analysis and unbiased stereology, conducted at 24 h, 3 and 7 days of recovery following HI, indicated a substantial reduction in the severity of brain damage in PC piglets compared to non-PC piglets (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PC significantly increased the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and its target gene, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) at 0 h, 6h, 24 h, 3 and 7 days of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that PC resulted in HIF-1α protein stabilization and accumulation in nuclear extracts of cerebral cortex of newborn piglet brain compared to normoxic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Protein levels of VEGF increased in a time-dependent manner in both cortex and hippocampus following PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Double-immunolabeling indicated that VEGF is mainly expressed in neurons, endothelial cells and astroglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrates for the first time the protective efficacy of PC against hypoxic-ischemic injury in newborn piglet model, which recapitulates many pathophysiological features of asphyxiated human neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, as has been shown in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent models</z:e> of preconditioning, our results suggest that PC-induced protection in neonatal piglets may involve upregulation of VEGF </plain></SENT>
