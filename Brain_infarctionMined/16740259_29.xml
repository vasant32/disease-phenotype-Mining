<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to compare 4 different methods of inducing focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with ET-1: (1) topical application to the forelimb motor region of the cortex, (2) intracerebral injection into the forelimb motor region of the cortex, (3) a combination of intracortical and intrastriatal injections and 4. injection of ET-1 adjacent to the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of delivery method and dose of ET-1 on lesion size, inter-animal variability and behavioral outcome on 3 separate tests of motor function and limb preference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We calculated success rate as the percentage of animals that survived surgery and developed a significant impairment (&gt;20% decrease in performance post-surgery) in the staircase-reaching test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 4 methods produced similar deficits in the staircase, balance beam, and cylinder tests, but the application of ET-1 adjacent to the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, though widely used, provided the lowest success rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The combined cortical and striatal ET-1 produced a high success rate and consequently we examined cerebral blood flow (CBF), the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes for this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume measured using T2-weighted MRI correlated with histological measurements and that <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and CBF together predicted which areas will suffer permanent injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combined cortical and striatal injection model offers a number of advantages for studies of recovery of function </plain></SENT>
