<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effects of cerebrovascular lesions on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> are not yet fully understood, whereas the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) is known to be associated with cerebrovascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the frequency of concomitant cerebrovascular pathologies in autopsy-proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> cases (n = 25) in comparison with AD cases (n= 63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also investigated the correlation between cerebrovascular pathologies and the clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On gross inspection, five cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> and seven cases of AD were complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> and the difference was significant; most of the lesions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hemorrhages</z:hpo>, possibly related to trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> and 25 cases of AD had grossly identified infarctions, but no significant difference was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> and four cases of AD had concomitant <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp>, while 10 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> and 43 cases of AD had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on microscopic inspection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in the frequency of microscopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> and AD, whereas no significant difference was noted in the frequency of microscopic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> cases without vascular complications, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory disturbance</z:e> was common as the initial symptom, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> was more common in those with vascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, no significant difference was observed between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> cases with and without vascular complications with respect to the frequency of individual clinical symptoms over the whole clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that grossly identified <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> are more common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> because of trauma, while microinfarcts are less common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> than AD, although the reason remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Such vascular complications might affect the clinical manifestations, in particular, the initial symptom, of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
