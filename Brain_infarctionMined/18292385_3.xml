<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Models of photochemically-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> are widely used in cerebrovascular research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Photothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> can be induced by systemic application of photosensitizing dyes followed by focal illumination of the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the ensuing activation of platelets is well established, their contribution for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and tissue damage has not formally been proved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Infarction to the cerebral cortex was induced in mice by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">Rose Bengal</z:chebi> and a cold light source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To assess the functional role of platelets, animals were platelet-depleted by anti-GPIbalpha antibodies or treated with GPIIb/IIIa-blocking F(ab)(2) fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The significance of the plasmatic coagulation cascade was determined by using blood coagulation factor XII (FXII)-deficient mice or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> development and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were determined by serial MRI and conventional and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no difference in development and final size of photothrombotic infarctions in mice with impaired platelet function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, deficiency of FXII, which initiates the intrinsic pathway of coagulation and is essential for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, or blockade of FXa, the key protease during the waterfall cascade of plasmatic coagulation, by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> likewise did not affect lesion development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that platelet activation, factor XII-driven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, and plasmatic coagulation pathways downstream of FX are not a prerequisite for ensuing tissue damage in models of photothrombotic vessel injury indicating that other pathomechanisms are involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We suggest that this widely used model does not depend on platelet- or plasmatic coagulation-derived <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
