<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether segmental left ventricular wall motion abnormalities (SLVWMA) are a potential cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Demographics, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and echocardiographic parameters of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (with and without SLVWMA) were collected and compared with those of patients who had SLVWMA but without history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were identified: 187 patients without SLVWMA, and 72 with SLVWMA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cardiac group consisted of 79 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with SLVWMA, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients without SLVWMA were slightly but significantly younger (59 versus 63 years of age) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the number of risk factors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients without SLVWMA was significantly lower compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with SLVWMA (2.7 versus 3.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in age or gender between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with SLVWMA and the cardiac patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the number of risk factors was significantly higher in the cardiac patients compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with SLVWMA (4.4 versus 3.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ejection fraction was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in both groups of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients but significantly lower in the cardiac patients (37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significantly more lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with SLVWMA than in those without SLVWMA (76% versus 68%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients with multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and SLVWMA a higher frequency of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> can be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The latter could be a marker of small-vessel disease and/or be a potential contributing factor, perhaps through a mechanism of cardiac microembolism, in the development of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of the association between SLVWMA and lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> remain however unclear </plain></SENT>
