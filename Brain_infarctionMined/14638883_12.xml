<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical and radiological features of patients presenting with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> auditory syndrome as a prodromal symptom of anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 16 consecutive cases of AICA infarction diagnosed by brain magnetic resonance imaging completed a standardised audiovestibular questionnaire and underwent a neuro-otological evaluation by an experienced neuro-otologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five patients (31%) had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> auditory syndrome as a prodrome of AICA infarction one to 10 days before <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of other brain stem or cerebellar symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> auditory syndrome were found: recurrent transient hearing loss with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> (n = 3), and a single episode of prolonged hearing loss with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The episodic symptoms were brief, lasting only minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> preceding the infarction was identical to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> experienced at the time of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the time of infarction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients developed hearing loss, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo>, and ipsilateral hemiataxia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most commonly affected site was the middle cerebellar peduncle (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four of the five patients had incomplete hearing loss and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had absence of vestibular function to caloric stimulation on the affected side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> auditory syndrome may be a warning sign of impending pontocerebellar infarction in the distribution of the AICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> auditory syndrome preceding an AICA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> may result from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> of the inner ear or the vestibulocochlear nerve </plain></SENT>
