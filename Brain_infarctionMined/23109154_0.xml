<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A study was undertaken to examine the relation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) pathology, cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and Lewy body (LB) pathology to cognition in persons without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Persons without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> from 2 cohort studies of aging, the Religious Orders Study and the Memory and Aging Project, agreed to annual clinical evaluation and brain donation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The studies had 19 neuropsychological performance tests in common that assessed 5 cognitive domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For 296 persons without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> who died and underwent postmortem assessment, we quantified AD pathology as a global pathology score, and as amyloid load, paired helical filament tau-positive (PHFtau) tangle density, cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and LB pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linear regression was used to examine the relation of neuropathology to cognitive abilities, controlling for demographics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> persons had AD pathology with &gt;Â¾ exhibiting amyloid; 22% had macroscopic and 24% had microscopic infarctions, and 13% had LB pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The global measure of AD pathology was related to global cognition (p = 0.008), whereas <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Amyloid load was related to global cognition (p &lt; 0.05), with only a trend for tangles (p = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In analyses of cognitive domains, AD pathology (p = 0.006), PHFtau tangles (p = 0.03), and macroscopic infarctions (p = 0.02) were related to episodic memory, with a trend for amyloid load (p = 0.06); AD pathology (p = 0.02) and amyloid load (p = 0.03) were related to working memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Findings for global cognition and episodic memory were stronger in additional analyses with neocortical amyloid and mesial temporal tangles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: AD pathology and macroscopic infarctions are common in older persons without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and are related to episodic and working memory </plain></SENT>
