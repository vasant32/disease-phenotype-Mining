<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It appeared that within 4 days, at least 76% (95% confidence interval 39-100%) of 21 cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> had become hemorrhagic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conclude that if anticoagulation is considered in cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, such treatment should not be started sooner than at least 4 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, provided that computed tomography at that time shows no hemorrhagic infarction </plain></SENT>
