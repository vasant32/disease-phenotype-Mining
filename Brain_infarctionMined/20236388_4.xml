<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infection</z:e> of primary neurons with an adenovirus expressing <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (WT) COX-2 increased the susceptibility of neurons to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infection</z:e> with an adenoviral vector expressing COX-2 with a mutation at the cyclooxygenase site did not increase susceptibility to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, whereas over-expression of COX-2 with a mutation in the peroxidase site produced similar susceptibility to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> as WT COX-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary neuronal cultures obtained from transgenic mice bearing a mutation in the COX-2 cylooxygenase site were protected from <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice with a mutation in the cyclooxygenase site had smaller infarctions 24 h after 70 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> than WT control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>COX-2 activity had no effect on the formation of protein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyls</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="22651">Ascorbate</z:chebi> radicals were detected by electron paramagnetic resonance as a product of recombinant COX-2 activity and were blocked by COX-2 inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, formation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22651">ascorbate</z:chebi> radicals was inhibited in the presence of COX-2 inhibitors and in homogenates obtained from COX-2 null mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results indicate that the cyclooxygenase activity of COX-2 is necessary to exacerbate neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> injury rather than the peroxidase activity of the enzyme </plain></SENT>
