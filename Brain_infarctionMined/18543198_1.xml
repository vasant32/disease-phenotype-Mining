<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It generally involves a full 180 degrees rotation of the visual field in the coronal plane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its chief causation is vertebrobasilar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, although the phenomenon has also been linked to many other conditions, such as multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> or traumatic head and neck injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some notable features of reversal of vision metamorphopsia are the wide topographic variety of the lesions responsible for the condition, the transient nature of the symptom and its improvement or resolution in the presence of certain stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 35-year-old male with a sudden episode of instability that prevented him from walking, together with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> and reversal of vision metamorphopsia that lasted for an hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A magnetic resonance scan enabled us to identify an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar lesion</z:e> as the cause of the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The variety of locations of the lesions that give rise to reversal of vision metamorphopsia would be mainly due to the multisensory nature of the neurons in the posterior parietal cortex, the area of the brain where the visuospatial integration of images is performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These neurons receive visual, proprioceptive and vestibular afferences, which means that any lesions that occur in these three systems or in the central integrator itself could cause the phenomenon of reversal of vision metamorphopsia </plain></SENT>
