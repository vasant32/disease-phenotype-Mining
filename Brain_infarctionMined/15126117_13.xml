<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is involved in many TGFbeta-mediated responses, we examined the interaction of BMP7 and MAPK in primary cultures obtained from the cerebral cortex of E16-17 rat embryos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">Lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) in the media was used as an index of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BMP7 did not alter LDH levels at low concentration (1.25 nM), but exhibited increased cellular toxicity at higher concentration (&gt;12.5 nM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BMP7 at the low concentration significantly attenuated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi>-induced increases in LDH activity and decreases in neuronal density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological interactions were used to examine if MAPK was involved in this response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BMP7-induced protection was antagonized by the p42,44 MAPK kinase inhibitors PD98059 and U0125 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The p38 MAPK <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> SB203580, and their inactive analog SB202474, also attenuated BMP7-induced protection, suggesting that the interaction with p38 MAPK is nonspecific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have indicated that SB202474 has inhibitory effects on other protein kinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37700">protein kinase C inhibitor</z:chebi> chelerythrine antagonized BMP7-induced protection against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis indicated that BMP7 increased phosphorylation of p42,44 MAPK and PKC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our data suggest that BMP7 is neuroprotective at low concentrations in primary cortical cell culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The protective effects of BMP7 may involve the activation of p42,44 MAPK and PKC </plain></SENT>
