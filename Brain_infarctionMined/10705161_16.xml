<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>VaD patients with small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes had a similar degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> to those with larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes (&gt;15 ml) but were significantly more likely to be depressed and to have areas of microinfarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A review of individual cases with small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes suggested that the combination of microinfarction, diffuse white matter disease and perivascular changes, or the overlap of neurodegenerative pathologies and microvascular changes were particularly important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microinfarction was also significantly associated with major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
