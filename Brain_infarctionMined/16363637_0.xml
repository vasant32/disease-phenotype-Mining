<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined lower limb muscle responses after stimulation of the sural nerve in 19 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> caused by cerebro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> and compared them with the control responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sural nerve was stimulated electrically (3 or 5 square wave pulses of 0.5 ms repeated at 250 Hz) during weak tonic contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stimulation was triggered to average the rectified surface electromyography (EMG) of the test muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Usually 100 - 200 sweeps were averaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After stimulation, the tibialis anterior muscle on the affected side of the hemiplegic patients showed the patterns of inhibition, facilitation, and no response, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> responses on the unaffected side, except those of one patient, were inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The peroneal muscle on both sides showed only facilitation as in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Abnormal responses of the tibialis anterior muscle on the affected side were present in many patients who had the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003487'>Babinski sign</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Abnormal responses in the tibialis anterior muscle of the affected side may have been due to contributions by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000734'>disinhibition</z:hpo> of the flexor reflex, late-recruited motor units or both </plain></SENT>
