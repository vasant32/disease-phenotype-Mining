<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The representation elicited in the cingulate motor area has been demonstrated in animals, but remains unclear in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, the representation and pathogenic mechanisms of the posterior cingulate cortex are poorly understood, especially in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a case of posterior cingulate infarction associated with contralateral astasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: A 67-year-old right-handed man with a 10-year history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> suddenly presented with right-sided pulsion on attempting to stand or sit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the following day, he could not maintain a sitting position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient immediately fell to the floor because of instability, characterized by marked right-sided pulsion despite no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo>, sensorial deficits, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resolution imaging of the brain showed abnormal intensity in the posterior parts of the cingulate, with no other clinically significant lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Because the cingulate motor area is connected to the vestibulocerebellar system through the thalamic nuclei, disruption of this connection by posterior cingulate infarction may result in astasia </plain></SENT>
