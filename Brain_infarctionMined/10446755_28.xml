<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The migration of neutrophils elicited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine</z:chebi>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor, C5a or platelet-activating factor was potently inhibited by fasudil, an inhibitor of protein kinases including rho kinase, protein kinase C and myosin light chain kinase, and hydroxy fasudil, a metabolite of fasudil, in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a microembolism model in rats, myeloperoxidase-quantified neutrophil accumulation in the ischemic brain was observed 24 hr after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intravenous administration of fasudil prevented the accumulation of neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In rats given fasudil, myeloperoxidase activity in the ipsilateral hemisphere (0.04+/-0.01 unit/g wet tissue) was significantly lower than that in ischemic rats (0.11+/-0.02 unit/g wet tissue) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasudil also significantly reduced the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and improved neurological functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that neutrophil infiltration into the ischemic brain is involved in the pathogenesis of ischemic injury and that inhibiting neutrophil infiltration may provide an effective therapeutic intervention to reduce ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
