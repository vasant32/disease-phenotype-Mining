<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We produced rat models of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and examined <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume as well as immunohistochemical localization and protein expression levels of cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)), which is involved in neurotoxicity, in brains obtained 24 h after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats pretreated for 7 days with various doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> or vehicle (n = 8) were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was significantly reduced in the 1.0 mg/kg dosage group compared with that of other dosage groups and vehicle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> 1.0 mg/kg induced significant amelioration of sensorimotor function in forelimb and hindlimb placing tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histopathologically, neurons in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cortical regions of vehicle-pretreated rats showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic changes, but neurons in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi>-pretreated rats appeared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, cPLA(2) reactivity was localized in ischemic neurons but not in intact neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On immunoblots, protein expression levels of total and active cPLA(2) in peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cortex were significantly reduced in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi>-treated rats compared with vehicle-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present results provide in vivo evidence that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> reduces cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and cPLA(2) protein expression in peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cortex, suggesting an association between neuroprotection and inhibition of cPLA(2) signaling in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
