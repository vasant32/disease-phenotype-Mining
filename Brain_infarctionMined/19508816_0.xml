<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and twenty four patients with 12 hour window <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> were examined by fast multimode MRI, and among them, 46 patients with hyperacute <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> confirmed by fast multimode MRI were treated by recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and followed up periodically by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 46 patients selected by fast multimode MRI to receive thrombolytics demonstrated clinical improvement with 90 days modified Rankin scale scores &lt; or =2 and life quality Barthal index of 80-100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six patients developed asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (13.0%) 1-7 days after receiving thrombolytics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients suffering from hyperacute <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262005" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemic cerebral infarction</z:e> that are strong candidates for intravenous thrombolytic therapy can be identified by multimode MRI, especially for those whose time windows were undefined or beyond 3 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fast multimodal MRI based selection of the hyperacute <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model is more feasible compared with the traditional diffusion weighted imaging/perfusion weighted imaging mismatch model for the emergency assessment of hyperacute <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
