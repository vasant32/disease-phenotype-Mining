<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we studied 30-day case fatality, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> location in first and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, accounting for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional follow-up of 998 patients with first cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> registered in a hospital-based <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a follow-up of 691 +/- 521 (SD) days, there were 138 (13.8%) first recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, 84 (61%) of which had computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was of the same subtype as the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 27 (57%) of 339 lacunar, 38 (83%) of 435 atherothrombotic, and 33 (94%) of 224 cardioembolic cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The annual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence rate was about 7% for the whole group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis showed lacunar first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> as independent predictors for recurrent lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and atherothrombotic first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> type for recurrent atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> recurrences that were of the same type as the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred in the same brain area as the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 70% of lacunar and 79% of atherothrombotic cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was more frequent when compared with nonsimilar recurrence types: odds ratio (OR) 4.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-15.79; and OR 5.63, 95% CI 1.38-22.92, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 33% of cardioembolic recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred in the same area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 30-day case fatality in index and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was, respectively, 2% and 14% (OR 7.90, 95% CI 2.78-22.48) for lacunar, 10% and 26% (OR 3.27, 95% CI 1.62-6.60) for atherothrombotic, and 23% and 31% (OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.55-3.93) for cardioembolic index <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The annual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence rate after a first brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> is about 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Early case fatality after recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is higher than after first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, with marked differences between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Progression of small and large vessel disease, and the brain area of their location, are rather homogeneous over time </plain></SENT>
