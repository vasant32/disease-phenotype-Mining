<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular involvement is a common, poorly studied, and potentially modifiable pathologic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that imaging patterns of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> are recognizable in neonatal group B streptococcal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A consecutive case series included term neonates with the following: (1) <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, (2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> group B <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">streptococcal infection</z:e> (positive cerebrospinal fluid/blood culture), (3) brain magnetic resonance imaging within 14 days, and (4) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intraparenchymal focal infarctions (restricted diffusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lesions within known arterial territories were classified as arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical presentations, investigations, and neurologic outcomes were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight newborns (50% female) with focal infarction were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five presented early (&lt;1 week), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> manifested clinical shock and elevated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase reactants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Less than 50% had prenatal group B streptococcal screening, while 2 of 3 screened were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two distinct patterns of focal infarction were identified: (1) deep perforator arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to basal ganglia, thalamus, and periventricular white matter (7/8, 88%), and (2) superficial injury with patchy, focal infarctions of the cortical surface (6/8, 75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Outcomes (mean 23.8 months) were poor, with severe disability or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 6/8 (75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Recognizable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patterns contribute to severe neurologic outcomes and represent a potentially modifiable pathophysiologic process in neonatal group B streptococcal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
