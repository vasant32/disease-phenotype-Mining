<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma (PPARgamma) are nuclear receptors with essential roles as transcriptional regulators of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PPARgamma are also potent anti-inflammatory receptors, a property that contributes to the neuroprotective effects of PPARgamma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of these beneficial actions, however, is not fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have explored further the actions of the PPARgamma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induced by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> induced brain 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) expression in ischemic rat brain, concomitantly with neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> also increased cerebral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6497">lipoxin</z:chebi> A(4) (LXA(4)) levels and inhibited MCAO-induced production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">leukotriene B4</z:chebi> (LTB(4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition and/or genetic deletion of 5-LO inhibited <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>-induced neuroprotection and downregulation of inflammatory gene expression, LXA(4) synthesis and PPARgamma transcriptional activity in rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, LXA(4) caused neuroprotection, which was partly inhibited by the PPARgamma <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> T0070907, and increased PPARgamma transcriptional activity in isolated nuclei, showing for the first time that LXA(4) has PPARgamma agonistic actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Altogether, our data illustrate that some effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> are attributable to de novo synthesis of 5-LO, able to induce a switch from the synthesis of proinflammatory LTB(4) to the synthesis of the proresolving LXA(4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests novel lines of study such as the interest of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6497">lipoxin</z:chebi>-like <z:chebi fb="3" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> or the use of these molecules as prognostic and/or diagnostic markers for pathologies in which <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is involved, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
