<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Applying the candidate gene approach, we screened the 5'-flanking region and the entire coding region of the CTSG gene for genetic variation by using polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis from 96 patients at high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified 4 polymorphisms in the 5'-flanking region (G-618C, G-315A, C-179T, and C-160T) and 1 polymorphism in the coding region (Asn125Ser) of the gene and genotyped the participants in the Etude Cas-Temoins sur l'Infarctus <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">du</z:e> Myocarde (ECTIM Study), a case-control study for MI, and in the Etude <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">du</z:e> Profil Génétique de l'Infarctus Cérébral (GENIC Study), a case-control study for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (BI), for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> identified genetic variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The potential in vitro functionality of the 4 variants in the 5'-flanking region was investigated with transient transfection analyses in U937 cells with different allelic promoter constructs by using a luciferase assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our in vitro analyses did not reveal any differences for the investigated allelic constructs with respect to promoter activity, and none of the polymorphisms in the 5'-flanking region was associated with the available phenotypes in either study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Allele and genotype distributions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> identified polymorphisms did not globally differ between cases and controls in the ECTIM Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in patients from the ECTIM Study, the Ser125 allele was significantly associated with elevated plasma fibrinogen levels (P=0.006), but this effect was not seen in controls (case-control <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant interaction between CTSG Asn125Ser and the beta-fibrinogen gene polymorphism G-455A on plasma fibrinogen levels (P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the GENIC Study, the odds ratio for BI associated with CTSG Ser125 carrying was 1.82 (95% CI 1.16 to 2.84, P=0.008) in patients without a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the CTSG Ser125 allele is associated with plasma fibrinogen levels in MI patients from the ECTIM Study and with BI in the GENIC Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies should be carried out to define the underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
