<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Details of the structural changes that develop in either the human or the rat brain at various times after occlusion of an intracranial artery are incompletely characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied, in 48 adult Wistar rats, structural alterations involving the cerebral hemisphere ipsilateral to an <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp>, at intervals ranging from 30 min to 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microscopic changes developed over time in separate areas of the corresponding cerebral hemisphere in a predictable pattern, appearing as small lesions in the preoptic area (30 minutes), enlarging to involve the striatum, and finally involving the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two types of neuronal responses were noted according to the time elapsed; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> changes (up to 6 hours) included scalloping, shrinkage, and swelling, whereas delayed changes (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> and karyolysis) appeared later (&gt; or = 12 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three types of astrocytic responses were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>1) Cytoplasmic disintegration occurred in the preoptic area at a time and in a place where neurons appeared minimally injured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>2) Nuclear and cytoplasmic swelling were prominent responses in the caudoputamen and cerebral cortex at a time when neurons showed minimal alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>3) Increased astrocytic glial fibrillary acidic protein reactivity was noted at the interface between the lesion and the surrounding brain tissue after 4 to 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The gross pattern of the brain lesion and the maturation of neuronal changes typical of a brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> have a predictable progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> of up to 6-hour duration does not induce coagulation <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
