<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both effects of localization (anterior vs. posterior lobe) and side (left vs. right cerebellar hemisphere) were of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients with infarctions within the territory of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) and seven patients with infarctions within the territory of the superior cerebellar artery (SCA) participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The affected lobules and nuclei were assessed based on 3D <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The right cerebellar hemisphere was affected in eight PICA and two SCA patients, the left hemisphere in six PICA and four SCA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One SCA patient revealed a bilateral lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In order to study possible lateralization of functions, subjects performed a language task as well as standard neglect and extinction tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, two tests of executive functions were applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant group differences apart from a verbal fluency task, in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cerebellar patients - but especially those with right-sided lesions - were impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) revealed that a lesion of the right hemispheric lobule Crus II was associated with impaired performance in the verbal fluency task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In sum, the results showed preserved cognitive abilities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cerebellar patients apart from impairments of verbal fluency in patients with right-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The latter findings are in line with the assumption that the right posterolateral cerebellar hemisphere supports functions associated with verbal fluency </plain></SENT>
