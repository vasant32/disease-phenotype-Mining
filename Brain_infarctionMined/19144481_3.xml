<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the clinical outcome obtained in the treatment of dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> (DAVFs) using a new liquid embolic agent, Onyx-18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The present series included 21 patients; 9 had DAVFs draining directly into the cortical veins, 6 had DAVFs draining directly into the dural sinus, 4 had DAVFs draining through the ophthalmic veins and 2 had DAVFs involving the dural sinus with leptomeningeal retrograde venous drainage Clinical data were extracted from hospital files and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 14 patients (70%) there was complete angiographic elimination of the shunts and resolution of the symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining 7(30%) patients was not cured with residual shunts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adverse events occurred in 6(30%) of 21 patients with 1 DAVF located at the transverse sigmoid sinus, 2 at tentorium, and 3 at the cavernous sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cranial deficits occurred in 3(15%) patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in 1(5%) patient and microcatheter gluing in 1(3.2%) patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At final follow up, 20 patients were asymptomatic with 1 showed clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Definitive cure may be attained effectively with Onyx in dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> and adjunctive to surgery and radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Location of the DAVFs affected the outcome of transarterial embolization </plain></SENT>
