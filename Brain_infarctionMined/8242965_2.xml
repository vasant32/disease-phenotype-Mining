<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report on four patients with hemodynamic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and pathological circadian blood pressure patterns with nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> which gave rise to a prolonged disturbance of the blood-brain barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Besides at least one severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery, there was an untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and a pathologically reduced vasomotor reactivity after <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> stimulation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 24-h blood pressure monitoring then carried out showed a distinctly pathological circadian profile with hypertensive day values and nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> with minimum values of 95/50 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The range of variation between day and night values was significantly raised (systolic: 20% +/- 2.15%; diastolic: 22.9% +/- 2.58%) compared to patients with essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> as well as normotensive subjects (P &lt; 0.01), and was in excess of 40% in the individual case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a slow recovery of the blood-brain barrier after drug-induced normalization of the pathological circadian blood pressure profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the registration of circadian blood pressure patterns may be of prognostic and therapeutic relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It may also contribute to further clarification of the pathophysiological significance of blood pressure variability for the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
