<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ethyl <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> (EP), a simple aliphatic <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32816">pyruvic acid</z:chebi>, has been shown to act as an anti-inflammatory molecule in various pathological conditions, which include <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> or hemorrhagic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we showed that ethyl <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> has a neuroprotective effect in the postischemic brain and also in KA-induced pathogenesis in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined whether aspirin augments neuroprotective effect of ethyl <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> in transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model by complementing the neuroprotective effects of ethyl <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although, most of neuroprotective effect of aspirin has been attributed to the anti-platelet action, aspirin also has direct neuroprotective effects, including NF-kappaB inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ethyl <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> dose-dependently suppressed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> formation in the postischemic brain, wherein intravenous administration of 5 mg/kg ethyl <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> 30 min after the occlusion reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume to 34.5 +/- 15.5% (n = 6, P &lt; 0.01) of that of the untreated control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In combination with aspirin (5 mg/kg, i.v.), the neuroprotective effect was enhanced, resulting in 16.0 +/- 5.9% (n = 6, P &lt; 0.01) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The time window for synergistic neuroprotection by ethyl <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> and aspirin extended to 9 h post-MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The synergistic reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was accompanied by suppression of the clinical manifestations associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> including motor impairment and neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory processes including microglial activation and proinflammatory cytokine expression were notably suppressed by the combination treatment in the postischemic brain and in primary microglia cultures, wherein ethyl <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> and aspirin modulate NF-kappaB signaling differentially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aspirin interferes with IkappaB phosphorylation and degradation in the cytoplasm, possibly by specifically inhibiting IkappaB kinase-beta, whereas, the effect of ethyl <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> seems to occur in the nucleus, where it may interfere with the binding of NF-kappaB to responsive promoter elements in the target genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similar enhancement in neuroprotective effect was also observed in primary cortical cultures after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> or Zn(2+) treatment or oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Together, these results indicate that combination treatment of ethyl <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> and aspirin affords synergistic neuroprotection in the postischemic brain with a wide therapeutic window, in part via differential modulation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
