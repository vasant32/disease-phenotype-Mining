<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study investigates the anti-oxidative effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4093">D-allose</z:chebi> on ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 1 h under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4093">D-allose</z:chebi> was intravenously infused during occlusion and a further 1 h after reperfusion (400 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4093">D-allose</z:chebi> on focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> were examined by measuring brain damage (infarction and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> volume) and behavioral deficits 7 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In another set of rats, apurnic/apyrimidic abasic sites (AP-sites) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> markers, were investigated 24 h after MCAO to examine the anti-oxidative effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4093">D-allose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain damage and behavioral deficits were significantly decreased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4093">D-allose</z:chebi> administration compared to vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of AP-sites and 8-OHdG levels were also reduced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4093">D-allose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the present study suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4093">D-allose</z:chebi> has anti-oxidative effects and induces neuroprotection in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
