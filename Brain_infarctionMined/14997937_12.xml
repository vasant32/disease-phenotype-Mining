<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present investigation, we assessed the functional role of transforming growth factor (TGF)beta2 in vitro and studied TGFbeta-2mRNA and protein expression in two <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> lesion paradigms in vivo characterized by fundamental differences in microglia/macrophage behaviour: optic nerve crush exhibiting slow, and focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> exhibiting rapid phagocytic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we used sciatic nerve crush injury as a PNS lesion paradigm comparable to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> in its rapid phagocyte response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and degenerating optic nerves, astrocytes strongly and continuously expressed TGF-beta2 immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, TGF-beta2 was downregulated in Schwann cells of degenerating sciatic nerves, and was not expressed by reactive astrocytes in the vicinity of focal ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phagocytic phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In line with its differential lesion-associated expression pattern, exogenous TGF-beta2 suppressed spontaneous myelin phagocytosis by microglia/macrophages in a mouse ex vivo assay of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> and PNS Wallerian degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have identified TGF-beta2 as a <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system intrinsic cytokine that could account for the differential regulation of phagocytic activities of microglia and macrophages during injury </plain></SENT>
