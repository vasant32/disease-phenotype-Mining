<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An approach combining reperfusion mediated by thrombolytics with pharmacological neuroprotection aimed at inhibiting the physiopathological disorders responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion damage, could provide an optimal treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigate, in a rat embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model, the combination of rtPA with citicoline as compared to either alone as monotherapy, and whether the neuroprotector should be provided before or after thrombolysis to achieve a greater reduction of ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred and nine rats have been studied: four were sham-operated and the rest embolized in the right internal carotid artery with an autologous clot and divided among 5 groups: 1) control; 2) iv rtPA 5 mg/kg 30 min post-embolization 3) citicoline 250 mg/kg ip x3 doses, 10 min, 24 h and 48 h post-embolization; 4) citicoline combined with rtPA following the same pattern; 5) rtPA combined with citicoline, with a first dose 10 min after thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mortality, neurological score, volume of ischemic lesion and neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (TUNEL) after 72 h and plasma levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha, were considered to assess ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with controls, the use of citicoline after thrombolysis produced the greatest reduction of mortality caused by the ischemic lesion (p&lt;0.01), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (p=0.027), number of TUNEL positive cells in striatum (p=0.014) and plasma levels of TNF-alpha at 3 h (p=0.027) and 72 h (p=0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>rtPA induced reperfusion provided a slight non-significant reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, but it reduced mortality due to brain damage (p&lt;0.01) although an increase in the risk of fatal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CiT as monotherapy only produced a significant reduction of neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in striatum (p=0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combination of CiT before rtPA did not add any benefit to rtPA alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The superiority of the combined treatment with rtPA followed by citicoline suggests that early reperfusion should be followed by effective neuroprotection to inhibit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury and better protect the tissue at risk </plain></SENT>
