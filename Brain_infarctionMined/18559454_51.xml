<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A major pathway for Ca(2+) entry in nonexcitable cells involves receptor-mediated release of intracellular Ca(2+) stores, followed by activation of store-operated calcium (SOC) channels in the plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) has been identified as the Ca(2+) sensor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that activates Ca(2+) release-activated channels in T cells, but its role in mammalian <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Platelets express high levels of STIM1, but its exact function has been elusive, because these cells lack a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ER and Ca(2+) is stored in a tubular system referred to as the sarcoplasmatic reticulum </plain></SENT>
