<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pathogenesis of leukoaraiosis is incompletely understood and accumulation of small infarctions may be one of the possible sources of such white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, the purpose of this study was to identify the rate of incident infarction as depicted on diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) obtained from a general patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the 4-year study period, a total of 60 patients (36 men and 24 women) had an incidental DWI-defined infarction without overt clinical symptoms suggestive of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were obtained by using a similar protocol on 2 identical 1.5T whole-body scanners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient's vascular risk factors, as well as the presence of white matter lesions (WMLs) on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and atheromatous changes on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography, were assessed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidental DWI-defined <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were also characterized in terms of their lateralization, lobe, and specific location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 16,206 consecutive brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were done during the study period; the overall incidence of incidental <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was 0.37% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most of these patients with an incidental <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> had vascular risk factors and WMLs on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most of these patients (80%) had a single lesion on DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 88 lesions were identified; most were located in the white matter of the supratentorial brain, primarily in the frontoparietal lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were also lesions involving the brain stem (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The lesions involving cerebrum were more commonly located in the right side (right to left = 52:34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Small, DWI-defined <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> can be found incidentally in an asymptomatic population; this finding may account, at least in part, for the pathogenesis of WMLs identified on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
