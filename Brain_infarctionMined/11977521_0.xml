<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunohistochemical technique and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin stain was used to show the changes of the expression of GAP-43 and pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In infarction group, GAP-43 expression was markedly increased on the infarction and surrounding tissues at 24 h <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression reached peak level at 72 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and was decreased at 7 d after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in batroxobin-treated group, GAP-43 expression was increased and the pathological changes were much slight as compared with infarction group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The expression of GAP-43 increases in infarction of temporal neocortex and batroxobin promotes the expression of GAP-43 and ameliorates the pathological changes in infarction of temporal neocortex </plain></SENT>
