<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From our prospective registry of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, during a 4-year period, we've identified 121 consecutive patients with a CI (15.1% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They have been followed up for 1 year and we have registered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence, cardiovascular events and other incidences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age 70.6 years-old, 53% male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was the most often involved territory (52 cases), 70% of them with cortical involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No patient died during admission, 95.8% received antiplatelet therapy and 4.1% oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients were lost of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During 1-year period, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) was detected in 7 patients (6.54%), their mean age was 75 years-old, in 5 of them the CI was in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory (4 with cortical involvement, 1 only deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients (2.76%) suffered a recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, in weeks 15, 16 and 44 after the CI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 cases the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was considered cryptogenic again </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients suffered a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and 4 died during follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our series rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence and cardiovascular events after a CI was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An 11% of patients with a CI involving cortical <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory developed FA during the following year </plain></SENT>
