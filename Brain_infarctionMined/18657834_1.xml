<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Deep-brain lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> represents a significant clinical problem as it produces severe symptoms highly resistant to rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The limited area of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> may facilitate neurorepair via the action of various novel neuroprotective strategies including cell-based therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lesion was induced by stereotactic injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi> into adult rat brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequent behavioral testing involved beam walking task, rotarod, visual discrimination task and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="48538">apomorphine</z:chebi> rotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For morphological and topographical analysis brain slices were stained with H-E and evaluated under light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lesion size was measured in absolute terms and in relation to the whole brain volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis for the co-localization of BrdU with specific cell-type markers (PSA-NCAM, NG2, beta-tubulin III, GFAP, ED1) have has been performed, to determine the fate of newly generated cells with emphasis on evidence of neurogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lesion involved the basal ganglia, basal forebrain nuclei, internal capsule and striatum (just 1-2% of total brain volume) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant and relatively stable behavioral deficits were observed up to 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, large numbers of cells are seen to be newly generated in response to injury with a significant proportion of these being present on account of neurogenesis </plain></SENT>
