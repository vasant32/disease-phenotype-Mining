<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The presence of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (SBI) increases the risk of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The association between SBI and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> (CKD) has not been clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, little is known about what factors are related to SBI in CKD patients and whether the prevalence of SBI differs in CKD stage or cause of CKD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 375 subjects-335 with CKD and 40 with essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>-were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to detect SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated using Modification of Diet in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Renal Disease</z:e> equation, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of SBI was 56.5% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among causes of CKD, hypertensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0009741'>nephrosclerosis</z:hpo> had a strong association with SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>According to the estimated GFR (eGFR) stage, the more severe the stage of eGFR, the higher the prevalence of SBI (age-adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval] for eGFR 30-59, 15-29 and &lt;15 versus &gt;or=60 mL/min/1.73 m(2): 1.34 [0.68-1.99], 1.94 [1.30-2.57] and 2.51 [1.91-3.10]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In multivariate logistic analysis, eGFR was related to SBI independently, in addition to age and blood pressure (P = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, other traditional and non-traditional risk factors were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was an independent association between eGFR and SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CKD patients should receive active detection of SBI and more intensive preventive management, especially for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, should be needed in CKD patients to prevent SBI </plain></SENT>
