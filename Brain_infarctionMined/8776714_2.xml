<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the possible role of excitatory amino acids (EAAs) and cysteine in the development of brain damage after <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (HI) in neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a rat model of neonatal HI, changes in extracellular (ec) amino acids in cerebral cortex were measured with microdialysis and correlated with the extent of brain damage at the site of probe placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Extracellular concentrations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> and cysteine increased during HI and remained elevated during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During HI the pattern of EAA changes was the same in the infarcted, undamaged and border zone regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During reperfusion, however, the ec concentrations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> and cysteine were higher in infarcted and border zone areas compared to undamaged tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HI also produced a slight increase of tissue concentration of cysteine and decrease of tissue concentration of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> in parietal cortex of the HI hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of cysteine on brain damage induced by HI and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A subtoxic dose of cysteine potentiated <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> toxicity in the arcuate nucleus and enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> after HI in neonatal rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results show that in neonatal HI the extracellular levels of EAAs during HI are not directly related to brain injury but the EAA levels during reflow predict the extent of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cysteine increases HI-induced brain injury and potentiates <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> toxicity in neonatal rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Speculatively, elevated level of cysteine during reperfusion may participate in the excitotoxic cascade leading to brain injury </plain></SENT>
