<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We took sequential samples of cerebrospinal fluid from 28 patients within 48 hours, at 7 days, and at 18-21 days after the ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured astroglial protein concentrations using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and also determined size of the infarction (computed tomography), clinical state of the patient (simplified activities of daily living test), blood-brain barrier dysfunction (cerebrospinal fluid/serum albumin ratio), and a myelin marker (myelin basic protein) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found a transient increase of both proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid during the first week after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This increment was significantly correlated with the size of the infarction and the clinical state of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transient release of astroglial proteins into the cerebrospinal fluid possibly reflects initial focal ischemic damage and, in the later phase, ongoing destruction of astroglial cells in the penumbra zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suggest that determinations of cerebrospinal fluid astroglial protein concentrations can be used to estimate ischemic brain damage, which should be of particular value in clinical trials of pharmacological agents, such as calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
