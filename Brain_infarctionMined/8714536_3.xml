<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The successful application of thrombolytic therapy to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> has prompted a reinvestigation of thrombolytic therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, an examination of safety and efficacy of thrombolytic therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> has precluded the entry of patients taking either antiplatelet or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was therefore of interest, in an established rabbit model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo>, to examine the use of tissue plasminogen activator therapy in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> administration (10 mg kg-1, i.v., daily for 5 days), rabbits (n = 7) were embolized by injecting a tin-laden clot into the internal carotid artery with clot placement confirmed by x-ray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three hours later, t-PA was initiated as a square-wave pulse (6.3 mg kg-1 total dose, given as a 20% bolus, with the remainder administered over 2 h as a continuous infusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The protocol was continued for a total of 7 h following embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete clot lysis was demonstrated in 6 of 7 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining) was 36.0 +/- 12.9% hemisphere (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both clot lysis rate and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size were very similar to that previously seen following administration of t-PA alone (58% and 31.6 +/- 6.4% hemisphere, respectively) but in marked contrast to previous results seen with intravenous aspirin (no clot lysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that antiplatelet agents used clinically for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prophylaxis (aspirin or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi>) may influence the success rate of thrombolysis following initiation of thrombolytic therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
