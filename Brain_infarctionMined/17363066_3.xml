<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, 75% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases result from a thromboembolic event and 10% from occlusive atherothrombosis in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we characterize a mouse model of repeated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo>, which closely mimics the intravascular pathophysiology of arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> generation from an atherosclerotic plaque, and subsequent release of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> into the cerebral circulation as an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Common carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CCAT) was induced photochemically leading to non-occlusive platelet aggregation in C57/BL6 male mice (n=35), and was followed by mechanical assistance to facilitate release of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> (MRT) and thus promote embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six experimental groups, differing by changes in the surgical protocol, were used for the purpose of determining which such procedure yielded the most reliable and consistent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes with the lowest mortality at 3 days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The group which best satisfied these conditions was a double insult group which consisted of animals that underwent CCAT for 2 min by means of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> laser irradiation (514.5 nm) at an intensity of ca </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>130 W/cm(2), with concomitant injection of erythrosin B (EB) (35 mg/kg infused over those same 2 min), followed by MRT 1 min later; the entire procedure was repeated 24h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This group showed a percent of brain lesion volume of 15+/-4% (mean+/-S.D.) with no associated 3-day mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared to a single insult group which sustained a percent brain lesion volume of 7+/-3%, there was a statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) increase in the volume of infarction in the double-insult group </plain></SENT>
