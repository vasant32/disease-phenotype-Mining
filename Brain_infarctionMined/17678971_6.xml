<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">Estrogens</z:chebi> interact with intracellular receptors (ERalpha and ERbeta) to modulate the transcription of target genes, including those implicated in neuronal survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotection may also occur via interaction with ER-like membrane receptors mediating rapid, non-genomic, actions or via receptor-independent mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is also evidence that blockade of inflammatory factors may represent an important mechanism involved in estrogenic neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we investigate whether reduced brain damage by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> pharmacological treatment with 17beta-E(2) in male rats subjected to transient (2h) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAo) involves modulation of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), a proinflammatory cytokine strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Administration of 17beta-E(2) (0.2mg/kg, i.p., 1h before tMCAo) results in significant reduction of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and this is reverted by the ER <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> ICI 182,780 (0.25mg/kg, i.p.) administered 1h before 17beta-E(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two hours MCAo followed by 2-h reperfusion results in a significant, threefold increase of IL-1beta levels in the cortical tissue ipsilateral to the ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a pretreatment with a neuroprotective dose of 17beta-E(2) attenuates the cytokine elevation and this appears to occur through ER activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, neuroprotection by 17beta-E(2) is accompanied by reduced <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> translocation both in the striatum and in the cortex as revealed by Western blotting 3h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we report the original observation that neuroprotection exerted by 17beta-E(2) in a rat model of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> is accompanied by reduced <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> translocation to the cytosol and involves early modulation of IL-1beta production </plain></SENT>
