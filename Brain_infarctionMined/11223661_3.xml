<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate BP changes throughout a 24-hour period in lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patients with different outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve control subjects (group 1) and 56 patients with symptomatic lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patients were divided into three groups: group 2, 25 patients with a fair outcome without any cerebrovascular attack or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>progressive dementia</z:hpo> (mean follow-up period: 4.4 years); group 3, 14 patients with worsening of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rating and silent lesions, which included lacunae and diffuse white matter lesions (4.5 years), and group 4, 17 patients who developed symptomatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (1.7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRIs and ambulatory BP monitoring were performed for each patient on two separate occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No patient was treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive agents</z:chebi> during the course of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In group 2, the second measurements were significantly higher than the first for 24-hour systolic BP (SBP), daytime SBP, 24-hour diastolic BP (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>), daytime <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.01, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) and nighttime <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In group 3, the second measurements were significantly lower than the first for 24-hour SBP, daytime SBP, 24-hour <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>, and daytime <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.01, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In group 4, the second measurements were significantly lower than the first for 24-hour SBP and daytime SBP (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The correlation between BP and pulse rate became positive for group 2 in second measurements, but was not positive for groups 3 and 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BP tended to elevate over time in patients with a fair outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, BP tended to decrease in those who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and symptomatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Autonomic functions including sympathetic activity might play a role in changes in BP in lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patients during the course of disease </plain></SENT>
