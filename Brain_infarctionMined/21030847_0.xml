<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We analyzed forensic autopsy findings of 66 consecutive patients with fatal closed head injury who survived up to 48 days after trauma to ascertain the causal factors and the time course of development of posttraumatic pituitary lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pituitary lesions were identified in 27 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with pituitary lesions, posterior lobe <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was observed in 21 patients, followed by anterior lobe <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in 10 patients and anterior lobe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparisons between patients with and without pituitary lesions showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> were significantly frequent in patients with pituitary lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry of neurophysin showed increased immunoreactivity in the hypothalamus of patients with pituitary lesions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, providing morphologic evidence of pituitary dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Hemorrhage</z:mp> in the anterior or posterior lobe was identifiable in patients with short survival periods, whereas <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the anterior lobe appeared in patients surviving at least 14 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data further our understanding of the mechanisms of pituitary dysfunctions and help in the estimation of the survival period after head trauma </plain></SENT>
