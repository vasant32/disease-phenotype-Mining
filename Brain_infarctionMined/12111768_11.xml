<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are no previous studies of silent cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, which have been described in up to 20% of American children with Hb SS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have carried out a prospective brain MRI study among otherwise <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> SCD patients, who were consecutive patients seen in a 1-year period to document the prevalence of silent cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> in Kuwait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Any patient with a previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> or other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurological abnormality</z:hpo> was excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI was done with a 1.5 Tesla unit with super-conducting magnet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T1- and T2-weighted sagittal and axial sections and proton density axial images were obtained in 5-mm thick sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study group consisted of 30 (23 SS and 7 Sbeta(0)Thal) patients-19 males and 11 females-whose ages ranged from 6 to 17 (mean of 9.8 +/- 3.5) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hb F ranged from 11% to 35% with a mean of 22.8% +/- 5.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only one patient, a 10-and-a-half-year-old boy with Hb SS, showed hyperintense signals in the parietal white matter, consistent with small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, thus giving a prevalence of 3.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are uncommon in our patients, and the protective factors remain to be fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
