<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Whereas stress is known to be one of the risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, few experimental studies have examined the possible mechanisms by which stress may affect <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of the knowledge on the effects of stress on cerebrovascular disease in humans is restricted to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> effects on blood pressure and/or development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By using an experimental paradigm consisting of the exposure of Fischer rats to repeated immobilization sessions (1 h daily during seven consecutive days) prior to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), we have found that stress worsens behavioral outcome and increases <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These changes occur concomitantly to an increase in inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) expression and to the accumulation of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation markers in brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The possible regulatory role of TNFalpha was studied by looking at the mechanisms of release of this cytokine as well as to the expression of its receptors (TNFR1 and 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of the present study suggest an increase in TNFalpha expression and release after stress, as well as an increase in the expression of TNFR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological blockade of TNFalpha with anti-TNFalpha led to a decrease in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size as well as in the oxidative/nitrosative biochemical parameters seen after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, our results indicate that TNFalpha accounts, at least partly, for the worsening of MCAO consequences in brain of rats exposed to stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the data presented here provide evidence that stress can increase brain ischemic damage and support a possible protective effect of treatment of stressful situations before and during the development of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
