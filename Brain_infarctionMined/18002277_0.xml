<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, their accurate identification is often difficult task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop a computer-aided diagnosis scheme for the detection of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our database consisted of 1,143 T1- and 1,143 T2-weighted images obtained from 132 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We first segmented the cerebral region in the T1- weighted image by using a region growing technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For identifying the initial lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> candidates, white top-hat transform and multiple-phase binarization were then applied to the T2- weighted image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For eliminating false positives (FPs), we determined 12 features, i.e., the locations x and y, density differences in the T1- and T2- weighted images, nodular components (NC), and nodular &amp; linear components (NLC) from a scale 1 to 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The NCs and NLCs were obtained using filter bank technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rule-based scheme and a neural network with 12 features were employed as the first step for eliminating FPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The modular classifier was then used for eliminating three typical sources of FPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As a result, the sensitivity of the detection of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was 96.8% with 0.30 FP per image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our computerized scheme would assist radiologists in identifying lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
