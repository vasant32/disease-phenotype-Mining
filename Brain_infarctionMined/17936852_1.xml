<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have described microvascular disturbances downstream of occluded large vessels arising during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase (several hours) following cerebral ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prolonged microvascular disturbances may cause delayed neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in ischemic penumbral regions, leading to expanded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> and poor neurological and functional outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lack of simple and quantitative methods for investigating this microcirculation failure suggests the need to develop a new method for clarifying the precise distribution and persistence of post-ischemic microvascular disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study used a <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> rubber casting method in quantitative analyses of microvascular conditions in photochemically-induced thromboembolic (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PIT</z:e>) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rat models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the casting procedure in rats with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PIT</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, a 6 microm-thick coronal section was obtained, and quantitative analyses of microvascular density and measurements of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area in the serial section were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The major findings of the present study are as follows: (1) <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">Silicone</z:chebi> rubber casting techniques can be applied to precise quantitative analyses of microvessels in the same individual in whom brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured; (2) the persistence and spatial distribution of microvascular disturbances assessed at the ischemic core, ischemic penumbra, and non-ischemic regions strongly suggest that microvascular disturbances affect brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> expansion; (3) the current method demonstrated the protective effects of MK-801 on microvessels, indicating that the technique may be useful in investigating factors that provide vascular protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The experimental procedure introduced here would facilitate future evaluations of vascular <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50267">protective agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
