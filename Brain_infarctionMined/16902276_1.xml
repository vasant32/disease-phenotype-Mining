<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 413 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients who had undergone carotid ultrasonography was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High-resolution B-mode ultrasonography was used to evaluate the characteristics of carotid plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationships between the incidence of echolucent carotid plaque and clustering of risk factors (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Echolucent plaques were present in 10.5% of patients free of risk factors, in 18.8% with a single risk factor (NS), in 27.7% with two risk factors (p &lt;0.01) and in 50.0% with three risk factors (p &lt;0.001), and were significantly more common in patients with multiple risk factors (odds ratio 1.79; 95% CI, 1.05-3.06; p = 0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Echolucent plaques were observed in 41.2% of patients with atherothrombotic infarction, in 17.6% with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e>, in 11.5% with cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and in 25.0% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, and were significantly more common in patients with atherothrombotic infarction than in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> or cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (p&lt;0.001), or in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (p &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The clustering of risk factors increased the incidence of echolucent carotid plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with multiple risk factors were at increased risk of echolucent plaque, and these had a significant relationship with atherothrombotic infarction compared with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
