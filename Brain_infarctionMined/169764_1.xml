<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two cases of cytomegaly of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system of infants, disclosing typical <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> inclusions in the brain tissues, associated with agenesia of the corpus callosum and cystic symmetrical post-infarction <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the callosal defect was caused by cystic degeneration occuring within the lamina reuniens and the prematurely fused sulcus medianus, in early intrauterine life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The possibility of cytomegalic etiology of the malformation is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However the occurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> disease in a previous abnormal brain cannot be discarded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cystic symmetrical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> is explained through a redistribution (shunting) of the cerebral blood flow, brought about by the existence of a peculiar mechanism which he calls - priority blood supplying system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This proposed system probably acts independently of the cerebral blood flow autoregulatory mechanisms in emergency states, shunting the blood to the vitaly more important homeostatic neurovegetative centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This mechanism, in spite of its actual effectiveness, if prolonged, may be deleterious to the excluded territories and produce irreversible damages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The morphologic expression of these damages are the multiple symmetrical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following occasional survival, the tissue debris of the destroyed structures in the involved areas, are slowly and progressively removed by reabsorption and replaced by unusual symmetrical cavitations </plain></SENT>
