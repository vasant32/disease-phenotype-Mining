<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether viable neurones of low functional activity are represented in in vivo neuroreceptor imaging, we undertook experiments in gerbils with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, in which we examined histological changes and the results of dual-tracer in vivo autoradiography of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization with <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-labelled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> receptor binding with 123I-labelled Ro 16-0154 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The unrelated findings of cerebral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> receptor binding were observed in the primary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> lesion and in remote areas, including the ipsilateral striatum and thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our experiments showed that when viable neurones with low functional activity remain intact, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in vivo binding to <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> receptors is demonstrated as hypometabolism of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This functional, contrast-enhanced technique with 123I-labelled Ro 16-0154 may have an important role to play in the prediction of neuronal cell viability after recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in experimental animals and humans using single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission tomography (SPET) </plain></SENT>
