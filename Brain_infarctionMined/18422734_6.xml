<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of systemic adaptive immunity on the progression of such disease manifestations is less clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we evaluated the percentages of T helper 1 (Th1) [interleukin (IL)-2, interferon (IFN)-gamma] and Th2 (IL-4, IL-10) cytokine-producing peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in 23 patients with a history of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (IS) at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stable phase of the disease (median post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> time 34.5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free individuals matched for age and vascular risk factors (matched controls, MC) were collected for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To measure cytokine values at baseline and after stimulation, we used a flow cytometry method of intracellular cytokine staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intrinsic Th1 and Th2 cytokine production in unstimulated T cells was negligible in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> study participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following mitogenic stimulation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> 12-myristate13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>/ionomycin, both the IS and the MC groups exhibited a similarly strong Th1 response; IL-2 production predominated in the CD4+ T cells and IFN-gamma in the CD8+ T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, when measuring the Th2 cytokine-production capacity post-stimulation, a significant increase in the percentage of IL-4-producing T cells was observed in the IS groups, compared with the MC group, resulting in a significantly lower ratio of IFN-gamma-/IL-4-producing T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No such Th2 enhancement could be confirmed for the case of IL-10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We propose that in IS patients there is a systemic shift of the immune system towards Th2 responses at the late post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
