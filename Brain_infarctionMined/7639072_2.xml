<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period averaged 3.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The clinical and radiological data on patients in 1989 were collected from hospital records and re-evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were re-examined clinically (including 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement), and neuroradiologically (CT) in 1992 for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 11 (29%) patients were found to have significant (rapid) progression of the extent of LA on CT during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At baseline, there was no significant difference in the mean number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> between the groups with progressing (prLA) and non-progressing LA (nprLA) or between the number of cortical and central infarctions within these groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, the total number of infarctions had increased significantly in both groups, but it was mostly because of the increase in cortical infarctions in the prLA group (p = 0.043) and, conversely, the central ones in the nprLA group (p = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>prLA was found to be related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (82% vs 37%, p = 0.029) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (55% vs 19%, p = 0.047), whereas nprLA was strongly associated with a sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms (78% vs prLA 18%, p = 0.001) like a true <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other clinical factors, including mean blood pressure and heart rate, did not clearly differentiate between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggest that there are different subgroups of patients with LA associated with various vascular factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of LA is not related to the distribution of infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The progression of LA is not related to the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> or to the simultaneous increase of infarctions on CT </plain></SENT>
