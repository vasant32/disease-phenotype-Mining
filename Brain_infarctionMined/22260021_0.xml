<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>First, middle cerebral artery <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury model was established, and each group was treated with the corresponding medicines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals were separately sacrificed at 24 h and 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were detected by TTC dye, bcl-2 and bax <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was checked by RT-PCR, and the proteins of bcl-2 and bax were explored by two-step immunohistochemistry in cerebral cortex of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lactuside B can reduce brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of cerebral cortex of rats, increase the expression of bcl-2 mRNA and decrease that of bax <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the ratio of bcl-2 to bax <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is higher in 12.5 and 25 mg kg(-1) dose group, respectively, which is significantly different from that of model group (P &lt; 0.05 or P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Generally, either 12.5 or 25 mg kg(-1) dose group is better than positive control medicine nimodipine (P &lt; 0.05 or P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the expression of bcl-2 and bax protein is consistent with their gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume and the ratio of bcl-2 to bax <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression are significantly different (P &lt; 0.05 or P &lt; 0.01) between 72 h and 24 h group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that lactuside B could play a good role in resisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by upregulating the expression of bcl-2 mRNA and protein and downregulating that of bax <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein </plain></SENT>
