<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We designed and conducted a randomized, double-masked, controlled multicenter study to determine whether inhaled nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (INO) in term and near-term infants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000776'>congenital diaphragmatic hernia</z:hpo> (CDH) would reduce the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and/or the initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Infants of 34 weeks gestation or more, &lt;14 days of age with CDH, without known structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, requiring assisted ventilation for hypoxemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> with two oxygenation indices (OIs) of 25 or more at least 15 minutes apart, were eligible for this trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Infants were centrally randomized and then received masked treatment with 20 ppm NO or 100% oxygen as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Infants with less than a full response to 20 ppm NO (increase in PaO2 &gt; 20 Torr) after 30 minutes were evaluated at 80 ppm NO/control study gas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 28 control and 25 treated infants enrolled by the 13 participating centers were not significantly different at randomization for any of the measured variables including prerandomization therapies and initial OIs (45.8 +/- 16.3 for controls, 44.5 +/- 14.5 for INO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> at &lt;120 days of age or the need for ECMO occurred in 82% of control infants compared with 96% of INO infants (ns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> occurred in 43% of controls and 48% of the INO group (ns), and ECMO treatment was used for 54% of control and 80% of INO-treated infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant improvement in PaO2 (delta PaO2 7.8 +/- 19.8 vs 1.1 +/- 7.6 Torr, ns) nor significant reduction in OI (-2.7 +/- 23.4 vs 4.0 +/- 14.8, ns) associated with INO treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean peak <z:chebi fb="34" ids="33101">nitrogen dioxide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="16301,29423,29424,29785,29786,33101">NO2</z:chebi>) concentration was 1.9 +/- 1.3 ppm and the mean peak methemoglobin was 1.6 +/- 0.8 mg/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No infant had study gas discontinued for toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between the control and INO groups for the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, specific grades of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006970'>periventricular leukomalacia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, and pulmonary or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal hemorrhages</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the immediate short-term improvements in oxygenation seen in some treated infants may be of benefit in stabilizing responding infants for transport and initiation of ECMO, we conclude that for term and near-term infants with CDH and hypoxemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> unresponsive to conventional therapy, inhaled NO therapy as used in this trial did not reduce the need for ECMO or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
