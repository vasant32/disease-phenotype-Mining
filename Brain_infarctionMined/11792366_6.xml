<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Under <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> anesthesia, male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A selective central type prostacyclin receptor ligand, 15-deoxy-(16-m-tolyl)-17,18,19,20-tetranorisocarbacyclin methylester, or a peripheral type prostacyclin receptor ligand, iloprost methylester, were administered intravenously immediately after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia, brain</z:e> damage was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In separate experiments, concentrations of 15-deoxy-(16-m-tolyl)-17,18,19,20-tetranorisocarbacyclin in ischemic brain tissue were measured by injection of a <z:chebi fb="13" ids="29298">tritium</z:chebi> labeled compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 15-deoxy-(16-m-tolyl)-17,18,19,20-tetranorisocarbacyclin methylester (0.03 mg/kg) significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced the volume of brain damage by 35% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With this treatment, the concentration of this compound in the brain was more than 10 nM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with iloprost methylester did not show a neuroprotective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that activation of a central type prostacyclin receptor attenuates ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrated that the intravenous application of a central type prostacyclin receptor ligand could be a novel therapeutic agent for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
