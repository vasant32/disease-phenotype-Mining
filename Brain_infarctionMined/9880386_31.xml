<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed at clarifying in detail the factors related to these delays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a prospective, multicenter, consecutive study that explored factors influencing the time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> until patient arrival at the emergency department, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit, and CT laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within 3 days of hospital admission, the patients and/or their relatives were interviewed by use of a standardized structured protocol, and the patients' neurological deficits were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No information about this study was given to the public or to the staff </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients (n=329) were studied at 15 Swedish academic or community-based hospitals: 252 subjects with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, 18 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and 59 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients, the median times from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to hospital admission, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit, and CT scan laboratory were 4.8 and 4.0 hours, 8.8 and 7.5 hours, and 22.0 and 17.5 hours, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From multivariate ANOVA with logarithmically transformed time for increasing delay to hospital admission as the dependent variable, a profile of significant risk factors was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This included patients with a brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, gradual <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, mild neurological symptoms, patients who were alone and did not contact anybody when symptoms occurred, patients who lived in a large catchment area, those who did not use ambulance transportation, and those who visited a primary care site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These factors explained 45.3% of the variance in delayed hospital admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median time from arrival at the emergency department to arrival at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit or CT scan laboratory (whichever occurred first) was 2.6 and 2.7 hours in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A large catchment area, moderate to mild neurological deficit, and waiting for the physician at the emergency department were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly related to in-hospital delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased public awareness of the need to seek medical or other attention promptly after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, to use an ambulance with direct transportation to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-care hospital, and to have more effective in-hospital organization will be required for effective <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> treatment options to be available to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
