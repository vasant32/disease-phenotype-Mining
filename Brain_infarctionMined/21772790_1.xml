<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After monopolar stimulation, the latency of <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> was significantly prolonged, and the amplitude was less reduced in the BMSC group in comparison with the control group (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEPs</z:chebi> induced by bipolar stimulation in the left forelimb could be measured in 40% of the BMSC group and the I wave that was not detected in the control group was also detected in 40% of the BMSC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our preliminary results imply that BMSCs transplanted to the ischemic rat brain mediate effects on the functional recovery of the cerebral motor cortex and the motor pathway </plain></SENT>
