<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that plasma levels of angiopoietin-2 and variants of angiopoietin-2 will confer risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The association of plasma angiopoietin-2 (determined by using ELISA) and the variants in angiopoietin-2 promoter with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence was tested in 1735 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of three subtypes, lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (n=475), atherothrombotic (n=794) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (n=466), for a period of following-up 4.5 years (mean), the association was evaluated by using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Cox regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that angiopoietin-2 levels were associated with risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence in lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Taking the lowest quartile as reference, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence was 1.48 (0.74-2.95) for the second quartile, 2.56 (1.35-4.86) for the third and 2.15 (1.11-4.17) for the fourth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Allele T of rs3739391 in angiopoietin-2 promoter was associated with elevated angiopoietin-2 levels and increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence in patients with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> with HR 1.67 (1.06-2.63) relative to the allele C, but neither in those with atherothrombotic nor in those with hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that both angiopoietin-2 and allele T of rs3739391 might be the risk marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings may help to improve future prevention or therapy strategies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Even some conventional risk factors have been identified responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence, but these factors could not fully explain <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study opens a new page for the first time that angiopoietin/tie2 pathway has a potential role in lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since several strategies are available for blocking or neutralizing plasma angiopoietin-2, especially eicosapentaenoic acid rich in sea food </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our finding obviously has its clinical implication if it was proved by large, prospective clinical studies </plain></SENT>
