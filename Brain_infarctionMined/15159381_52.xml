<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the hippocampus is vulnerable to global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, which may lead to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association of midlife blood pressure (BP) and late-life HA in a sample of Japanese-American men born between 1900 and 1919 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BP was measured on 3 occasions between 1965 and 1971 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 1994 to 1996 a subsample underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal volume was estimated by manually drawing regions of interest on relevant scan slices; HA was defined as the lowest quartile of hippocampal volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also assessed on the MRI were cortical and subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, lacunes, and white matter hyperintensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk (OR, 95% CI) was estimated for HA associated with systolic (&lt;140 versus &gt; or =140 mm Hg) and diastolic (&lt;90 versus &gt; or =90 mm Hg) BP and with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic factors, other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E allele, and correlated brain pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Those never treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medication had a significantly increased risk for HA (OR 1.7; CI=1.12; 2.65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The nontreated subjects with high systolic BP had an increased risk (OR=1.98; CI=0.89; 4.39) for HA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Results were similar for untreated men with high diastolic BP (OR=3.51; CI=1.26; 9.74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment modifies the association of BP and HA, such that high levels of BP adversely affect the hippocampus in persons never treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensives</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
