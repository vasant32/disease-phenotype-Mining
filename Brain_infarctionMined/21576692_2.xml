<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This observational cohort study included consecutive MRI-scanned patients aged 15 to 49 with first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> treated at Helsinki University Central Hospital (1994-2007) with long-term follow-up data available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures were 1) nonfatal or fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, 2) composite vascular endpoint, and 3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from any cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Trial of ORG 10172 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Treatment (TOAST) and Bamford criteria allowed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Number of SBIs was categorized into none, single, or multiple </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LA fell into groups of none, mild, or moderate to severe (validated visual rating scale) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 655 patients (mean age 40.0 ± 8.0 years) included were followed for a mean 8.7 ± 3.8 years (survivors) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 86 (13.1%) patients with SBIs, 46 had single and 40 had multiple SBIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the 50 (7.6%) patients with LA, these changes were mild in 21 and moderate to severe in 29 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In Cox regression analysis, multiple SBIs independently raised the risk for recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (odds ratio 2.48; 95% confidence interval 1.24-4.94) adjusted for age, gender, risk factors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> etiology, and LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After further adjustment for initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity, TOAST and Bamford subgroups, and presence of SBIs, moderate to severe LA increased the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (3.43; 1.58-7.42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neither SBIs nor LA associated with the composite vascular endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MRI-defined SBIs and LA are prognostically valuable in young adults after their first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
