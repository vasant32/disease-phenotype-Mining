<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: On cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and lacunes are generally viewed as evidence of small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of small vessel disease in terms of global cognitive function has as yet not been completely clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the independent contribution of WMH and lacunes to general cognitive function in a group of independently living elderly with varying degrees of small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were drawn from the multicenter, multinational <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022783" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Leukokraurosis</z:e> and Disability (LADIS) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 633 independently living participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>General cognitive function was assessed using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the modified <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer Disease</z:hpo> Assessment Scale (ADAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On MRI, WMH was rated as mild, moderate, or severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lacunes were rated as none, few (1 to 3), or many (4 or more) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the basic analysis, increasing severity of both WMH and lacunes was related to deteriorating score on the MMSE and ADAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When WMH and lacunes were entered simultaneously, both MRI measures remained significantly associated with MMSE score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increasing severity of WMH remained associated with ADAS score, whereas the association with lacunes became less prominent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These associations were independent of other risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, like education, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, vascular risk factors, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found WMH and lacunes to be independently associated with general cognitive function in a sample of independently living elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results highlight the fact that WMH and lacunes should both be evaluated when assessing small vessel disease in relation to cognitive function </plain></SENT>
