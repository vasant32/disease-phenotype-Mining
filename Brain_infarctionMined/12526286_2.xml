<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fibrinogen and CRP levels were measured in blood samples obtained from 83 patients admitted to hospital within 72 h of a first ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were evaluated clinically with the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), and results were compared with 43 age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fibrinogen and CRP levels in unconscious patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> were higher than those in conscious hemiplegic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, the difference in GOS values between the unconscious patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> and conscious patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> was statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the median cerebral artery and anterior cerebral artery had higher fibrinogen and CRP concentrations than the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, fibrinogen and CRP may be important measures for determining the prognosis and outcome in patients following ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
