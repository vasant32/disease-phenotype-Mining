<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean values of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the calculated circulation time parameters in the infarcted hemisphere were significantly slower than those of the contralateral hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The difference between the hemispheres proved a more sensitive parameter than absolute values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both the quantitative circulation time differences between the hemispheres and the absolute circulation time values showed significant correlations with several clinical findings, e.g. severity of infarction, recovery from infarction, and patient's age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, quantification gave only a minor addition to the number of the patients with abnormalities detected by routine static and dynamic brain scintigrams </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Though the value of the quantitative intravenous 99mTechnetium method in routine clinical work is limited, it provides valuable information on the haemodynamics in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, e.g. the persistence of measurable asymmetry suggesting decreased function even of non-infarcted parts of the affected hemisphere ("deafferentiation") </plain></SENT>
