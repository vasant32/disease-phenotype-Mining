<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The authors examined whether delayed treatment with Mg++ would reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and improve electrophysiological and neurobehavioral recovery following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 90 minutes followed by 72 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">Magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> (750 micromol/kg) or vehicle was given via intracarotid infusion at the beginning of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurobehavioral outcome and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) were examined before and 72 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain infarction</z:e> was assessed after the rats had died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion, stable SSEP waveforms were recorded after individual fore- and hindpaw stimulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 72 hours of perfusion the SSEPs recorded from ischemic fore- and hindpaw cortical fields were depressed in vehicle-injected animals and the amplitudes decreased to 19 and 27% of baseline, respectively (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relative to controls, the amplitudes of SSEPs recorded from both ischemic fore- and hindpaw cortical field in the Mg++-treated animals were significantly improved by 23% (p &lt; 0.005) and 39% (p &lt; 0.001) of baselines, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, Mg++ improved sensory and motor neurobehavioral outcomes by 34% (p &lt; 0.01) and 24% (p &lt; 0.05), respectively, and reduced cortical (p &lt; 0.05) and striatal (p &lt; 0.05) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> sizes by 42 and 36%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Administration of Mg++ at the commencement of reperfusion enhances electrophysiological and neurobehavioral recovery and reduces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because Mg++ has already been used clinically, it may be worthwhile to investigate it further to see if it holds potential benefits for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and for those who will undergo carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
