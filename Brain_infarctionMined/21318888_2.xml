<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was determined whether <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> can serve as a biochemical marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> rapidly reacts with lysine residues in protein, protein-conjugated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> (PC-Acro) was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PC-Acro was increased at the locus of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and in plasma in a mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> involving photochemically induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An increase in PC-Acro in plasma was found to be a good biochemical marker in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using a receiver operating characteristic curve, the combined measurement of PC-Acro, IL-6 and CRP together with age indicated silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (SBI) with 89% sensitivity and 91% specificity </plain></SENT>
