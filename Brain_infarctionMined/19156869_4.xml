<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed the spatiotemporal profile of p75(NTR) expression after an ischemic lesion induced by cortical devascularization (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results show that p75(NTR) expression occurs in isolated neurons of the ischemic lesion site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The p75(NTR+) neurons presented morphological alterations and active caspase-3 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some p75(NTR+) neurons were also positive for sortilin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The peak of p75(NTR) expression was localized 3 days postlesion (3DPL) in the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sp1 transcription factor nuclear localization was observed in p75(NTR+) neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The overall level of Sp1 expression was increased until 14DPL on the ipsilateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>With primary cortical neurons, we demonstrated that p75(NTR) expression is induced by excitotoxic stress and correlated with increased Sp1 abundance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We conclude that p75(NTR) expression is localized in selected neurons of the ischemic lesion and that these neurons are probably condemned to apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In primary neuronal culture, it is clear that excitotoxicity and Sp1 are involved in induction of p75(NTR) expression, although, in vivo, some additional mechanisms are likely to be involved in the control of p75(NTR) expression in specific neurons in vivo </plain></SENT>
