<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The paraaortic counterpulsation device was implanted on the ascending aorta of three male patients with intractable cardiogenic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were assisted for 4 hours and 8 and 54 days, respectively; the first patient died as a result of nonresponding peripheral vasodilation and the other two died of septic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two patients who were assisted for 8 and 54 days were conscious and able to function in a limited manner during the mechanical assistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Discontinuation of the mechanical support for a few seconds was followed by low systolic arterial pressure (30 to 60 mm Hg) and syncopal episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biochemical tests and autopsy results in these patients showed no evidence of blood cell destruction, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, or other distal emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, satisfactory hemodynamic effects, excellent biocompatibility, and simplicity of the implantation procedure in these patients encourage the use of the paraaortic counterpulsation device as a bridge to heart transplantation </plain></SENT>
