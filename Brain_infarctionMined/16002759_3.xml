<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Endothelial dysfunction</z:e> has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cerebral small-vessel disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endothelin (ET), released by the endothelium, plays a crucial role in vasoconstriction in the cerebral circulation and could contribute to the pathogenesis of cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Circulating ET levels may not reflect vascular production of endothelin-1 (ET-1), most of which is abluminal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studying genetic associations, particularly of functional polymorphisms that alter activity of the ET system, is an attractive method of determining whether ET plays a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We determined whether genetic variants in components of the ET system are a risk factor for cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three hundred <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> patients and 600 community controls were genotyped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms in the ET-1 gene (K198N), the ET receptor type A (<z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi>), (-231G&gt;A and +1222C&gt;T), and the ET type B (ETB) receptor (G57S and L277L) were genotyped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms were studied both individually and as haplotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With brain imaging, cases were subtyped into those with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> without leukoaraiosis and those with leukoaraiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> cases and controls for any individual single-nucleotide polymorphism or the <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi> haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between cases with isolated lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> or with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and leukoaraiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study, in a well-phenotyped population, does not support a role for genetic variation in the ET system as a risk factor for cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
