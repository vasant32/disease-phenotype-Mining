<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study examines the capacity of fetal neocortical grafts placed in a brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> to exchange axonal projections with the host brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five to 7 days after a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in adult spontaneously hypertensive rats, dissociated neocortical primordium from fetuses of gestational age 15-16 days was implanted into the infarcted area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four to 11 months later, the neural tracers Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53251">Fluoro-Gold</z:chebi> were injected in the grafts and host neocortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An extensive axonal network was present in the transplants but only one of eight rats with appropriate placed injections displayed efferent connections from transplant to host </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sparse axonal outgrowth indicates major limitations for fetal rat cortical grafts to form connections with host neural circuitries after an ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
