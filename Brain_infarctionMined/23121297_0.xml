<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pre-existing brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (PBI), frequently seen on magnetic resonance imaging and usually silent, is recognized as a risk factor for future <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B (apoB)/apoAI ratio is known to be a risk predictor of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and is associated with intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the association of apoB/apoAI ratio with PBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 522 statin-/fibrate-naïve Korean patients, who experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, were categorized into three groups: ICAS (n = 254), extracranial (n = 51), and no cerebral atherosclerotic stenosis (n = 217) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We explored the association between apoB/apoAI ratio and PBI lesions according to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> type (ICAS, ECAS, and NCAS), PBI location (deep subcortical [ds-PBI] versus hemispheric [h-PBI]), and symptomatic PBI (s-PBI) which was relevant to a prior clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pre-existing brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>(+) patients showed a higher apoB/apoAI ratio than PBI(-) patients (0.81 ± 0.28 vs. 0.72 ± 0.23, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In ICAS group, patients with higher apoB/apoAI ratio quartiles had more PBIs, ds-PBIs, and s-PBIs (P = 0.020, P = 0.025, and P = 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With multivariable analyses, the highest apoB/apoAI ratio quartile was associated with PBI (OR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.39-4.73), ds-PBI (2.48; 1.33-4.62), and advanced (≥3) ds-PBIs (2.68; 1.27-5.63) in ICAS group, but not with h-PBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>s-PBI had a dose-response relationship with apoB/apoAI ratio quartiles (6.18; 1.31-29.13 for the second; 5.34; 1.06-26.83 for the third; and 12.17; 2.50-59.19 for the fourth quartile), when referenced to the first quartile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ApoB/apoAI ratio is associated with asymptomatic deep subcortical ischaemic burden as well as with symptomatic lesion in patients with ICAS </plain></SENT>
