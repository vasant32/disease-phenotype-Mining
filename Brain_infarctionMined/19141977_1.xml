<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-healthy male adult Sprague-Dawley rats (3 to approximately 4 month old) were randomly divided into a pseudo-operative group, a model group, and an HBO therapy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model was duplicated with suture methods, then we used beam walking test (BWT) to determine the motor skill of the rats and immunohistochemistry method to detect the distribution and location of microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect the expression of Map-2 mRNA and GFAP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry showed that the fluorescence gray scale value of Map-2 in the HBO group was the highest in 3 groups at 1st week and 2nd week (P&lt;0.05).The value of GFAP was lower than that of the model group but higher than that of the sham operated group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Real-time fluorescence-quantitative PCR indicated that the Map-2 mRNA of HBO group was the highest in 3 groups at 1st week and 2nd week (P&lt;0.05); but the value of GFAP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the HBO group is lower than that of the model group,but higher than that of the sham operated group at 1st week and 2nd week (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: After <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, giving hyperbaric oxygenation treatment can improve the limbs motor function, and hyperbaric oxygenation treatment can increase the expression of Map-2 and decrease the expression of GFAP, which promote neural plasticity </plain></SENT>
