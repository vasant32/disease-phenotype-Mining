<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report for the first time involvement of AIF in neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unilateral cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (HI) was induced in 7-day-old rats by ligation of the left carotid artery and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (7.7% O2) for 55 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIF release from mitochondria and AIF translocation to nuclei was detected immediately after HI, and only in damaged areas, as judged by the concurrent loss of MAP-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AIF release was detected earlier than that of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cells with AIF-positive nuclei displayed nuclear condensation and signs of DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of AIF-positive nuclei showed a positive correlation with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume 72 h post-HI, and this was not changed by treating the animals with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="48502">boc</z:chebi>-Asp-fmk (BAF), a multicaspase inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BAF treatment reduced the activity of caspase-3, -2 and -9 (78, 73 and 33%, respectively), and prevented caspase-dependent fodrin cleavage in vivo, but did not affect AIF release from mitochondria or the frequency of positive nuclear AIF or DNA damage 72 h post-HI, indicating that these processes occurred in a caspase-independent fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, AIF-mediated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> may be an important mechanism of HI-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> in the immature brain </plain></SENT>
