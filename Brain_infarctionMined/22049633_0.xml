<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> as a medical and linguistic condition has been widely examined, the more social and participatory aspects of the symptom are not so well-known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>Aphasia</z:hpo> forms a threat to the emergence of a shared understanding, as well as to the experience of being in the shared, i.e., in the intersubjective, social world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our analysis, we closely explore how understanding is constructed in the sequential organization of conversation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We use two data corpora when analysing the halting interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In our data, we detected two kinds of interactive halts that emerged in connection with aphasic word searching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>First, 'real halts' were caused by the aphasic person's inability to find correct words and the co-participants were also not able to resolve the problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Second, 'exam halts' occurred when the co-participant did not provide the missing words despite knowing what the aphasic speaker was trying to say </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We discuss how this halting phenomenon is linked with the notions of intersubjectivity and face-work and conclude that real halts are more directly caused by the aphasic condition, whereas exam halts reflect the spousal relationship in the form of face-work </plain></SENT>
