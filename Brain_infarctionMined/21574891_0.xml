<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the functional and histological recovery of middle cerebral artery occluded (MCAo) rats after of duplicate intravenous (i.v.) injection of human neural stem cells (hNSCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats received i.v. injections of hNSCs (HB1.F3, 4 Ã— 10(6) cells) on day 1 (1C), day 7 (7C), or both days 1 and 7 (1/7C) following MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Functional recovery of rats was evaluated 1 day before MCAo and 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days following MCAo, using the modified neurological severity score (mNSS), and cylinder test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nissl staining and anti-human nuclear matrix antigen /NeuN or GFAP were used to measure <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and investigate the migration and differentiation of injected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with hNSCs did not significantly affect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size of ischemic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Behavior evaluation using mNSS showed that functional deficits in the 1C group were reduced faster than in the 7C and 1/7C groups, and functional recovery in 1/7C rats was significantly more pronounced than that in the 7C group (day 21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Injected cells were identified at the boundary of lesions, where they had differentiated into neurons and astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that duplicate i.v. administration of hNSCs after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> offers no advantages over single administration, 1 day following an ischemic event </plain></SENT>
