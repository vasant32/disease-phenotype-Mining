<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: This article describes two patients with major <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> symptoms who had extremely small areas of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, suggestive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intrahemispheric diaschisis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both patients were using narcotic <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesics</z:chebi> during their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and in both cases the clinical deficits improved dramatically with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: We postulate that the narcotics amplified the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> symptoms and that this effect was antagonized by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This suggests that the opiate system may be involved in the process of intrahemispheric diaschisis </plain></SENT>
