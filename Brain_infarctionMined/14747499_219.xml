<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CONTEXT: Clinical series have suggested an increased prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and white matter lesions (WMLs) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is not known whether these lesions are prevalent in the general <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To compare the prevalence of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and WMLs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> cases and controls from the general population and to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> characteristics associated with these lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional, prevalence study of population-based sample of Dutch adults aged 30 to 60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Randomly selected patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>migraine with aura</z:hpo> (n = 161), patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002083'>migraine without aura</z:hpo> (n = 134), and controls (n = 140), who were frequency matched to cases for age, sex, and place of residence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nearly 50% of the cases had not been previously diagnosed by a physician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Brain magnetic resonance images were evaluated for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, by location and vascular supply territory, and for periventricular WMLs (PVWMLs) and deep WMLs (DWMLs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> compared with controls were examined by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> subtype (with or without aura) and monthly attack frequency (&lt;1 attack, &gt; or =1 attack), controlling for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and use of vasoconstrictor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants underwent a standard neurological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No participants reported a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or had relevant abnormalities at standard neurological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found no significant difference between patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> and controls in overall <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> prevalence (8.1% vs 5.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, in the cerebellar region of the posterior circulation territory, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> had a higher prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> than controls (5.4% vs 0.7%; P =.02; adjusted OR, 7.1; 95% CI, 0.9-55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The adjusted OR for posterior <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> varied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> subtype and attack frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The adjusted OR was 13.7 (95% CI, 1.7-112) for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>migraine with aura</z:hpo> compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> with a frequency of attacks of 1 or more per month, the adjusted OR was 9.3 (95% CI, 1.1-76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The highest risk was in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>migraine with aura</z:hpo> with 1 attack or more per month (OR, 15.8; 95% CI, 1.8-140) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Among women, the risk for high DWML load (top 20th percentile of the distribution of DWML load vs lower 80th percentile) was increased in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> compared with controls (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.0-4.1); this risk increased with attack frequency (highest in those with &gt; or =1 attack per month: OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.2-5.7) but was similar in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> with or without aura </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In men, controls and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> did not differ in the prevalence of DWMLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>There was no association between severity of PVWMLs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, irrespective of sex or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> frequency or subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These population-based findings suggest that some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> with and without aura are at increased risk for subclinical lesions in certain brain areas </plain></SENT>
