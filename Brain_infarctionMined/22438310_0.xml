<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between hsCRP levels and brain regional gray matter volume using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 109 community-dwelling healthy elderly subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain MRIs were processed with voxel-based morphometry using a custom template by applying diffeomorphic anatomical registration using the exponentiated lie algebra (DARTEL) procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found a significant negative correlation between regional gray matter volume of the posterior and lateral aspects of the left temporal cortex and hsCRP level after adjusting for age, gender, and intracranial volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that subjects who have mild <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> have decreased regional gray matter volume in the posterior and lateral aspects of the left temporal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, preventing the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> may be important for preventing a decrease in gray matter volume in healthy elderly subjects </plain></SENT>
