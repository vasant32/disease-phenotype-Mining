<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is uncertain whether deterioration after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is neurological and/or systemic (somatic) in origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 442 consecutive patients admitted with first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (FIS) were assessed by the Unified Neurological <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (UNSS) at admission, on hospitalization days 1, 2 and 3 and before discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 71/442 (16.1%) patients deteriorated during hospitalization, the worsening from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was early (&lt;or=72 h) in 67 (94.4%) of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority (57/71, 80.3%) had CT-confirmed cerebral causes and 14/71 (19.7%) had systemic causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The causes of late deterioration were exclusively systemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the logistic regression analysis the initial mean UNSS score was the only significant independent predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> deterioration (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early clinical deterioration in FIS patients results from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-inherent mechanisms while late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> deterioration is due primarily to systemic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An initially severe neurological deficit might predict further decline </plain></SENT>
