<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Changes in the cerebral metabolism and the excitability of brain areas remote from an ischaemic brain lesion have been reported in animals and humans and implicated as a mechanism relevant to functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine whether changes in the inhibitory and excitatory activity in motor cortex of the non-affected hemisphere are present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, and whether these changes are related to the extent of the patients' recovery of function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to study the first dorsal interosseus muscle (FDI) of the non-affected hand in 13 patients with good recovery of hand function after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and was compared with left hemispheric stimulation in 13 healthy age-matched volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the first experiment, paired-pulse TMS with the conditioning stimulus (CS) set at 80% of the subject's motor threshold (MT) and interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 2, 3, 10 and 15 ms was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the second experiment, different intensities of CS were used to study its inhibitory effect on a succeeding suprathreshold test stimulus at an ISI that was kept constant at 2 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a third experiment, the rise in motor evoked potential (<z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi>) amplitudes with increasing stimulus intensities was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two additional control experiments, the effect of left versus right hemispheric stimulation in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers and good versus poor recovery of hand function in patients after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on the excitability of inhibitory and excitatory activity was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MT, mean test <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> and recruitment curves were similar in patients and healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In those patients with good recovery, paired-pulse excitability was increased at ISIs of 2 and 3 ms, similar to healthy volunteers at ISIs of 10 and 15 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When tested with different CS intensities at an ISI of 2 ms, inhibitory activity was similar in patients and healthy subjects at small CS intensities, but faded rapidly at higher CS intensities in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in patients with poor recovery, this increase in cortical excitability at higher CS intensities was not seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The similarity of MT, mean test <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> and recruitment curves in patients and healthy volunteers indicates that the overall corticomotoneuronal excitability has not changed in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The similarity of the inhibitory effect at low CS intensities in the patients with good recovery and healthy subjects, and the steeper increase of conditioned <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> amplitude at higher CS intensities in the recovering patients suggest that in the patients' contralesional motor cortex the balance of excitatory and inhibitory activity was shifted towards an increase of excitatory activity in the neuronal circuits tested at ISIs of 2 and 3 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This shares similarities to mechanisms implicated as relevant for reorganizational processes after experimental brain injury and may be relevant for functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The absence of changes in cortical excitability in patients with poor recovery supports the relevance of our findings for recovery </plain></SENT>
