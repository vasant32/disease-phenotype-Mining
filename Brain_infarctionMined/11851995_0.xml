<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHOD: Descriptive study of 17 patients with cheiro-oral-pedal syndrome included in the Sagrat Cor Hospital of Barcelona <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Registry over a 11 year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cheiro-oral-pedal syndrome was present in 6 patients (35%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cheiro-oral syndrome</z:e> in 10 (59%) and isolated oral syndrome in 1 (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cheiro-oral-pedal syndrome was caused by a lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in 88% of patients and by atherotrombotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cheiro-oral-pedal syndrome accounted for 0.7% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (n = 2.244), 1% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (n = 1.649), 3.5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (n = 422) and 18.5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pure sensory lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (n = 80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thalamus (n = 13), internal capsule (n = 2), striatocapsular involvement (n = 1) and fronto-parietal involvement (n = 1) were the cerebral topographies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Absence of in hospital mortality and absence or mild neurological deficit at discharge from the hospital were present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lacune hypothesis is present in cheiro-oral-pedal syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cheiro-oral-pedal syndrome was caused by a lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in 88% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The thalamic topography is the most frequent and the prognosis in cheiro-oral-pedal syndrome is good </plain></SENT>
