<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However it has not been proven whether these two subtypes of SIVD have common pathophysiological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the changes of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the two subsets of SIVD to establish whether these two subtypes could be incorporated into the same group for the purpose of conducting clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve SIVD patients with predominant white matter lesions, 13 patients with predominant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> and 17 controls were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed to measure the regional CBF, and statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was applied to the analysis of the SPECT data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The normalized CBF (nCBF) in the bilateral thalami, the anterior cingulate gyri, the superior temporal gyri, the caudate heads and the left parahippocampal gyrus was significantly decreased in the SIVD patients compared to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This pattern of nCBF reduction was same in both the two subtypes of SIVD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the two subsets of SIVD may have a common nCBF abnormality, and Erkinjuntti's criteria offer a solution for researchers to identify the more homogeneous group of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
