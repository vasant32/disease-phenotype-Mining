<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Caspase-3 plasma levels were determined by ELISA at different time points after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 116 t-PA-treated patients and a control group of 40 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological status was evaluated by NIHSS scores and functional outcome by modified Rankin Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To assess brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth, serial brain magnetic resonance imaging scans including diffusion- (DWI) and perfusion-weighted (PWI) images were performed in a subgroup of 58 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma caspase-3 levels were higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients versus the control group throughout the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, caspase-3 level at 24h was associated with poorer short- and long-term neurological outcome and positively correlated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth assessed by diffusion-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that caspase-3 could be involved in recruitment of ischemic brain tissue being a marker of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth </plain></SENT>
