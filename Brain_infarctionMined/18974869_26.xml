<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Deciphering the mechanisms regulating the generation of new neurons and new oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, is of paramount importance to address new strategies to replace endogenous damaged cells in the adult brain and foster repair in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Upon brain injury, the extracellular concentrations of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23511,32460">cysteinyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotrienes</z:chebi> (cysLTs), two families of endogenous signaling molecules, are markedly increased at the site of damage, suggesting that they may act as "danger signals" to alert responses to tissue damage and start repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that, in brain telencephalon, GPR17, a recently deorphanized receptor for both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> and cysLTs (e.g., <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and LTD(4)), is normally present on neurons and on a subset of parenchymal quiescent oligodendrocyte precursor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also show that induction of brain injury using an established focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model in the rodent induces profound spatiotemporal-dependent changes of GPR17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the lesioned area, we observed an early and transient up-regulation of GPR17 in neurons expressing the cellular stress marker heat shock protein 70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic Resonance Imaging in living mice showed that the in vivo pharmacological or biotechnological knock down of GPR17 markedly prevents brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> evolution, suggesting GPR17 as a mediator of neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at this early ischemic stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At later times after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, GPR17 immuno-labeling appeared on microglia/macrophages infiltrating the lesioned area to indicate that GPR17 may also acts as a player in the remodeling of brain circuitries by microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At this later stage, parenchymal GPR17+ oligodendrocyte progenitors started proliferating in the peri-injured area, suggesting initiation of remyelination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To confirm a specific role for GPR17 in oligodendrocyte differentiation, the in vitro exposure of cortical pre-oligodendrocytes to the GPR17 endogenous ligands <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and LTD(4) promoted the expression of myelin basic protein, confirming progression toward mature oligodendrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, GPR17 may act as a "sensor" that is activated upon brain injury on several embryonically distinct cell types, and may play a key role in both inducing neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> inside the ischemic core and in orchestrating the local remodeling/repair response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Specifically, we suggest GPR17 as a novel target for therapeutic manipulation to foster repair of demyelinating wounds, the types of lesions that also occur in patients with multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
