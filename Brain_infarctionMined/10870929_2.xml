<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The case of a 68-year-old man with persistent upward <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112261" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gaze palsy</z:e> after a unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarction</z:e>, demonstrated on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans, is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subsequent high-resolution magnetic resonance scanning, however, showed involvement of the rostral mesencephalon as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors suggest that in previous patients with VGP ascribed to a unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarction</z:e>, a coexisting mesencephalic involvement may have been missed because of inappropriate imaging techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Strong evidence of unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarction</z:e> as a cause of VGP is still lacking </plain></SENT>
