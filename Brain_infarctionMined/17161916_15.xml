<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the expression of the TNF receptors, TNF-p55R and TNF-p75R, from 1 to 10 days following permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we observed that the relative level of TNF-p55R <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was significantly increased at 1-2 days and TNF-p75R <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was significantly increased at 1-10 days following <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp>, reaching peak values at 5 days, when microglial-macrophage CD11b <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was also increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In comparison, the relative level of TNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was significantly increased from 1 to 5 days, with peak levels 1 day after <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization revealed <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of both receptors in predominantly microglial- and macrophage-like cells in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and subsequently in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, and being most marked from 1 to 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using green fluorescent protein-bone marrow chimeric mice, we confirmed that TNF-p75R was expressed in resident microglia and blood-borne macrophages located in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> 1 and 5 days after <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp>, which was supported by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data show that increased expression of the TNF-p75 receptor following induction of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in mice can be attributed to expression in activated microglial cells and blood-borne macrophages </plain></SENT>
