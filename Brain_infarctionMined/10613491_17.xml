<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hypoglossal motoneurons, which innervate extrinsic and intrinsic muscles of the tongue, play a key role in maintaining the patency of the upper airway and in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on data obtained by using extracellular recording techniques, there is a consensus that hypoglossal motoneurons cease to discharge during rapid eye movement sleep, because they are disfacilitated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since other somatic motoneurons are known to be postsynaptically inhibited during rapid eye movement sleep, we sought to determine, by the use of intracellular recording techniques during cholinergically induced rapid eye movement sleep, whether postsynaptic inhibitory mechanisms act on hypoglossal motoneurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that, during this state, a powerful glycinergic premotor inhibitory system acts to suppress hypoglossal motoneurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding opens new avenues for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> syndrome, and provides a foundation to explore the neural and pharmacological control of respiration-related motoneurons during rapid eye movement sleep </plain></SENT>
