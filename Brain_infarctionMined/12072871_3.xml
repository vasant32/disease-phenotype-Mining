<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The 34Leu polymorphism of the factor XIII gene is associated with a low rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and a higher incidence of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effect of the polymorphism on the subsequent development of isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> and white matter disease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">preterm infants</z:e> with a birth weight &lt;1500 g (very <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> [VLBW] infants) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: We studied 531 VLBW infants and 301 control infants born at term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The factor XIII 34Leu polymorphism was detected by polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Allele frequencies were not different from term and VLBW infants (Val/Val, 53.1% and 57.8%; Val/Leu, 38.8% and 37.6%; Leu/Leu, 8.0% and 4.5%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VLBW infants carrying the Leu/Val or Leu/Leu allele had a significant reduced risk of the development of white matter disease (3.6% vs 10.4% in infants without the polymorphism, P =.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, only gestational age &lt;28 weeks (odds ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-7.5; P &lt;.001), and the factor XIII 34Leu allele (odds ratio, 0.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.1-0.7; P =.005) had significant prognostic value in predicting subsequent white matter disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, VLBW infants who carried the factor XIII 34Leu allele also had a moderately increased risk of the subsequent development of isolated <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> (14.3% vs 10.1% in infants without the mutation, P =.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: VLBW infants carrying the factor XIII 34Leu polymorphism had a decreased risk for white matter disorders </plain></SENT>
