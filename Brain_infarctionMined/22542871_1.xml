<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We here investigated the effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> on endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs) in vitro and in a rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary cultures of fetal rat NSCs were exposed to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> to characterize its effects on cell survival and proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To assess these effects in vivo, permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced in adult rats, treated systemically with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Imaging 7 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> comprised (i) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), assessing the extent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, (ii) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">Positron</z:chebi> Emission Tomography (PET) with [(11)C]PK11195, characterizing neuroinflammation, and (iii) PET with 3'-deoxy-3'-[(18)F]fluoro-L-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> ([(18)F]FLT), detecting proliferating endogenous NSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was used to verify ischemic damage and characterize cellular inflammatory and repair processes in more detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro, specific concentrations of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> significantly increased NSC numbers without increasing their proliferation, indicating a positive effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> on NSC survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vivo, endogenous NSC activation in the subventricular zone (SVZ) measured by [(18)F]FLT PET correlated well with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar to in vitro findings, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> led to a specific increase in endogenous NSC activity in both the SVZ as well as the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>[(11)C]PK11195 PET detected neuroinflammation in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core as well as in peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> regions, with both its extent and location independent of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The data did not reveal an effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced neuroinflammation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We show that multimodal PET imaging can be used to characterize and quantify complex cellular processes occurring after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, as well as their modulation by therapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We found <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi>, previously implied in attenuating microglial activation, to have positive effects on endogenous NSC survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings hold promise for the development of novel treatments in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
