<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess the value of non-invasive medical imaging for diagnosis of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and to study the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-one patients with a total of 62 carotid arteries were studied using Doppler ultrasound (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DUS</z:e>) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the 31 patients were studied using CT angiography (CTA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT and MRI of the brain were also done in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The imaging results in 5 patients were compared with those of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight patients with severe stenosis received carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The comparisons between the imaging results and pathological data were conducted in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 62 carotid arteries, mild stenosis was seen in 11, moderate in 14, severe in 21, obstructed in 4 and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 25 patients with severe stenosis or occlusion of carotid arteries, there were a total of 35 focal or multifocal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere, and 15 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on the contrary side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with the results of the operations, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DUS</z:e> correctly diagnosed 6 stenoses, while MRA identified 7 correctly and CTA 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Agreement on location of stenosis as performed by endarterectomy, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DUS</z:e>, MRA and CTA occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Histologically, areas of calcification and fibrousness were related to high densities on CTA, strong echoes on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DUS</z:e>, and low signal intensities on MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Relatively large amounts of necrotic material and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003651'>foam cells</z:hpo> filled with lipolytic materials on the intimal surface of arteries were observed during pathologically, corresponding to low and iso-densities on CTA, low echoes on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DUS</z:e>, and inhomogeneous signal intensities on MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A strong link exists between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The combined use of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DUS</z:e>, MRA and CTA can improve diagnostic accuracy for the assessment of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, as well as assist in ascertaining the nature of the plaque </plain></SENT>
