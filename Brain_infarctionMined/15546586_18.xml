<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used a model of cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> to produce unilateral damage in C57Bl/6 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lesion volume, ascertained by TTC staining, increased with longer durations of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi>, TUNEL, and FluoroJade staining showed a statistically significant increase in cellular damage in the ipsilateral cortex, CA1 pyramidal layer, and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus of ipsilateral hypoxic/ischemic tissue versus sham tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Astrocyte reactivity, determined by GFAP staining, was significantly higher in the ipsilateral H/I cortex and contralateral hippocampus compared to sham cortex and hippocampus, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased microglia activation was evident in the H/I-treated cortex and hippocampus versus sham cortex and hippocampus, particularly within areas undergoing degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To examine whether this model produces motor deficits, a battery of tests were administered before and after <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following 45 min H/I, locomotor activity, rotarod performance and performance on an inverted wire hang test were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the histological evidence of neuronal damage is consistent with functional deficits and suggest that this model may be useful for investigating strategies designed to protect neurons from <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced damage </plain></SENT>
