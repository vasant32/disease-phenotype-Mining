<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After being anesthetized, 7-day-old pups underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> followed by exposure to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pups were divided into 4 groups in order to receive the vehicle, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>, topiramate and combination of topiramate and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These were administered intraperitoneally for three times; the first before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the second after <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and the third 24 hours after the second dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After sacrification, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Percent infarcted brain volume was significantly reduced in rats which received drugs compared with those which received the vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of TUNEL positive cells per unit area in hippocampus and cortex were markedly reduced in drug treated groups compared with control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found regarding percent infarcted brain volume and number of TUNEL positive cells among drug-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">Melatonin</z:chebi> and topiramate, administered either alone or in combination significantly reduced the percent infarcted brain volume and number of TUNEL positive cells suggesting that these agents may confer benefit in treatment of infants with hypoxic-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
