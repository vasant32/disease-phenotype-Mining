<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: Isradipine, a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi>, provides consistent protection of the brain from injury and reduces neurological deficits produced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In these experiments, isradipine was utilized to cross-validate both the serial MRI measurement of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> with histology measurements and to validate a series of simple neurological deficit tests in order to establish a more rapid, higher throughput approach to screening compounds for utility in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with vehicle, or 2.5 or 5.0 mg/kg isradipine and middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T(2)-weighted MRI image analysis was compared to standard triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>-stained histological image analysis of brain sections to quantify isradipine neuroprotection 1, 3, and 30 days after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, serial evaluation (i.e. 1, 2, 5, 12, 20 and 30 days after MCAO) of four simple neurobehavioral tests were completed for each animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tests included assessment of hindlimb and forelimb function, and balance beam and proprioception performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 1, 3 and 30 days there was a significant positive correlation of the percent hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> for T(2)-weighted MRI and histology (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Practically identical isradipine dose-response neuroprotection curves were observed for both measurement procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Isradipine produced a dose-related reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> neurological deficits scored by the four neurological deficit tests (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, a significant time-related recovery from neurological deficits in vehicle-treated rats was observed (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The four different neurological deficit tests did provide unique time-related profiles of neurological recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study validates the use of serial MRI in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and establishes several simple neurological tests that can be used to measure neurological/behavioral deficits associated with brain injury and brain recovery of function over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Under these conditions, T(2)-weighted MRI and neurological testing required only about 10 min each per animal, thus providing rapid data collection and analysis and requiring reduced scientific personnel </plain></SENT>
