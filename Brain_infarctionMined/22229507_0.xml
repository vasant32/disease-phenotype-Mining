<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An increasing number of studies has indicated that hypoxic-ischemic-induced cerebral injury is partly mediated via <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent researches have focused on searching for drug and herbal manipulations to protect against hypoxic-ischemic-induced oxidative cell damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Scutellarin is a <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoid</z:chebi> derived from the Erigeron breviscapus (vant.) and has been reported to exhibit neuroprotective properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, its precise mechanism, particularly its antioxidation mechanism, remains elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of scutellarin on middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO)-induced brain damage in rats, and oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD)-induced toxicity in primary culture of rat cortical neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo, intraperitoneal injections of scutellarin (20 and 60 mg/kg) improved the neurological score and diminished the percentage of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the same time, scutellarin significantly increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) activities and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) level in ischemic brain tissues, enhancing endogenous <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, pretreatment of scutellarin (25, 50 and 100 Î¼M) protected neurons against lethal stimuli, decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells and inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in OGD-induced primary cortical neurons in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the preventive and therapeutic potential of scutellarin in cerebral injury patients is, at least in part, ascribed to augmentation of cellular <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> defense capacity </plain></SENT>
