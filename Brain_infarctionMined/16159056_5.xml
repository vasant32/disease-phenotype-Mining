<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SEPs were recorded intra-operatively in 76 patients with 79 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (8 in the posterior fossa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> ruptured during surgery, and 37 temporary clips were applied over an average of 8.1 minutes (range: 2-25 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 17 cases with complete loss of potential, 14 were associated with temporary clips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two losses were persistent with postoperative neurological deficit after 10 minutes of clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six showed incomplete recovery after a mean loss of 19.2 minutes following clipping of 9.3 minutes, resulting in a new deficit in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite complete recovery of potential in six patients after a 1 loss over 18.8 minutes following clipping of 10.7 minutes, four patients developed neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of SEPs in determining permanent neurological deficits was 57%, and the was specificity 88% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The duration of temporary clipping was significantly shorter in patients without resulting new neurological deficit (Mann-Whitney Test; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk of a new deficit was 30.7% in cases where less than 8 minutes of clipping was performed, and the risk was 80.9% when clipping exceeded 8 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The extent of recovery of potentials and the duration of SEP changes was strongly associated with the postoperative deficits (Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, p = 0.009; p = 0.001, Mann-Whitney Test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pathological p(ti)O2 measurements were obtained in 6 of 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In four patients, temporary occlusion was followed by a parallel alteration of SEPs and p(ti)O2 below 10 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is no genuinely safe permissible occlusion time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Despite complete recovery of SEPs after a loss of potential, the patient may develop new deficits </plain></SENT>
