<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Atherothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is the most frequent cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>; however, few reports have addressed the prognostic factors predicting early neurological deterioration (END) when the occlusive lesion is limited to the anterior main trunk, middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) or internal cerebral artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Between 2006 and 2008, 122 atherothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> patients were diagnosed with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> or ICA occlusive disease on magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score and the modified Alberta <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Program Early CT Score on diffusion-weighted imaging [ASPECTS-DW (modified)] were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical-DWI mismatch (CDM) was evaluated using NIHSS and the ASPECTS-DW (modified) to examine the predictive efficacy for early neurological deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen of 122 (14.8%) patients fulfilled the definition of CDM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>END was observed in 24 patients (19.7%) within 15 days after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CDM was observed in 14 cases in the END (+) group (14 of 24 cases, 58.3%) and 4 cases in the END (-) group (4 of 98 cases, 4.1%) (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that CDM was a significant predictive factor of END (odds ratio 26.68, p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CDM based on NIHSS and ASPECTS-DW (modified) could be a significant predictive factor for END of atherothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>/ICA </plain></SENT>
