<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Focal cerebral IR injury resulted significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and neurological deficits in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in various <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> like COX-2, iNOS, MMP-9, TNFα and IL-6 and massive apoptotic DNA fragmentation was also observed in the IR challenged brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GW1929 treatment significantly attenuated the neurological damage in focal cerebral IR injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotective effects of GW1929 were found to be associated with significant reduction in the COX-2, iNOS, MMP-9, TNFα and IL-6 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Together, we have also evaluated the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi>, a clinically available thiazolidinedione PPARγ <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, against focal cerebral IR injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Like GW1929, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> also showed beneficial effects in cerebral IR injury associated neurological damage but at the higher dose as compared to GW1929 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotective effects of PPARγ <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> were found to be associated with significant reduction in TUNEL positive cells in IR challenged brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, these results suggested the neuroprotective potential of PPARγ <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> in cerebral IR injury and these effects may be attributed to their anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic potential </plain></SENT>
