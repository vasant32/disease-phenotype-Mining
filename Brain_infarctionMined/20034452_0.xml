<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two experimental groups: middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> group (MCAO, n=8), and middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> plus acupuncture group (MCAO + Acu, n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Acupuncture stimulation was given immediately after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of its stimulation to both GB34 and GB39 on the size of the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and the functional status of the brain cells after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was examined by nissl staining and neuron-specific nuclear protein immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The infarction volume was significantly decreased in the MCAO + Acu group (16.4 +/- 4.8%), compared with the MCAO group (39.9 +/- 10.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of neuron-specific nuclear protein-positive cells in the MCAO group was significantly decreased by 42.3 +/- 12.6% in the striatum and by 45.8 +/- 5.8% in the motor cortex, but the neuron-specific nuclear protein-positive cells in the MCAO + Acu group were rescued by 67.0 +/- 3.8% in the striatum and by 68.1 +/- 4.5% in the motor cortex, compared with the contralateral side (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: This study showed that acupuncture had neuroprotective effects against focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
