<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A low concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> (10 microM) has been shown to reduce anoxic damage in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study examined the effect of low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in rats when administered before transient focal cerebral isehemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Wistar rats (weight, 280-340 g) were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi>, intubated, and mechanically ventilated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After surgical preparation, animals were assigned to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> 2-day (n = 10), vehicle 2-day (n 12), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> 7-day (n = 13), and vehicle 7-day (n = 14) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 1.5-mg/kg bolus dose of ildocaine was injected intravenously 30 mm before isehemia in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> 2-day and 7-day groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, an infusion was initiated at a rate of 2 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) until 60 min of reperfusion after isehemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to 90 min of focal cerebral isehemia using the intraluminal suture method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size was determined by image analysis of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>-stained sections at 48 h or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin-stained sections 7 days after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurologic outcome and body <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was significantly smaller in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> 2-day group (185.0+/-43.7 mm3) than in the vehicle 2-day group (261.3+/-45.8 mm3, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The reduction in the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> 7-day group (130.4+/-62.9 mm3) was also significant compared with the vehicle 7-day group (216.6+/-73.6 mm3, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After 7 days of reperfusion, the rats in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> group demonstrated better neurologic outcomes and less <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrated that a clinical anriarrhythmic dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi>, when given before and during transient focal cerebral isehemia, significantly reduced infaret size, improved neurologic outcome, and inhibited postisehemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
