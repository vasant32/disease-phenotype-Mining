<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is used to diagnose, to determine what treatment to use and to prognosticate cerebral blood flow after operation in super <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> period brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the beginning of the introduction, processing time and dosage for partial areas needed improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the possibility of shorter processing time and lower dosage of radiation with the help of improvement in the analysis software as well as a different scan method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two methods of reducing radiation dosage were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(1) The speed of X-ray rotation was slowed down; while <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> per image was maintained, total <z:chebi fb="6" ids="25427">mAs</z:chebi> was lowered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(2) Continuation scan was replaced by intermission one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analyzing time with older and newer version of analysis software was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The dosage was able to decrease by 25% as a result of the rotation speed slowed down; it became further less by 50% with the intermission scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Processing such as the vein extraction was automated by using new analysis software and successfully shorten the analysing time without damaging the reliability of analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We forecast that more clinical research on further lowering dosage and stabilization of analyzing will enable us to provide better information </plain></SENT>
