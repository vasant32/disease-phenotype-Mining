<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The following observations were made: (1) In mild cases with slight <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> but without disturbance of consciousness (Group I), cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> in peripheral venous plasma (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53245">PVP</z:chebi>) remained over the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lowest level more than 10 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with apparent neurological deficits could be divided into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one group, cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53245">PVP</z:chebi> decreased to a subnormal level within about 5 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (Group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In another group (Group III), such a decrease was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain isotope scintigrams were revealed negative in Group I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The size of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> as judged by isotope uptake was larger in Group III than in Group II, except for a few cases in which the lesion was restricted in the basal ganglionic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(2) No clinical significance was, however, found in the time course of cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> levels in internal jugular venous or femoral arterial plasma, or in cerebrospinal fluid, or of the daily amount of cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> excretion into urine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(3) Cerebral arterio-venous difference of cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> was negative in most of the cases </plain></SENT>
