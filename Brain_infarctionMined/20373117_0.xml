<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The incidence and causes of perioperative ischemic complications in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were retrospectively examined by reviewing 165 surgically treated adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two hundred forty-six revascularization procedures were performed in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 19 (7.7%) perioperative ischemic complications (four infarctions with neurological sequelae and 15 reversible ischemic neurological deficits with a new lesion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The complications occurred in the initially affected hemispheres in 17 (89.4%) of the 19 ischemic complications, regardless of the side of the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple ischemic episodes (defined as over four-symptom episodes before treatment), the presence of a preoperative low density area (LDA) on computed tomographic (CT) scanning, and a high signal intensity on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging were significantly correlated with perioperative ischemic complications (p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.05, and p &lt; 0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Non-surgical hemodynamic risk factors, i.e., <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011106'>hypovolemia</z:hpo>, were noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the 19 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the surgical factors evaluated were associated with the complications identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Avoidance of non-surgical hemodynamic risk factors as well as maintaining vital collateral vessels is essential for the prevention of perioperative hemodynamic brain damage in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, very close monitoring of the perioperative care of patients with preoperative multiple ischemic episodes and an LDA or high signal intensity on preoperative CT or diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging is extremely important </plain></SENT>
