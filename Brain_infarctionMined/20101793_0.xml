<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There are presently reports on elevated levels of cardiac troponins in patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this investigation was to study the diagnostic value of increased blood cardiac troponin T levels in patients without its clinical picture and ECG changes characteristic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study covered 72 patients (48 males and 24 females) aged 54 to 87 years (mean 69.8 +/- 11.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The inclusion criteria were increased cardiac troponin T; the main exclusion criteria were <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>-typical anginal pain and characteristic ECG changes (ST-segment elevation, the appearance of pathological Q waves) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The final diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> was established in only 29 (40.3%) patients; the other 43 patients were diagnosed as having the following diseases: septic state in 21; oncopathology in 10; diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> in 6; brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in 4; and <z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi> deficiency <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In dead patients, the level of troponin T was significantly higher than that in discharged patients, respective of the underlying disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a direct correlation between the cardiac troponin T levels and the SAPS II index that reflected the severity of a patient's general condition (r = 0.44; p = 0.0001) and an inverse correlation between the cardiac troponin level and the left ventricular ejection fraction (r = -0.45; p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, despite the cardiospecificity of troponin T, its detection in the blood of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> patients without other manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> is not a specific symptom of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>, but it is suggestive of the severity of the disease, probably with the involvement of the myocardium into the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
