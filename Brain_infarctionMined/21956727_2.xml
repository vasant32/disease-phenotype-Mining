<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Cerebral microbleeds (MBs) are an important indicator of cerebral small-vessel disease, and their prevalence increases with increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the functional consequences of MBs in the aging population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated whether the presence and location of MBs are associated with cognition in the PROSPER study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For 439 subjects the number and location (cortico-subcortical, deep white matter, basal ganglia, and infratentorial) of the MBs was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Difference in cognitive performance between subjects with and without MBs was calculated by entering the variables sex, age, white matter hyperintensity volume, infarction, and MBs in a linear mixed model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences in cognition between subjects with and without one or more MBs at different anatomic locations were assessed using the same model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that after correction for sex, age, white matter hyperintensity volume, and infarction, subjects with infratentorial MBs had a significantly lower score on the Immediate Picture-Word Learning test, Delayed Picture-Word Learning, and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that in elderly individuals at increased vascular risk, infratentorial MBs are associated with loss in cognitive functioning </plain></SENT>
