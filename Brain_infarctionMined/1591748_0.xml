<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>Hemiparesis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> were the main clinical presentations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two-thirds of the patients had brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The degree of cerebral and ventricular asymmetry was evaluated by ratios obtained by linear measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into two groups according to the index of maximal asymmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and the width of the cerebral ventricles did not differ in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This may be due to the fact that most of our patients suffered from perinatal insult to the brain, allowing time for remodeling and plastic changes to occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The use of measurable structural parameters in craniocerebral asymmetry offers a basis for comparable radiological assessment </plain></SENT>
