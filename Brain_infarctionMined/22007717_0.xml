<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The individual is a 43-year-old male who sustained an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> of the right thalamus 2 days prior to inpatient rehabilitation admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Observational gait analysis and the upright motor control test isolated the primary gait deficit as left hip and ankle extension in the stance phase of gait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physical therapy interventions focused on specific functional tasks that challenged hip extension so that he could resume the activities in which he engaged prior to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a 3 week length of stay in inpatient rehabilitation, the individual demonstrated an improvement in the outcome measures, functional progression with ambulation (level and stairs), and transfers sufficient to be discharged home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This case illustrates how standardized outcome measures assisted the clinician in isolating the gait impairments that limited his ability to ambulate within his home environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the plan of care and physical therapy interventions focused on these deficits to maximize the functional outcomes </plain></SENT>
