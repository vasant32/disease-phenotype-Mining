<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>Hypoxia</z:mp>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (H/I) induces rapid and massive brain damage in neonatal rat brain, resulting in long-term consequences on structural and functional maturation of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>Inflammatory mediators</z:mp> contribute to these permanent pathological changes, which are sensitive to corticoid treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the chemokine receptor CXCR4, specific for the SDF-1 alpha/CXCL12 ligand, regulates both apoptotic and neuroregeneration processes, this receptor was quantified 2 days following H/I in neonatal rat brain in relation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (DEX) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven-day-old male rats were exposed to a 90-min <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> following unilateral carotid ligation (H/I) and were sacrificed 48 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">Glucocorticoid</z:chebi>-pretreated animals were injected subcutaneously 5 h prior to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> with 0.5 microg/g DEX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Glial fibrillary acidic protein and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi> staining were used for assessing the extent of brain lesion subdivided into necrotic and penumbra-like areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The density of CXCR4 receptors was determined by quantitative autoradiography using [(125)I]SDF-1 alpha as a ligand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The H/I resulted in a massive lesion ipsilateral to the carotid ligation, which was extended to cortical, striatal, hippocampal and thalamic areas, while the contralateral hemisphere remained apparently unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DEX decreased the lesion size by reducing mainly the necrotic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>H/I induced a marked increase in CXCR4 receptor binding in the penumbra-like areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DEX pretreatment decreased CXCR4 receptor density in the penumbra and attenuated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002446'>astrocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, DEX strongly lowered mortality rate and reduced functional recovery time right after <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The rapid enhancement in CXCR4 chemokine receptor binding in the affected brain areas suggests that SDF-1 alpha/CXCR4 may play a role in the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-induced inflammatory reaction in the neonatal brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Attenuation of CXCR4 expression and <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> could contribute to the neuroprotective effect of DEX pretreatment via influencing the inflammatory cascade induced by H/I in the neonatal brain </plain></SENT>
