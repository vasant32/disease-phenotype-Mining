<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, astrocytes establish a glial network and communicate through gap junctions in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Connexin 43 (Cx43) is one of major component proteins in astrocytic gap junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Heterozygote Cx43 KO mice and astrocyte specific Cx43 KO mice exhibited amplified brain damage after ischemic insults, suggesting a neuroprotective role for astrocytic gap junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, some reports mentioned unfavorable effects of gap junctions in neuronal support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the role of astrocytic gap junctions under ischemic condition remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since these studies have been performed using animal models, we investigated the Cx43 expression in human brain after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain slice sections were prepared from pathological samples in our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> brains sectioned because of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were considered as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multiple infarction brains sectioned because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were considered as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We observed the levels of Cx43 in both lesioned and intact areas, and compared them with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As the results, astrocytes were strongly activated in penumbral lesions both of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ischemic models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The Cx43 immunoreactivity was significantly amplified in the penumbra of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> model compared to that of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Neurons were well preserved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> model compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that the brain may generate neuronal protection by increasing the levels of Cx43 and amplifying the astrocytic gap junctional intercellular communication under hypoxic condition </plain></SENT>
