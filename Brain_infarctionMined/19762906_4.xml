<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical and imaging outcome were studied after IV-tPA treatment based on MRI criteria in patients with minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were analysed retrospectively of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score &lt;4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were studied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> MRI including perfusion and diffusion weighted imaging (PWI and DWI) and treated with IV-tPA for &lt; or =6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was delineated on follow-up MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was assessed after 90 days using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six patients with a median NIHSS on admission of 2 (range 0-3) were treated with IV-tPA based on MRI criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was detected (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branch n = 2, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> trunk n = 3, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> trifurcation n = 1), and the PWI lesion (41, 25-60 ml) exceeded the DWI lesion (4, 1-23 ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was 9 (2-29) ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Favourable outcome (mRS 0-1) was seen in 5/6 patients and independent outcome (mRS = 2) in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No intracerebral haemorrhages occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Treatment with IV-tPA based on MRI criteria was safe and appeared to be effective in this small series of patients with minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
