<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have suggested that increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> plays an important role in recovery of function after brain injury; however, the majority of these studies used drugs that are known to also affect other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25375">monoamines</z:chebi> to increase or decrease <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to determine if <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> is required to promote recovery after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A form of enriched rehabilitation was used to rehabilitate animals after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and the neurotoxin N-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47553">2-chloroethyl</z:chebi>)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine was used to selectively destroy <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> projections from the locus coeruleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three sensorimotor tests were used to evaluate the recovery of the animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>Depletion</z:mpath> of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> improved sensorimotor recovery in standard-housed animals and did not impede recovery in the rehabilitation groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">Dopamine</z:chebi> beta hydroxylase staining was used to confirm N-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47553">2-chloroethyl</z:chebi>)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine-depleted terminal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The amount of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> terminal staining negatively correlated with recovery of function in the staircase test after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, enriched rehabilitation increased, but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> had no effect on, brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein levels, which have also been linked to improved recovery of function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together the above findings question the previously postulated role of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> in recovery of function after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
