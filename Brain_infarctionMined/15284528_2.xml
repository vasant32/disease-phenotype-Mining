<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe a rare positional occlusion/stasis of vertebral arteries, which resolved following application of cervical traction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The likely mechanism of above findings is proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar insufficiency</z:e> with changes in head position in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> can result from a number of causes; however, bilateral compromise of vertebral arteries during head extension had been described only once </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is no report of vertebral artery angiogram in any individual following application of traction and relief of compromise in extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 45-year-old man had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> for the last 10 years and presented with symptoms of posterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cervical spine radiographs revealed "mobile" <z:hpo ids='HP_0003414'>atlantoaxial dislocation</z:hpo> and atlantoaxial impaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed odontoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath>, lateral masses destruction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003414'>atlantoaxial dislocation</z:hpo>, and atlantoaxial impaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Angiogram showed occlusion of the left vertebral artery and transient stasis of the right vertebral artery distal to foramen transversarium of C2 vertebra in extension position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The left vertebral artery had narrowing in the same segment in the neutral position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Following traction, repeat angiogram showed no occlusion or narrowing of either vertebral artery in any position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Transoral odontoidectomy and occipitocervical fusion were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patient had no fresh deficits following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We described a rare case of positional occlusion/stasis of vertebral arteries associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, in which angiography following cervical traction showed complete resolution </plain></SENT>
