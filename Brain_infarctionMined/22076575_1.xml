<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The function of Epigallocatechin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16918">gallate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi>), a main component of green tea, has been widely investigated, amelioration of synaptic transmission and neuroprotective effects against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced brain damage among others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism underlying is still unveiled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> on high frequency stimulation-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> injury induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in vivo to examine the possible relations between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> and synaptic transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> modulated synaptic transmission and produced a dose-dependent improvement of the induction of LTP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, relative high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> can block the induction of LTP at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rat in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> were observed on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological deficit in rats subjected to MCAO; furthermore, the cell viability of primary cultured rat hippocampal and cortical neurons suffered from oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation were evaluated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> and LDH assay, which showed significant neuroprotective properties in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the contents of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> (Glu), glycine (Gly), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi> amino acids were totally disequilibrated before and after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> injury and could be rebalanced to original level by application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> is able to improve the efficiency of synaptic transmission in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> injury with attenuated effect related to the neuroprotection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> through regulating excitatory and inhibitory amino acid balance </plain></SENT>
