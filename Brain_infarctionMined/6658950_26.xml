<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed the clinical features of 56 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and NVAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on clinical criteria, 35 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (63%) were classified as probably embolic, 13 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (23%) as probably nonembolic and 8 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (14%) as of indeterminate pathogenesis </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five additional patients experienced probable brain or systemic emboli within the 11 days prior to the marker <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Including these patients, 20% (8 of 40) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NVAF patients who were not immediately anticoagulated experienced recurrent embolism within 11 days of the initial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
