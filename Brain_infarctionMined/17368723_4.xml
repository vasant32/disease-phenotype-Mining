<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A growing body of evidence suggests that heparanase serves multiple functions in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues including the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we showed that heparanase is expressed in reactive astrocytes in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> lesion of a rat brain whose middle cerebral artery was transiently occluded for 90 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR and Western blot analyses revealed that heparanase expression was markedly upregulated during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (from 3 to 7 days post-reperfusion (dpr)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As revealed by immunohistochemical study, heparanase was localized in astrocytes located in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Heparanase+ astrocytes expressed nestin that is known as a marker of reactive astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Infiltrated neutrophils were weakly heparanase+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 7 dpr, the expression level of heparanase+ astrocytes considerably decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the maximum expression of heparanase by astrocytes may correlate with the time of migration of reactive astrocytes toward the ischemic core, which may result in <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a novel role of heparanase in the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
