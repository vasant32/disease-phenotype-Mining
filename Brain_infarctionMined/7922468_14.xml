<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>From a prospective registry of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive patients with a supratentorial ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, those with a compatible CT lesion were selected to study topographical relationship, clinical syndrome, vascular risk factors, signs of large-vessel disease or cardiogenic embolism, and mortality in cases with an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the anterior choroidal artery (AChA) territory in comparison with other <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>First we identified the area supplied by the AChA: in accordance with the consensus in the literature the posterior two-thirds of the posterior leg of the internal capsule was considered as certain AChA territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After reviewing CT scans, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> presumed small deep AChA territory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were displayed in a schematic composite picture of super-imposed areas of infarction in different shades of grey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> that were located largely outside the generally included territory were presumed to belong to a different vascular territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, 77 small deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were considered to be located within, and 83 outside the AChA territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine AChA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> extended from the internal capsule upwards into the posterior paraventricular <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the composite representation of 26 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> restricted to the posterior part of the paraventricular <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata region showed almost complete overlap with the area occupied by AChA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> that extended upwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We therefore concluded that the posterior paraventricular area is most likely supplied by the AChA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of a clinical lacunar or a cortical syndrome did not differ between small deep AChA and remaining small deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comparison of vascular risk factors by way of multivariate regression analysis only showed that a significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> was more frequent (adjusted odds ratio 8.87; 95% confidence interval 1.44-54.50), and a cardioembolic source was less frequent (odds ratio 0.24; 95% confidence interval 0.07-0.92) in AChA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> than in the other small deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>Carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e> were less frequent in AChA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> than in superficial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (odds ratio 0.33, 0.23, respectively; 95% confidence interval 0.15-0.74, 0.09-0.52, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One month and one year mortality were lower in small deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> compared with superficial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, but most favourable in the AChA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, this was probably related to younger age in the AChA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Larger AChA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were infrequent in our series; six of such cases did not differ in any respect from superficial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the posterior paraventricular <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata region is most likely supplied by the AChA, and that AChA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> do not constitute a separate brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> entity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
