<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Possible auditory deficits in neglect were examined by comparing the performance of four right brain-damaged (RBD) patients with left visuospatial neglect, versus four RBD patients without neglect, in three auditory tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first task required speeded discrimination of sound elevation, by moving a central lever up or down according to the vertical position of a peripheral target sound, regardless of its side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The other two auditory tasks were non-spatial, requiring either speeded pitch discrimination (moving the central lever up for high pitch, down for low pitch) or speeded target detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neglect patients' performance was impaired with respect to RBD controls only when the auditory task required spatial coding of the target sound (the up/down spatial discrimination) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This demonstrates a selective deficit of auditory space perception in neglect patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This auditory spatial deficit was more pronounced for left than right sounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since auditory space perception was impaired in the vertical dimension, the observed deficit cannot be attributed to a systematic rightward shift in sound localisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Instead, the results suggest increased spatial uncertainty in sound localisation by neglect patients, particularly for auditory targets on the contralesional side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings are related to multimodal coding of space in the parietal cortex, which was damaged in the neglect patients, but not in the RBD controls </plain></SENT>
