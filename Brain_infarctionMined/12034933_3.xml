<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine whether a proximal (M1-segment) or distal (M2- and/or M3-segment) hyperattenuating middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) sign in patients with ischemic infarction in the territory of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> indicates a worse short-term prognosis than that in patients without a hyperattenuating <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 352 patients who were diagnosed with ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in the territory of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 186 patients met our final criteria and were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nonenhanced computed tomography (CT) was performed for the entire brain, with a 5-mm section thickness in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, within 24 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence and location of a hyperattenuating <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> sign was correlated with neurologic deficit at discharge from the hospital (ie, short-term prognosis) by using the chi(2) test to detect differences between patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with a hyperattenuating <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> sign at CT have a worse short-term prognosis than do patients without a hyperattenuating <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> sign (P &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with a proximal hyperattenuating <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> sign have a significantly (P &lt;.01) worse short-term prognosis than do patients with a distal hyperattenuating <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A proximal hyperattenuating <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> sign is a reliable predictor of poor short-term prognosis in patients who experience <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
