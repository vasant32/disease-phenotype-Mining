<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lecticans are developmentally regulated in formative white matter and exert growth-inhibitory effects in several adult injury models, yet little is known regarding their role in neonatal H-I injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main objectives of this study were to examine the expression profiles of brevican and versican in rat using a standard H-I model and to determine whether altered expression was associated with distinct components of white and gray matter pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The H-I procedure in postnatal day 7 rats produced progressive injury limited to the ipsilateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">Cresyl violet</z:chebi> staining revealed severe cavitary infarctions at 14 and 21 days that were absent at 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cellular damage, as measured by glial fibrillary acidic protein and fractin immunoreactivity, occurred in cortical and subcortical gray matter at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>O4 sulfatide immunoreactivity was reduced in the external capsule, hippocampal fimbria, and corpus striatum at 4 days relative to that contralaterally, suggesting the loss of preoligodendrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brevican expression was reduced in the cortex and hippocampus at 4 days but was markedly elevated at later end points, localizing to regions of cellular damage both in and proximal to the lesion core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, versican was reduced in the external capsule 4 days after H-I, a reduction that was sustained up to 21 days in white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate unique expression profiles for lecticans after neonatal H-I, suggesting brevican deposition is elevated in response to progressive gray matter injury, whereas diminished versican expression may be associated with deep cerebral white matter injury </plain></SENT>
