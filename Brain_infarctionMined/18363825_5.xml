<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Many practical therapies have been explored as clinical applications for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262005" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemic cerebral infarction</z:e>; however, most are still insufficient to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We show here a potential combination therapy in a rat focal ischemic model to improve neurological symptoms as well as to reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes at the maximum level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We applied protein transduction technology using artificial anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> Bcl-xl derivative with three amino acid-substitutions (Y22F, Q26N and R165K) (FNK) protein fused with a protein-transduction-domain <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTD</z:e>-FNK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTD</z:e>-FNK was administrated 1 h after initiating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> followed by the administration of an <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi> FK506 with a 30-min time lag, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes of the total brain and cortex were markedly reduced to 27% and 14%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This procedure not only reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, but also markedly improved neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic effect continued for at least 1 week after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FK506 inhibited the transduction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTD</z:e>-FNK in vitro, which explains the requirement of a time lag for the administration of FK506 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An additional in vitro experiment showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTD</z:e>-FNK, when administered 30 min before FK506, gave the maximal protective effect by reducing the intracellular calcium concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose that this combination therapy would provide a synergistic protective effect by both drugs, reducing adverse the effects of FK506 </plain></SENT>
