<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred seventy-seven patients were tracked for a mean of 8.9 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Documented events comprise the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and the occurrence of vascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The predictors for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and vascular events were separately evaluated by Cox proportional hazards analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-six patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (0.17/100 patient-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Male sex (relative risk [RR], 4.2; 95% CI, 1.2 to 14.7), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (RR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.0 to 8.5), confluent DWML (moderate: RR, 7.1; 95% CI, 1.6 to 31.5; severe: RR, 35.8; 95% CI, 7.2 to 177.3), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695689" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nondipping</z:e> status (RR, 7.1; 95% CI, 2.2 to 22.0) were independent predictors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-six patients suffered from vascular events (3.11/100 patient-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (RR, 5.7; 95% CI, 2.7 to 11.9), multiple lacunae (moderate: RR, 6.4; 95% CI, 2.5 to 15.8; severe: RR, 8.5; 95% CI, 3.1 to 23.3), and high 24-hour systolic blood pressure (&gt;145 mm Hg versus &lt;130 mm Hg) (RR, 10.3; 95% CI, 1.3 to 81.3) were independent predictors for vascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Predictors for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and vascular events appear to differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Male sex, confluent diffuse white matter lesions, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695689" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nondipping</z:e> status were independent predictors for subsequent development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, multiple lacunae, and high 24-hour systolic blood pressure were independent predictors for vascular events </plain></SENT>
