<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In both cats, physical examination and routine blood tests were unremarkable, as was routine analysis of cerebrospinal fluid obtained from the DSH cat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features - focal wedge-shaped lesion in the cerebellum characterised by hyperintensity in T2-weighted, T2( *)-gradient echo and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images - a presumptive diagnosis of cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was made in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the DSH cat, the post-mortem examination confirmed the diagnosis of cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and additionally found <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> renal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and a pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the Siamese cat, ultrasonographic evaluation of the heart revealed a probable low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> valvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> which was thought to be a potential source of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This paper describes the first two cases - one confirmed and the other suspected - of cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the cat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The in vivo potential diagnostic value of the MRI study is highlighted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> should be included in the differential diagnosis of cat with a peracute <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001317'>cerebellar signs</z:hpo> regardless of the severity of neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
