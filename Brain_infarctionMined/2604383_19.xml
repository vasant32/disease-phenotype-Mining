<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings strongly support the view that (1) except for in situ <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, pial artery territorial infarctions are indicative of an embolic mechanism, and (2) that the mechanism underlying lacunes is hardly, if ever, embolic </plain></SENT>
