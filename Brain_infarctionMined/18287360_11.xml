<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the in vivo effects of red wine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26195">polyphenol</z:chebi> compounds (RWPC) in rats that were submitted to middle <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596298" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral occlusion</z:e> as an experimental model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats were given RWPC [30 mg/(kg x d) dissolved in drinking water] or water for 1 wk before being subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sham-operated rats were subjected to transient occlusion in which the filament was not completely introduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The release of amino acids and energy metabolites were monitored by intracerebral microdialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The volume of the ischemic lesion was assessed 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proteomic analysis of brain tissue was performed to study the effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and RWPC on specific protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with RWPC completely prevented the burst of excitatory amino acids that occurred in response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in untreated rats and significantly reduced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rats chronically treated with RWPC, however, had lower basal concentrations of energy metabolites, including <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> in the brain parenchyma, compared with untreated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> RWPC treatment significantly enhanced the residual cerebral blood flow during occlusion and reperfusion in rats subjected to transient occlusion compared with untreated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This effect resulted from arterial vasodilatation, as the internal diameters of several arteries were significantly enlarged after RWPC treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Proteomic studies revealed the modulation by RWPC of the expression of proteins involved in the maintenance of neuronal caliber and axon formation, in the protection against <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, and in energy metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings provide an experimental basis for the beneficial effects of RWPC on the neurovascular unit during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
