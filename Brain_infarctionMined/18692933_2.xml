<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the influence of the reciprocal association between serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (sICAM-1) on the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred seventy nine middle-aged and elderly diabetic patients without histories of cardiovascular events were followed up for an average of 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients developed symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (BI) during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients had significantly higher blood pressure, longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, microvascular complications such as macroalbuminuria, and higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, sICAM-1 and hs-CRP levels at baseline as compared with those without BI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was observed in patients with high levels of sICAM-1 (&gt;260microg/L) and hs-CRP (&gt;0.83mg/L) at baseline, respectively, and patients with high levels of both were more likely to develop BI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, sICAM-1 levels were significantly correlated with systolic blood pressure and glycemic control index, whereas hs-CRP levels were correlated with fasting insulin levels, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consequently, sICAM-1 and hs-CRP levels were, respectively, reflected in different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that both measurements of hs-CRP and sICAM-1 levels are useful as a predictor of future <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
