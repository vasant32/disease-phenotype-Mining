<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Although hyperhomocyst(e)inemia had been proven to be a potent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, it is still controversial which subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is associated with hyperhomocyst(e)inemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to clarify the association between plasma homocyst(e)ine (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi>) levels and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes according to TOAST classifications based on MRI findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively recruited 124 consecutive first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients hospitalized in Toride Kyodo General Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each patient underwent brain MRI including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and was evaluated for total plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> levels in addition to routine laboratory tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 93 patients enrolled in this study, 19 were subtyped with large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> [LA-AMBI(+)], 13 with LA-AMBI(-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with LA-AMBI(+) showed significantly higher plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> levels than those with LA-AMBI(-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, for LA-AMBI, the plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> level was associated with an OR of 1.3 (95% CI 1.06-1.71, P=0.017) per 1 mumol increase in concentration, and 1.4 (95% CI 1.04-1.77, P=0.025) after adjustment for age, sex and serum cholesterol levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the subset of patients with LA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, those with high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> levels are more likely to have AMBI than those without elevated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> levels possibly due to plaque instability </plain></SENT>
