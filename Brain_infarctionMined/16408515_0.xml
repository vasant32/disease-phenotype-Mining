<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate by cross-sectional study in elderly people having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> whether those carotid parameters are markers for atherothrombotic infarction (AI) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (LI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects of this study were 314 patients aged 65 years or older who had controlled <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and assessed carotid artery by ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were categorized into control, AI and LI group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical characteristics (biochemical analysis, body mass index, systolic/diastolic blood pressure, smoking habits, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy) and carotid parameters (maximum intima-media thickness (Max-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>), plaque score (PLQ-S) and Maximum pulsatility index (Max-PI)) were compared among three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PLQ-S, Max-PI, frequency of PLQ-S &gt; or = 10mm and frequency of Max-PI &gt; or = 2.0 in the AI group were significantly higher than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between control and LI group concerning those carotid parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that there were significant correlations between AI and PLQ-S &gt; or = 10mm (odds ratio 2.980; P = 0.011), AI and Max-PI &gt; or = 2.0 (odds ratio 2.458; P = 0.038), but there was no significant correlation between those carotid parameters and LI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study suggests that in high risk elderly people, PLQ-S and PI are better markers for AI than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>, but those carotid parameters have poor associations with LI </plain></SENT>
