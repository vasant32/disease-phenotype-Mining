<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are a lot of drugs that are in experimental stage for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among them are <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> (CCBs) that have, in animal models, different effectiveness in healing of ischemic damage in brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mechanism of CCBs' action in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is still unclear, but antioxidative property is supposed to be implicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated antioxidative and neuroprotective properties of two CCBs, azelnidipine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Wistar Kyoto rats were subjected to 90 min of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) by a nylon thread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals were divided into 3 groups, vehicle, azelnidipine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the azelnidipine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> groups, rats were treated with azelnidipine (1 mg/kg) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> (1 mg/kg) by gastric gavage for 2 weeks before MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vehicle group was treated by solution of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53448">methyl cellulose</z:chebi> for 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rats were killed 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Physiological parameters (mean arterial pressure, heart rate, body weight), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> index, cerebral blood flow (CBF), <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> markers which are HEL, 4-HNE, AGE and 8-OHdG, and evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by TUNEL, were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences among groups in mean arterial pressure, heart rate and body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Treatment with azelnidipine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Azelnidipine treated group showed more marked reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was no attenuation of CBF in CCBs groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The number of HEL, 4-HNE, AGE and 8-OHdG positive cells were significantly decreased in the CCBs treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These molecules were again fewer in the azelnidipine group than in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In TUNEL staining, the numbers of positive cells was smaller in the CCBs treated groups, especially in the azelnidipine group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment of azelnidipine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> had a neuroprotective effect in ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Antioxidative property is one of the important profiles of CCBs that is implicated in brain protection </plain></SENT>
