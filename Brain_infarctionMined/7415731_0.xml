<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An analysis of the results obtained has shown that the immunological reactivity increases from the very first day of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors believe that the early immunological response, especially in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, is due to development of the cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in a sensitized body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A rise of selective antibody titres depending on the character of the cerebrovascular disorder was noted: there were: anti-encephalic antibodies targeted at the malacia focus in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, and antivascular, and to a lesser extent anti-encephalic antibodies in cases of a hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The informative value of the complement fixation test was found to be greater than that of the hemagglutination inhibition test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High degrees of plasmatization of the splenic tissue and the presence of the anti-encephalic immune complexes in it, mainly in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, also point to the activity of the immunogenesis in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of the cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
