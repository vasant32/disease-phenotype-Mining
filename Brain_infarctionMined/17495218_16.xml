<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To characterize different forms of intracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissections</z:e> (IADs), and to test the assumption that IADs are frequently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) and poor outcome, and that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy is contraindicated in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 81 consecutive non-SAH IAD patients and 22 IAD patients with SAH, diagnosed between 1994 and 2004 and 1998 and 2004, respectively, and treated the former patients immediately with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, followed with at least 3 months of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were recorded at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Approximately one-third of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cervicocephalic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissections</z:e> were identifiably either completely located intracranially or extended into the intracranial space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 3 months, 64 of the 81 non-SAH patients (79%) had a favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale, 0 to 2); 1 patient died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> developed during follow-up in the non-SAH group, and no <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> was observed during <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Those presenting with SAH formed approximately 25% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> IADs, and 21 cases out of 22 (95%) were associated with ruptured fusiform dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This latter group displayed significantly worse outcomes: 7 died, and only 7 had modified Rankin Scale 0 to 2 at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide important information for clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IADs appear to polarize into 2 groups: (1) nonaneurysmatic IADs presenting without SAH that are associated with favorable outcomes and safe <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy; and (2) aneurysmatic IADs, characterized by SAH and poorer prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Literature on IADs may have been biased toward group 2 </plain></SENT>
