<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To examine whether total serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (tHcy) in a population-based sample of middle-aged women is an independent risk factor for presence of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (LIs) 24 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective population study, follow-up time 24 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Gothenburg, an urban area in western Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred twenty-six women, 89.6% of the original study sample of the Population Study of Women in Gothenburg, aged 46 to 60 at baseline in 1968/69 and re-examined at age 70 to 84 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: After 24 years of follow-up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects underwent a psychiatric examination, and 277 computerized tomography (CT) scans of the brain were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two radiologists assessed LIs and white matter lesions (WMLs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline serum tHcy was analyzed from frozen stored serum samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analyses were performed controlling for potential confounders such as age and selected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-four subjects had LIs in 1992 (12.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the full multivariate-adjusted stepwise model, LIs were associated with elevated tHcy (odds ratio (OR)=1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.01-1.17 per micromol/L of tHcy increment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Women with tHcy values in the highest tertile were almost three times as likely to have LIs (OR=2.82, 95% CI=1.34-5.93) as were those in the lowest tertile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>tHcy was not related to WMLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Subjects who did not undergo a CT scan did not differ from those who did regarding tHcy or any of the covariates studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: tHcy in middle-aged women is an independent risk factor for LIs, but not WMLs, as observed using CT later in life </plain></SENT>
