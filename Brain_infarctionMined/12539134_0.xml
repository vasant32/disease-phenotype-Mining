<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiograms of 16 patients, ranging from 54 to 85 years old, admitted for rehabilitation after an ischemic supratentorial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> without a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> or rhythm disturbances, were recorded during physiotherapy effort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were evaluated for the functional independence measure (FIM) score 48 to 72 hours following admission and repeated at one week before discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The heart rate variability (HRV) parameters: standard deviation (SD) of the RR series, the power spectrum of the RR intervals for the low frequency range (LF: 0.04-0.15 Hz), and the high frequency range (HF: 0.15-0.4 Hz) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> heart rate variability parameters had statistically significant relationship with the FIM on admission and discharge scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the HRV parameters correlate with the clinical measures of function: the greater the HRV parameter the higher the FIM score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presented technique may prove useful as a prognostic tool providing a simple way for determining functional performance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
