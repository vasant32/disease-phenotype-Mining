<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been reported that UCP2 and UCP5 might reduce free radical stress in the ischemic condition in in vitro models, suggesting both as potential neuroprotective agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the levels of UCP2 and UCP5 expression in the lesion of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain slice sections were prepared from pathological samples collected at our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> brains sectioned because of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n = 5) and multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> with several <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> episodes (n = 4) were selected for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed the amount of UCP2 and UCP5 expression in both lesioned and intact areas, and compared them between embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and multiple infarction cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the expression of UCP2 and UCP5 was significantly elevated in the ischemic lesions compared to the intact area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>UCP5 expression in the lesions was higher in multiple infarction cases than in embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, brains may respond to neuroprotection through the increased expression of UCP2 and UCP5 under ischemic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, UCP5 may respond to repetitive ischemic stresses or have a long-term effect </plain></SENT>
