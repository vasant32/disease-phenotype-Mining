<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Types of initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the racial differences in study samples are among the explanations that may account for this inconsistency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to estimate the cumulative recurrence rates of noncardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and identify the factors that influence the first recurrence of noncardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the Taiwanese Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four hundred and sixty-six patients with noncardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> from thirteen hospitals in Taiwan were followed up in this study to ascertain first recurrence of noncardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> between October 1992 and April 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the cumulative recurrence rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Cox regression model was used to ascertain the significant factors affecting the first recurrence of noncardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall cumulative recurrence rate was 10.5% (49/466) from the follow-up period of 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, sex, treatment modes, and variables pertinent to blood pressure, the site of brain lesion remained a significant factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relative risk of first recurrence for the basal ganglion vs. the region of middle cerebral artery was 3.06 (95% CI: 1.29-7.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The brain lesion site was demonstrated to be an independent predictor of risk for the first recurrence of noncardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> among the Taiwanese Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Whether this finding was also seen in other populations should be corroborated in future research </plain></SENT>
