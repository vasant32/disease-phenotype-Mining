<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Experimental and clinical studies have shown that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262385" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic imbalance</z:e> is associated with morbidity and mortality due to global ischemic brain injury following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> (CA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although hypoxic-preconditioning (HP) has shown promising neuro-protection in the subsequent ischemic brain injury, the underlying mechanisms and its influence on autonomic regulation have not yet well-understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we utilized baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) to investigate the protective effect of HP on autonomic regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated changes in heart rate, arterial blood pressure (BP), and BRS within 4h after CA in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationship between BRS and neurodeficit score (NDS) was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although no significant differences were found in heart rate and BP before and after CA between the control and the preconditioned groups, both BRS and NDS of preconditioned rats were clearly higher than that of the control rats during recovery after CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, BRS in the first 4h after CA highly correlated with NDS 24h after CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results imply that treatment with HP improves autonomic regulation and protects the brain from ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The correlation between BRS and NDS also suggests that BRS can be a prognostic criterion for the level of brain injury after CA </plain></SENT>
