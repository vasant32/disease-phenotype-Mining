<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To analyze the relationship between snoring and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 79 consecutive patients of both sexes with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and 248 age and sex matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We obtained data reflecting arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, smoking and drinking habits, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopathy</z:e>, snoring, respiratory pauses during sleep and daytime sleepiness, by using a standard questionnaire to interview every subject and his/her spouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 53% of patients and 46% of controls snored often or always (p = 0.27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Snoring was significantly more frequent in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty four percent of patients and 27% of controls were snorers and suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> during sleep (p = 0.19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nineteen per cent of patients and 11% of controls presented snoring, respiratory pauses during sleep and daytime sleepiness simultaneously, suggesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e>) (p = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, by separately analyzing people younger than 65 years, the frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e> was significantly higher in patients (29%) than in controls (7%) (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, 10% of patients and 3% of controls presented snoring, respiratory pauses during sleep and moderate or severe daytime sleepiness simultaneously, suggesting moderate-severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e> (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A multiple logistic regression analysis confirmed the independent contribution of moderate-severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e> as a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, with an adjusted odds ratio of 4.54 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In people younger than 65 years, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e>, regardless of its severity, was also an independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, with an adjusted odds ratio of 5.78 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinically diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> syndrome is an independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, especially in people younger than 65 years </plain></SENT>
