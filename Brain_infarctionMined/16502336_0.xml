<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She was enrolled in an institutional study using a specially designed cooling helmet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bilateral intracranial pressure (ICP) and temperature probes were placed to determine if there was any differential cooling and ICP compartmentalization between the two hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated a significant temperature gradient between the infarcted and the non-infarcted hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant inter-hemispheric ICP gradient was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We believe that this is the first demonstration of preferential cooling of the infarcted hemisphere over the non-infarcted hemisphere with regional surface <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
