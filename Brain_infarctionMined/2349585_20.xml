<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The group comprised 11% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> inpatients with cerebrovascular pathology and 16% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive inpatients with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> studied at the Department of Neurology of the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main risk factors identified in these patients were arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in 164 (72%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in 64 (28%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> in 58 (26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common clinical syndromes were pure motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> in 125 (55%), pure hemisensory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 42 (18%), the sensorimotor deficit syndrome in 34 (15%), ataxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> in seven (3%), and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo>-clumsy hand syndrome in four (2%); atypical syndromes were observed in 15 patients (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lacunes were demonstrated by computed tomography in 100 patients (44%) and by magnetic resonance imaging in 35 (78%) of the 45 patients in which it was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging was significantly better (p less than 0.001) than computed tomography for imaging lacunes, especially those located in either the pons (p less than 0.005) or the internal capsule (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, mild or no neurologic disability was detected in 178 patients (78.4%), moderate disability persisted in 48 patients (21.1%), and severe disability was recorded in one case (0.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are a clearly defined entity with characteristic clinical features and an excellent short-term prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging is the current method of choice for demonstrating these <z:mp ids='MP_0000774'>small brain</z:mp> lesions </plain></SENT>
