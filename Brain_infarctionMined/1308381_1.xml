<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Main end-points of this study were 30-days case-fatality rates and the probability of early discharge or prolonged hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Proportions of patients exhibiting diverse evolutions were compared by Fisher's test and, when the number of observations permitted, by chi-square test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was diagnosed by history in 15.6% (17 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 86 cases analysed within 72 hours of admission, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level higher than 110 mg/dL) was detected in 67.4% (including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 14 diabetic patients (35.3% vs 21.7%; p = 0.18), but these patients probably were discharged early less frequently (23.5% vs 51.1%; p = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to the normoglycemic patients, hyperglycemic patients also fared worse, when considering altogether the early discharge and case fatality rates and the need for prolonged hospitalization (p = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They also exhibited a nonsignificant increase in early case fatality rate (31% vs 15.4%; p = 0.21) and a markedly reduced chance of obtaining early hospital discharge (37.9% vs 65.4%; p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Case fatality rates were maximal in diabetic hyperglycemic patients (42.9%) and seemed intermediate in non-diabetic hyperglycemic patients (27.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Considering the three end-points evaluated, the apparent differences between non-diabetic hyper and normoglycemic patients did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> "per se" have deleterious effects on the clinical evolution of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
