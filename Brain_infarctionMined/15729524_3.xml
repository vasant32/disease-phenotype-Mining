<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The origin of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disturbances</z:e> is yet unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) was used to elucidate the hypothesized relation between a lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, metabolic alterations, and neuropsychological function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with a single supratentorial lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (n = 26) were compared with patients with a mild myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (n = 12) and healthy controls (n = 12) on a comprehensive neuropsychological examination, and on the N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The volume of interest of the MRI/MRS examination was located in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing white matter of the centrum semiovale at a distance from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, in both the ipsilateral and contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On neuropsychological examination patients with a lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> performed worse than both patients with a myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> ratio was decreased in patients with a lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> compared with the other two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More important, this decrease in neurometabolites was significantly correlated to the level of cognitive functioning for the ipsilateral hemisphere and, although to a lesser extent, for the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that a single symptomatic lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the white matter is associated with (distant) disturbances in neurometabolites and that this decrease is related to a reduced cognitive capacity </plain></SENT>
