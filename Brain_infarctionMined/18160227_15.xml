<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether pre-ischemic exercise ameliorates blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) dysfunction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by reducing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 expression and strengthening basal lamina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a 30 min exercise program on a treadmill 5 days a week for 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> was induced by a 2-h middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion using an intraluminal filament in the exercised and non-exercised groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain infarction</z:e> was measured and neurological deficits were scored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> dysfunction was determined by examining <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and Evans Blue extravasation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of collagen IV, the major component of basal lamina essential for maintenance of the endothelial permeability barrier, was quantitatively detected by Western blot and immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ex vivo techniques were used to compare collagen IV-labeled vessels in response to ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Temporal relationship of expression of MMP-9 and its endogenous inhibitor, the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), was determined by real-time PCR for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and Western blot for protein during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>Brain edema</z:hpo> and Evans Blue leakage were both significantly (P&lt;0.01) reduced after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the exercised group, in association with reduced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis indicated that exercise enhanced collagen IV expression and reduced the collagen loss after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that collagen IV-labeled vessels were significantly (P&lt;0.01) increased in exercised rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the ex vivo study, after exercised brains were incubated with ischemic brain tissue, a significantly (P&lt;0.01) higher level of collagen IV-labeled vessels was observed as compared with non-exercised brains following the same treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The ex vivo study also revealed a key role of MMP-9 in exercise-strengthened collagen IV expression against I/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>TIMP-1 protein levels were significantly (P&lt;0.01) increased by exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that pre-ischemic exercise reduces brain injury by improving <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> function and enhancing basal lamina integrity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that the neuroprotective effect of physical exercise is associated with an imbalance of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 expression </plain></SENT>
