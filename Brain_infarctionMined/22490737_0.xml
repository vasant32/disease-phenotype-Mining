<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the influences of total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) on the feasibility and success rate of monitoring the evoked potentials (EP) and examine the correlations between EP changes and clinical outcomes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-one patients undergoing <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery received TIVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TIVA was maintained with a target controlled infusion (TCI) of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> and a continuous infusion of remifentanyl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The bilateral SEP (somatosensory evoked potential) and <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> (motor evoked potentials) were monitored intra-operatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>And the changes of evoked potential and success rate were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The preoperative and postoperative neurological outcomes and radiological manifestations were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bilateral SEP was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>And the control side <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> was unsuccessfully monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients had postoperative neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The amplitudes of <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> and SEP declined simultaneously and failed to revert back to the baseline levels in 1 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>And computed tomography showed multiple sites of ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The administration of TIVA with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> and remifentanyl enables successful SEP and <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> monitoring during <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This protocol may detect early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reduce the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
