<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our early life variable was idea density, which is a measure of linguistic ability, derived from autobiographies written at a mean age of 22 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six discrete categories of cognitive function, including mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo>, were evaluated, using the Consortium to Establish a Registry for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> (CERAD) battery of cognitive tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuropathologic data included Braak staging, neurofibrillary tangle and senile plaque counts, brain weight, degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo>, severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, and the presence of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early-life idea density was significantly related to the categories of late-life cognitive function, including mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo>: low idea density was associated with greater impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Low idea density also was significantly associated with lower brain weight, higher degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo>, more severe neurofibrillary pathology, and the likelihood of meeting neuropathologic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
