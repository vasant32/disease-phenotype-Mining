<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here an optimized and economic procedure of staining with TTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to reversible middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion (2-h <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 24-h reperfusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the end of reperfusion, brain was isolated and sliced rostro-caudally into serial 2-mm-thick slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sets of three serial slices from each brain were incubated for 30 min at 37 degrees C in three different concentrations of TTC-the first slice of the set in 1%, the second in 0.05% and the third in 0.1% TTC-in phosphate-buffered saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Staining characteristics, optical density (OD) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size were compared between juxtaposing cut surfaces of the slices stained with the three concentrations of TTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the first use, 0.05% TTC solution was stored at 4-8 degrees C and reused on the same day or on subsequent days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TTC at 0.05% concentration provided high contrast staining with clear demarcation between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in 0.05% TTC-stained slices correlated well with that in 0.1% TTC (r=0.92)- and 1% TTC (r=0.93)-stained preparations. 'Nonspecific' staining of corpus callosum and the anterior commissures was minimal with the method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Once-used 0.05% TTC solution could be stored at 4-8 degrees C and reused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, staining with 0.05% TTC provided improved delineation of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, reduced 'nonspecific' staining of white matter and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size correlated well with that measured after 1% TTC staining; the method also reduces the costs to 1/20 </plain></SENT>
