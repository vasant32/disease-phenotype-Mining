<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine whether <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> nerve fiber layer defect (RNFLD) is associated with cerebral small vessel diseases (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVDs</z:e>) and to identify risk factors for RNFLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 4421 Korean subjects who underwent health checkups including brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fundus photography between January 2008 and October 2009 were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Co-morbid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic diseases</z:e> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or ocular diseases were evaluated using detailed questionnaires and medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two experienced ophthalmologists assessed RNFLD on fundus photographs, according to the definition that describes the condition as marked thinning or absence of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> nerve fiber layer bundles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RNFLD was detected in 238 of 4395 eligible subjects, and the estimated prevalence was 5.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression analysis results showed the prevalence of RNFLD to be significantly higher in hypertensive subjects (odds ratio [OR], 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-2.34), in those with cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> based on MRI (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.17-2.12), and in male (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.10-1.96) and older subjects (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00-1.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the cases of cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>, white matter lesions (WMLs) were associated with RNFLD, whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> were not significantly associated with it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that RNFLD may be related to the presence of cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>, particularly WMLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, being older and male and having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> increase the risk of RNFLD </plain></SENT>
