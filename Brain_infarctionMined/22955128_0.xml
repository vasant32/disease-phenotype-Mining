<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential relationship between <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and poststroke mood, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e>, disability, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> site and to determine the predictive factors in the development of poststroke <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (PSF) following minor <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-nine functionally active patients aged less than 70 years with a first, nondisabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score ≤6 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase and ≤3 after 6 months, modified Rankin Scale score ≤1 at 6 months) were assessed during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase and then at 6 (T1) and 12 months (T2) after their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Scores in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>Fatigue</z:mp> Assessment Inventory were described and correlated to age, gender, neurologic and functional impairment, lesion site, mood scores, neuropsychological data, laboratory data, and quality of life at T1 and T2 using a multivariate logistic regression analysis in order to determine which variables recorded at T1 best predicted <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> at T2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULT: As many as 30.5% of the patients at T1 and 34.7% at T2 (11.6% new cases between T1 and T2) reported <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At both 6 and 12 months, there was a significant association between <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> and a reduction in professional activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Attentional-executive impairment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> levels remained associated with PSF throughout this time period, underlining the critical role of these variables in the genesis of PSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant association between the lesion site and PSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study suggests that attentional and executive impairment, as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, may play a critical role in the development of PSF </plain></SENT>
