<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The expression of the monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) 1, 2, and 4 have been studied in the brains of spontaneous hypertensive (SH) rats after an ischemic insult induced by a permanent occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Profound temporal changes in MCT1 expression were observed in various regions of the ipsilateral hemisphere over the period of 1 hr to 5 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initially, a very rapid and transient increase in MCT1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was observed in neurons in the second layer of the cortex and in the piriform cortex at 1-3 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A slower but sustained increase in MCT1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was observed in astrocytes in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region beginning at 6 hr after MCAO and persisting over a period of 120 hr coinciding with their activation, migration, and involvement in scar formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An increase in MCT1 expression in endothelial cells was seen over the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These increases in MCT1 expression in astrocytes and endothelial cells were accompanied by a corresponding increase in MCT1 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally at 120 hr post-MCAO, increases in MCT1, MCT2, and MCT4 expression were observed in cells within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and bordering the scar, the identity of which remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consistent with cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, the levels of MCT1, MCT2, and MCT4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> decreased with cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within the infarcted area but unlike MCT1, no increases in either MCT2 or 4 were observed within the remaining ipsilateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These studies reveal that the pattern of regulation of MCT1 expression after MCAO is similar to that observed previously for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter 1 (GLUT1) and suggest that the regulation of MCT1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression is mediated by the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible transcription factor HIF1 </plain></SENT>
