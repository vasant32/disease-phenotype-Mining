<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the interplay of functional recovery and compensation in postischemic motor behavior is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study focused on the time course of functional recovery versus motor compensation in skilled forelimb movements after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Young adult male rats underwent a focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by unilateral photothrombotic lesion of the motor cortex related to the preferred forelimb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a first set of experiments animals were exposed to small cortical lesions comprising the forelimb motor cortex (n=8) or to larger lesions additionally extending into the hind limb motor area (n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a second set of experiments animals with large lesion were either housed in standard (n=10) or enriched environment (n=14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Skilled reaching was assessed for 25 to 28 days postischemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This task allows the distinction between recovery and compensation by parallel quantitative (reaching success) and qualitative (movement pattern) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results reveal that lesion size determines the initial magnitude of motor deficits, but not the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> impairments in movement pattern in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> experimental groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compensatory movements represent the major mechanism of functional improvement and were accompanied by a partial functional restitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Enriched environment facilitates effective compensation in skilled reaching, while it does not promote restitution of function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In particular, rotating movements of the forelimb during reaching were permanently impaired and required functional compensation through intensified use of the upper body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude an activity dependent postischemic restoration of movement success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Enriched environment provides benefit by increased motor activity mainly due to compensation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these findings emphasize the power of comprehensive movement analysis to gain insight into recovery processes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
