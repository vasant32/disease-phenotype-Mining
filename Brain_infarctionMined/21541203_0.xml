<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The management of incidental unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> remains a matter of controversy; middle-sized or large anterior circulation incidental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, in young or middle age patients, should be considered for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgical clipping is an accepted treatment for middle cerebral artery unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ischemic events can occur even in cases of incidental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since regional cerebral blood flow can be compromised due to temporary arterial clipping or to incorrect placement of defi nitive clip, we performed intra-operative monitoring of brain tissue oxygen concentration (PtiO(2)), to detect changes in brain oxygenation due to reduced blood fl ow, eventually leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, during surgery of middle cerebral artery incidental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PtiO(2) monitoring was performed during surgery of eight patients harboring incidental <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, using a polarographic microcatheter (Licox, GMS - Kiel, Germany), placed in the temporal lobe on the side of the lesion, from dural opening to dural closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Basal values varied between 2.3 and 27.3 mmHg; these values are lower than those previously described in the literature as "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" for uninjured brain or in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, a significant decrease in PtiO2 was found in every period of temporary clipping of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Post-operative infarction in the territory of middle cerebral artery occurred in one patient and, in that case, there was a persistent minimum value of 0.6 mmHg, without recovery after the placement of the definitive clip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In another patient, an incorrect placement of the definitive clip could be predicted by a decrease in PtiO(2) value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PtiO(2) monitoring during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery shows brain tissue perfusion in real time and there is a correlation between any episode of reduced blood flow to the affected vascular territory during surgery and a decrease of PtiO2 values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Unexpected low basal values were obtained in "uninjured" brain, with no influence from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The values of risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> during temporary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> still need further studies, but an incomplete recovery or a persistent fall in PtiO(2) values after definitive clipping should be considered as an indication for verification of the position of the clip </plain></SENT>
