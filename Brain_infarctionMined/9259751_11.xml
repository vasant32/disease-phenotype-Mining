<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Strands are thin and filamentous attachments on the cardiac valves shown by transesophageal echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their nature and their potential for embolization are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective was to estimate the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in patients with mitral valve strands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using transesophageal echocardiography, we compared the frequency of strands on native mitral valves in 284 consecutive patients admitted with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and 276 control patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> older than 60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a second part, case subjects were followed up over a 2- to 4-year period, and the risk of recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was estimated in patients with and without strands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the case-control study, mitral valve strands were found in 22.5% of the case patients and in 12.1% of the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In case subjects, mitral valve strands were more frequent in those with mitral valve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> (52.4% versus 37.4%; P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Strands were not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, annular calcifications, or left atrial spontaneous echocardiographic contrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, sex, and mitral valve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath>, the odds ratio for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> among patients with mitral strands was 2.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 3.6; P = .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of strands was not different in patients with a known cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (24.4%) from that in patients with no other apparent cause (20.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During 646 per 100 person-years of follow-up, the incidence of recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was 6.0 person-years in patients with strands and 4.2 in those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the Cox analysis, including potential confounders and poststroke treatment, mitral valve strands did not appear as independent predictors of recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (relative risk, 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 3.0; P = .54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows an independent association between mitral valve strands and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the lack of an increased relative risk of recurrence raises doubts about the potential causal relation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in patients aged 60 years or older </plain></SENT>
