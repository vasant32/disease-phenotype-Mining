<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain cooling was accomplished by infusion of 5 mL of 4°C saline over 5 minutes via the external jugular vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immediately after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of traumatic brain injury, rats were randomized into two groups and given 37°C or 4°C <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another group of rats were used as sham operated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Behavioral and biochemical assessments were conducted on 72 hours after brain injury or sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As compared to those of the sham-operated controls, the 37°C saline-treated brain injured animals displayed motor deficits, higher cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp> volume and incidence, higher oxidative damage (e.g., lower values of cerebral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase, catalase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> reductase, but higher values of cerebral malondialdehyde), and higher nitrostative damage (e.g., higher values of neuronal nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase and 3-nitrotyrosine) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the motor deficits and brain nitrostative and oxidative damage were significantly reduced by retrograde perfusion of 4°C saline via the jugular vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that brain cooling may improve the outcomes of traumatic brain injury in rats by reducing brain nitrostative and oxidative damage </plain></SENT>
