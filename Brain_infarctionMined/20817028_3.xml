<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven-day-old rat pups were subjected to 2h of 8% oxygen following unilateral carotid artery ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain tissue was obtained for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52097">JC-1</z:chebi> staining at 24h after <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (HI), and the results were compared with those of other simultaneous measurements such as flow cytometry with fluoresceinated annexin V/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> (PI), terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining, triphenyl tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and western blot for cytosolic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow cytograms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52097">JC-1</z:chebi> showed two distinct sub-populations with different ΔΨ, red with high ΔΨ and green with low ΔΨ, at 24h after HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This shift of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52097">JC-1</z:chebi> fluorescence from red to green indicated a collapse of ΔΨ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increased percentage of low ΔΨ with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52097">JC-1</z:chebi> showed a significant positive correlation with a simultaneous increase in annexin V(+)/PI(+) necrotic cells, TUNEL-positive cells, TTC <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and western blot of cytosolic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>, and negative correlation with annexin V(-)/PI(-) live cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In summary, low ΔΨ measured with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52097">JC-1</z:chebi> was significantly correlated with results from other methods used to assess the extent of brain damage after HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, fluorocytometric analysis of ΔΨ with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52097">JC-1</z:chebi> might be a sensitive and reliable technique in the quantitative evaluation of neonatal brain injury </plain></SENT>
