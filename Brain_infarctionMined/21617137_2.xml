<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether collateral rarefaction and impaired remodeling contribute to this is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We quantified the number and diameter of native collaterals and their remodeling in 3-, 16-, 24-, and 31-month-old mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Aging caused an "age-dose-dependent" greater drop in perfusion immediately after femoral artery ligation, followed by a diminished recovery of flow and increase in tissue injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These effects were associated with a decline in collateral number, diameter, and remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>Angiogenesis</z:mpath> was also impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mechanistically, these changes were not accompanied by reduced recruitment of T cells or macrophages to remodeling collaterals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase signaling was dysfunctional, as indicated by increased protein nitrosylation and less phosphorylated endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi>-stimulated phosphoprotein in collateral wall cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cerebral circulation exhibited a similar age-dose-dependent loss of collateral number and diameter and increased tortuosity, resulting in an increase in collateral resistance and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (eg, 6- and 3-fold, respectively, in 24-month-old mice) after <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was not associated with rarefaction of similarly sized arterioles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Collateral remodeling was also reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that aging causes rarefaction and insufficiency of the collateral circulation in multiple tissues, resulting in more severe ischemic tissue injury </plain></SENT>
