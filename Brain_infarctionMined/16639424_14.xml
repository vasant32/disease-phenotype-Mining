<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While increased expression of VEGF has been demonstrated in animal models after experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, these studies have focused almost exclusively on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the association of VEGF to neurons in remote cortical areas at three days after an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in primary motor cortex (M1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although these remote areas are outside of the direct influence of the ischemic injury, remote plasticity has been implicated in recovery of function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For this study, intracortical microstimulation techniques identified primary and premotor cortical areas in a non-human primate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A focal ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was induced in the M1 hand representation, and neurons and VEGF protein were identified using immunohistochemical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stereological techniques quantitatively assessed neuronal-VEGF association in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> regions, M1 hindlimb, M1 orofacial, and ventral premotor hand representations, as well as non-motor control regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that VEGF protein significantly increased association to neurons in specific remote cortical areas outside of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increased association of VEGF to neurons was restricted to cortical areas that are functionally and/or behaviorally related to the area of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant increase in M1 orofacial region or in non-motor control regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that enhancement of neuronal VEGF in these functionally related remote cortical areas may be involved in recovery of function after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, through either neuroprotection or the induction of remote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
