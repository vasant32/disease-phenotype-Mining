<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The genetic involvement of the renin-angiotensin system in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> also remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To predict the genetic risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e>, we conducted an association study in an Ohasama population, which is the cohort in a rural region of northern Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 134 subjects without major neurological, cardiovascular, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using brain magnetic resonance imaging, the number of lacunae in each of four brain regions were calculated, and periventricular hyperintensity was classified into five grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used the following four candidate gene polymorphisms: angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)/Insertion(I)-Deletion(D), angiotensinogen (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e>)/M235T, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> type 1 receptor (AT1)/ A1166C, type 2 receptor (AT2)/C3123A, to examine the association between polymorphisms and the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e>/M235T was significantly associated with the number of lacunae in the brain stem, the basal ganglia (P &lt; .05), and whole brain (P &lt; .005) regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The AT1 polymorphism was also significantly associated with the number of lacunae in the basal ganglia and whole brain regions (P &lt; .05), and with periventricular hyperintensity grade (P &lt; .005) in the younger population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, ACE and AT2 polymorphisms failed to show an association with either the number of lacunae or the PVH grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We concluded that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e> and AT1 polymorphisms are independent genetic risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
