<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a previous study, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> cases from the general population were found to be at significantly increased risk of silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-like lesions in the posterior circulation (PC) territory of the brain, notably in the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we describe the clinical and neuroimaging characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> cases with and without aura and controls with PC lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, 39 PC <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-like lesions represented the majority (65%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 60 identified brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-like lesions in the study sample (n = 435 subjects with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most lesions (n = 33) were located in the cerebellum, often multiple, and were round or oval-shaped, with a mean size of 7 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority (88%) of infratentorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-like lesions had a vascular border zone location in the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of these border zone lesions differed between controls (0.7%), cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002083'>migraine without aura</z:hpo> (2.2%) and cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>migraine with aura</z:hpo> (7.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Besides higher age, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> were not more prevalent in cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> with PC lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Presence of these lesions was not associated with supratentorial brain changes, such as white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combination of vascular distribution, deep border zone location, shape, size and imaging characteristics on MRI makes it likely that the lesions have an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Previous investigators attributed cases of similar 'very small' cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> patients to a number of different <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The relevance and likelihood of the aetiological options are placed in the context of known <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, the specific involvement of the cerebellum in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that a combination of (possibly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> attack-related) hypoperfusion and embolism is the likeliest mechanism for PC infarction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, and not <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> or small-vessel disease </plain></SENT>
