<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Consistent with previous reports, we observed a significant association of the APOE epsilon 4 allele with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> (AD) in a series of 91 autopsy-confirmed cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The epsilon 4 allele frequency was higher in cases with a family history of AD-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (0.54 +/- 0.07), although the epsilon 4 allele frequency in the AD cases with a negative family history (0.38 +/- 0.05) remained significantly greater than that for the non-AD control group (0.13 +/- 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A similar increase in epsilon 4 allele frequency (0.54 +/- 0.07) was observed in the AD cases with amyloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e>, compared to those who did not have amyloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> (0.36 +/- 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Contrary to previous reports, no effect of the dosage of the epsilon 4 allele was found on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> among the AD cases and, contrary to reports suggesting an association of epsilon 4 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, the epsilon 4 allele frequency was similar in cases with or without concurrent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Modest but consistent correlations were observed between the dosage of epsilon 4 alleles and the cortical density of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>senile plaques</z:hpo>, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The last finding suggests that the pathogenic events mediated by the epsilon 4 allele may be more directly involved in the formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>senile plaques</z:hpo>, the identifying lesions in AD, than <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A robust association of both the presence of an epsilon 4 allele and a family history of AD-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with concurrent amyloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> occurred within our sample of AD cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This association arose from an interaction of the epsilon 4 allele with a separate familial factor for which a family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> served as a surrogate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that amyloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> may be a common or central feature of a form of familial AD that is associated with the transmission of the APOE epsilon 4 allele </plain></SENT>
