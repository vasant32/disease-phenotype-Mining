<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Appropriate antibodies and a sensitive ELISA were generated, and the release of UCHL1 into CSF was compared with that of pNF-H and S100beta in a cohort of 30 ASAH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both UCHL1 and pNF-H showed persistent release into CSF in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in the second week postaneurysmal rupture (AR), and S100beta levels rapidly declined to baseline levels in 23 of 30 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven of thirty patients showed persistently elevated S100beta levels over the first 5 days post-AR and also had relatively higher levels of pNF-H and UCHL1 higher compared with the rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients proved to have very poor outcomes, with 6 of 7 expiring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who did reduce S100beta levels tended to have a better outcome if pNF-H and UCHL1 levels were also lower, and elevated UCHL1 levels in the second week post-AR were particularly predictive of poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> coordinated releases of large amounts of UCHL1, pNF-H, and S100beta in 16 of 30 patients were observed, suggesting sudden loss of brain tissues associated with secondary events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that measurement of the CSF levels of these proteins reveals details of ASAH progression and recovery and predicts patient outcome </plain></SENT>
