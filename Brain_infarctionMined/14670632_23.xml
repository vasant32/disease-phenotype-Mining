<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> on brain injury and apoptotic neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as well as related biochemical changes after neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (HI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven-day-old rats were subjected to left common carotid artery ligation and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (7.8%) for 1 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> was induced immediately after <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and body temperature was maintained at 30 degrees C for 10 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The normothermic group was kept at 36 degrees C </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">Cytochrome c</z:chebi> release and activation of caspase-3 and -2 at 24 h post-HI were significantly diminished by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The numbers of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>- and TUNEL-positive cells in the cortex and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus were significantly reduced in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> group compared with the normothermia group at 72 h post-HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> may, at least partially, act through inhibition of the intrinsic pathway of caspase activation in the neonatal brain, thereby preventing apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
