<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (LS) can be subtyped according to the absence (isolated lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> [ILA]) or presence of concomitant white matter lesions (WML) and/or asymptomatic lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endothelial activation is thought to play a pivotal role in the subtype with WML and/or asymptomatic lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate whether endothelial activation is associated with WML and/or asymptomatic lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in LS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we determined levels of circulating blood markers of endothelial function in LS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 149 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had brain-MRI, levels of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), tPA-PAI-1 complex, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor, tissue factor, thrombomodulin, and coagulation factor VIII were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Levels of blood markers were related to subtypes of LS and adjusted for age, gender, and vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In subtypes of LS, tPA activity was increased in patients with WML (0.79 IU/mL vs 0.44 IU/mL for ILA; P=0.02) and PAI-1-antigen levels were lowest in patients with WML (27.5 ng/mL vs 44.0 ng/mL for ILA; P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association between WML and PAI-1 remained significant after multivariable analysis (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.98-1.00 per ng/mL change of PAI-1; P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found further evidence for the hypothesis of endothelial activation in the subtype of LS caused by a diffuse small vessel vasculopathy, as we found higher levels of tPA in patients with concomitant extensive WML than in those with ILA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Second, low levels of PAI-1 were associated with WML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We postulate that differences in activity of components of the fibrinolytic system might contribute to WML development </plain></SENT>
