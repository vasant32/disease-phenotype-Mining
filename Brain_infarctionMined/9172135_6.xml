<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined Stat1 in the rat brain during development and following transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, using Western immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two bands of 91 and 84 kDa, corresponding to Stat1 alpha and Stat1 beta forms, were found with an intensity that increased from postnatal day 0 to adulthood in cerebellum and cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> caused a strong induction of Stat1 in the ipsilateral cortex after 4, 7 and 15 days, but not at 6 or 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results show that Stat1 is normally expressed in the postnatal and adult rat brain and is induced under <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
