<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Selections from fixed paraffin-embedded specimens were stained for histological examination with H &amp; E and Verhoeff-van Gieson stain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> dye Oil Red O was used to stain vessel specimens that were embolized using NBCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specimens were evaluated for the presence of embolic agent, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, angionecrosis, and evidence of recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results were correlated with the time interval between the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, embolization, and resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The smallest vessel occluded by the embolic agent was 5 microm in the Onyx group and 20 microm in the NBCA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was evidence of vascular or perivascular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in 20 (90.9%) of 22 and 9 (90%) of 10 specimens after Onyx and NBCA embolization, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> foreign-body giant cells were observed in 12 (54.5%) of 22 specimens after Onyx embolization, but were absent in specimens after NBCA embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Angionecrosis of the embolized vessel was observed in 13 (59.1%) of 22 specimens and in 4 (40%) of 10 specimens after Onyx and NBCA embolization, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was evidence of recanalization in Onyx embolized vessels in 4 (18.2%) of 22 specimens, and there was no evidence of recanalization after NBCA embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Onyx penetrates much smaller vessels than NBCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp> occurs with both embolic agents at equal frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> foreign-body giant cells and recanalization after Onyx embolization shows a long-standing reaction to Onyx and raises questions about the permanence of occlusion after Onyx embolization </plain></SENT>
