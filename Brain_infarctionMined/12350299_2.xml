<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brainstem material from these 38 infants was studied in an attempt to elucidate the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> and neuronal pathological changes in the arousal pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analyses included the evaluation of growth-associated phosphoprotein 43 (GAP43) as a marker for synaptic plasticity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) method was used to identify <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The positive pathological reactions were quantitatively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pathological and physiological data were linked for each infant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Akaike Information Criterion (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIC</z:e>) statistics was calculated to elucidate the relationship between the physiological and the pathological data in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e> victims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The findings illustrated the possibility of an organic fragility within the arousal pathway, particularly in the midbrain periaqueductal gray matter, which is associated with the "visceral alerting response" </plain></SENT>
