<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A high incidence of thrombotic events in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271979" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia intermedia</z:e> (TI) patients led to the identification of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain involvement has not been widely studied in TI, although limited reports confirm a low incidence of overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and high incidence of silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS/METHODS: This was a prospective study conducted on 30 adult, splenectomized TI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were screened for absence of neurological signs or symptoms, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient charts were reviewed for demographics, duration since splenectomy, and any history of transfusion therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were obtained for complete blood counts and serum ferritin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Direct determination of liver iron concentration (LIC) was performed by R2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, looking for ischemic lesions and/or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 32.1 +/- 11 years (range, 18-54 years), with a male to female ratio of 13:17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients (60%) had evidence of one or more white matter lesions (WMLs) on brain MRI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> involving the subcortical white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had evidence of multiple WMLs, with a mean of 5 +/- 10 lesions (range, 2 to &gt; 40 lesions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of patients (94%) had small (&lt; 0.5 cm) to medium (0.5-1.5 cm) WMLs, with only one patient showing evidence of a large (&gt; 1.5 cm) WML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (37%) had mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis only age and transfusion history were independently and significantly associated with the occurrence of zero, single or multiple WMLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: WMLs and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> are a common finding in adult, splenectomized, TI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Increasing age and transfusion naivety are associated with a higher incidence and multiplicity of lesions </plain></SENT>
