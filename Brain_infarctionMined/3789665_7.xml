<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MRI showed focal parenchymal changes in 84% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>, whereas CT showed similar changes in 42% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of MRI was also greater in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, but the difference between CT and MRI was not as great </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> were usually better delineated by MRI regardless of location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, MRI failed to reveal cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> that were clearly seen on contrast-enhanced CT scans and was unable to clearly distinguish <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hemorrhagic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI changes were best detected with T2-weighted images and usually appeared as multiple areas of increased signal intensity in the subcortical and periventricular white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRI changes often could not be correlated with the clinical history and neurological findings; identical changes have been seen in patients with no history of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
