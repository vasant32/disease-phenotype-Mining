<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a prospective, observational study carried out in the Neurocritical Care Unit of a level 1 trauma center in a teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 41,809 paired records for neuromonitoring variables were analyzed and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A direct and independent correlation between rSO(2) and PbrO(2) was confirmed through adjusted [beta coefficient and (95% confidence interval, CI) = 0.36 (0.35-0.37)] and logistic [PbrO(2) &gt;or=15 mmHg, as a dependent variable; adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and (95% CI) = 1.11 (1.10-1.12)] regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve demonstrated that rSO(2) had low accuracy for detecting moderate (PbrO(2) &lt;or=15 mmHg) intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> [area under curve (AUC) = 0.62], with the likelihood ratio for a positive test (LR+) = 1.2 for an optimal cutoff of rSO(2) &lt;or=70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the ROC analysis showed that rSO(2) was moderately accurate for detecting severe (PbrO(2) &lt;or=12 mmHg) intracerebral hypoxemia (AUC = 0.82; LR+ = 5.3) for an optimal cutoff of rSO(2) &lt;or=60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe TBI, PbrO(2) and rSO(2) were directly and significantly related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Severe intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> was better detected by rSO(2) than was moderate intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the diagnostic accuracy of rSO(2) was limited, and this measure should not be considered a substitute for routine PbrO(2) monitoring </plain></SENT>
