<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although early removal of blood can reduce mortality, patients still die or remain disabled after surgery and additional treatments are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The blood mass and extravasated blood induce pathomechanisms such as high intracranial pressure (ICP), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> which lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> as well as delayed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only little is known about the basis of delayed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in this type of injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the purpose of the study was to investigate to which extent caspase-dependent intracellular processes are involved in the lesion development after ASDH in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A volume of 300microL blood was infused into the subdural space under monitoring of ICP and tissue oxygen concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To asses delayed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> mechanisms, DNA fragmentation was measured 1, 2, 4 and 7 days after ASDH by TUNEL staining, and the effect of the pan-caspase inhibitor zVADfmk on lesion volume was assessed 7 days post-ASDH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A peak of TUNEL-positive cells was found in the injured cortex at day 2 after blood infusion (53.4+/-11.6 cells/mm(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>zVADfmk (160ng), applied by intracerebroventricular injection before ASDH, reduced lesion volume significantly by more than 50% (vehicle: 23.79+/-7.62mm(3); zVADfmk: 9.06+/-4.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data show for the first time that apoptotic processes are evident following ASDH and that caspase-dependent mechanisms play a crucial role in the lesion development caused by the blood effect on brain tissue </plain></SENT>
