<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these, 26 died from sudden infant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e>), 5 from congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo>, 2 from infected pulmonary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 2 from septic shock with multi-organ failure, 1 from a prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, 1 from prolonged neonatal hypoxemia, and 1 from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency and duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apneas</z:hpo> recorded some 3-12 weeks prior to the infants' <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The brainstem materials were collected and studied in an attempt to elucidate the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo>, and prone sleep position and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> in some nuclei associated with cardiorespiratory characteristics, such as nucleus ambiguus in the medulla oblongata and the solitary nucleus, as well as structures associated with arousal phenomenon, such as the reticular formation, the superior central nucleus and the nucleus raphe magnus in the pons, the dorsal raphe nuclei in the midbrain and medulla oblongata, periaqueductal gray matter in midbrain, and locus ceruleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>Gliosis</z:hpo> was estimated as the density of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive reactive astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Variant-covariant analyses were carried out using the characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> as an independent variable and sleep position and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> as dependent variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant association was found only in the frequency of obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> and prone position (P&lt;0.001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> in the raphe nuclei in the midbrain (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although prone position is a well-known risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e>, the frequency of obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> has not been associated with the prone sleep position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The observed relation between prone sleep and the density of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> does not relate to epidemiological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to investigate the unexpected statistical association </plain></SENT>
