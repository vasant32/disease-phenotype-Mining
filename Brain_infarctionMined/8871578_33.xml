<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In circulation, C is constantly inhibited to prevent attack on host cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since a host of diseases produce an abnormal blood-brain/cerebrospinal fluid (blood-brain/CSF) permeability allowing C protein extravasation, we investigated if C activation occurs in CSF in vitro and in <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> in vivo during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After SAH (n = 15), the terminal complement complex (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="48347">TCC</z:chebi>) concentration on days 0 to 2 was higher in the CSF, 210 +/- 61 ng/ml, than in the plasma, 63 +/- 17 ng/ml, but null in the CSF of controls (n = 8) or patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="48347">TCC</z:chebi> was eliminated from the CSF after SAH (24 +/- 10 ng/ml on days 7 to 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incubation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human CSF with serum in vitro also activated the terminal C pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 10 fatal ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e>, immunohistochemical techniques demonstrated neuronal fragment-associated deposition of C9 accompanied by neutrophil infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the C system becomes activated intrathecally in SAH and focally in the brain parenchyma in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By promoting chemotaxis and vascular perturbation, C activation may instigate nonimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and aggravate <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> damage in diseases associated with plasma extravasation </plain></SENT>
