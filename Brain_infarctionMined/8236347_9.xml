<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The effects of delayed thrombolysis with alteplase and neuroprotection with an excitatory amino acid receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> and their combination were tested in an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 61 rats the carotid artery territory was embolized with arterial-like fibrin-rich clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hemispheric cerebral blood flow before and after embolization was measured by intra-arterial 133Xe injection method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were assigned to one of the following treatments: (1) vehicle-treated controls (n = 15); (2) dizocilpine 1 mg/kg i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>5 minutes after embolization (n = 16); (3) alteplase 20 mg/kg as an intravenous continuous infusion starting 2 hours after embolization (n = 16); and (4) both agents (n = 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carotid angiography displayed the site of occlusion of the cerebral arterial tree immediately after and 3 hours after embolization, and the clinical neurological score was assessed after the rats recovered from anesthesia and before the rats were killed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brains were fixed after 2 days and evaluated neuropathologically; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume affecting cortical and deep brain structures was measured separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both alteplase and dizocilpine reduced the total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (P = .05 and P = .04, respectively, Mann-Whitney tests) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dizocilpine reduced the incidence of cortical infarctions by 48% (P &lt; .001, Fisher's test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only the combined treatment significantly reduced deep <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> (P = .03, Mann-Whitney test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The combined treatment also improved the clinical score by 83% compared with controls, by 75% compared with the group treated by dizocilpine alone, and by 50% compared with the group treated by alteplase alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sixty-seven percent of thrombolytic-treated animals recanalized completely compared with 39% of those given no thrombolytics (P = .05, Fisher's test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcome correlated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (P &lt; .01, Spearman test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results document comparable efficacy of delayed thrombolysis and excitatory amino acid receptor antagonism in this model and suggest that combination of these two therapeutic approaches may yield additional benefit in treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo>, particularly in cases where deep brain (end-artery-supplied) structures are affected </plain></SENT>
