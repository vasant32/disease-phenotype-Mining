<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The method uses a microcomputer interfaced to a digitising pad and linear plotter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Areas of brain damage are drawn on standardised maps, digitised, manipulated in computer memory, and summated using computer graphics facilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The composites show the position of brain damage in groups of patients as a contour map of the extent of lesion overlap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The method can be used to study neurological and neuropsychological deficits using CT-scan, or other imaging techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Deep and superficial lesions may be displayed equally well </plain></SENT>
