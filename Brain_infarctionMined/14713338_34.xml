<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify the possibility of clinical application, we examined the effects of intravenously administered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52292">TRX</z:chebi> in a model of transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mature male C57BL/6j mice received either continuous intravenous infusion of recombinant human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52292">TRX</z:chebi> (rhTRX) over a range of 1-10 mg/kg, bovine serum albumin, or vehicle alone for 2 h after 90-min transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after the transient MCAO, the animals were evaluated neurologically and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume, neurological deficit, and protein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi> contents, a marker of protein oxidation, in the brain were significantly ameliorated in rhTRX-treated mice at the dose of 3 and 10 mg/kg versus these parameters in control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, activation of p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase, whose pathway is involved in ischemic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, was suppressed in the rhTRX-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, rhTRX was detected in the ischemic hemisphere by western blot analysis, suggesting that rhTRX was able to permeate the blood-brain barrier in the ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that exogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52292">TRX</z:chebi> exerts distinct cytoprotective effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury in mice by means of its redox-regulating activity </plain></SENT>
