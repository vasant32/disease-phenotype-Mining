<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Leptin is the major adipose hormone that regulates body weight and energy expenditure by activating leptin receptors in the hypothalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Leptin receptors are also present in other cell types, and a potent antiapoptotic effect for leptin has recently been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether leptin was neuroprotective against ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In vitro ischemic injury was induced in rat primary neuronal culture by oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation for 90 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vivo ischemic brain injury was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in mice for 60 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Leptin receptors were detected in cultured rat cortical neurons, as well as in the mouse cortex, striatum, and hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro results showed that leptin, 50 to 100 mug/mL, protected primary cortical neurons against <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced by oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation in a concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vivo studies in the mouse brain demonstrated that the intraperitoneal administration of leptin, 2 to 8 mg/kg, dose-dependently reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Leptin was effective when injected 5 minutes before or 30 to 90 minutes after reperfusion, but not 2 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Leptin improved animal body weight recovery and behavioral parameters after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Leptin enhanced the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 activation and neuroprotection were abolished by the administration of PD98059 in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Leptin is neuroprotective against ischemic neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that leptin is a legitimate candidate for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
