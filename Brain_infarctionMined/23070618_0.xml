<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We provide an update on the neuroanatomical substrates of VCI and emphasize the following structures or areas: (1) new concepts in relation to hippocampal involvement in VCI based on neuropathological and MRI studies of microinfarcts and the role of traditional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in possibly mediating or potentiating <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>; (2) advances in our understanding of cerebral microbleeds; and (3) an update on white matter hyperintensities and small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
