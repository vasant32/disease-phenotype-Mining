<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A multicenter <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registration study based on a computerized database from 54 Japanese institutes, involving 8,036 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> who were hospitalized within 48 h after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> between January 2000 and March 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Within 30 days after the initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 395 patients (4.9%) developed a recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recurrence most frequently occurred in atherothrombotic patients (6.6%), followed by cardioembolic patients (6.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR 1.348, 95% CI 1.071-1.696) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (OR 1.503, 95% CI 1.177-1.918), but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, were independently predictive of early recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In atherothrombotic patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (OR 1.485, 95% CI 1.058-2.085) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (OR 1.998, 95% CI 1.231-3.244) were independently related to early recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At hospital discharge, the modified Rankin Scale score was higher in patients who had an early recurrence (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study was based on a large number of Japanese patients and confirmed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> contribute to early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, analysis by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was independently related to early recurrence in atherothrombotic patients </plain></SENT>
