<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, we find prolonged stimulation that differs with the size of cortical lesion to be effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two weeks of prolonged epidural electrical stimulation and rehabilitative training were delivered to rats whose cortex had been subjected to photothrombotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> after training in a single-pellet reaching task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Continuous stimulation greatly improved recovery in animals with large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (6 mm diameter), while intermittent stimulation was more effective in animals with small (4 mm) lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, prolonged cortical stimulation is a strategy to enhance motor recovery in photothrombotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> model rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, pattern and duration of stimulation requires modification depending on the extent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
