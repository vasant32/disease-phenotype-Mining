<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are frequently seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in healthy elderly people and may be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the association between silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in 1015 participants of the prospective, population-based Rotterdam Scan Study, who were 60 to 90 years of age and free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at base line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants underwent neuropsychological testing and cerebral MRI at base line in 1995 to 1996 and again in 1999 to 2000 and were monitored for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> throughout the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed Cox proportional-hazards and multiple linear-regression analyses, adjusted for age, sex, and level of education and for the presence or absence of subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and white-matter lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 3697 person-years of follow-up (mean per person, 3.6 years), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> developed in 30 of the 1015 participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> at base line more than doubled the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (hazard ratio, 2.26; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.09 to 4.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on the base-line MRI was associated with worse performance on neuropsychological tests and a steeper decline in global cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Silent thalamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were associated with a decline in memory performance, and nonthalamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> with a decline in psychomotor speed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When participants with silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> at base line were subdivided into those with and those without additional <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> at follow-up, the decline in cognitive function was restricted to those with additional silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elderly people with silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> have an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and a steeper decline in cognitive function than those without such lesions </plain></SENT>
