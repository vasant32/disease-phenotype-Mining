<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, control of both the contralesional (paretic) and ipsilesional (less affected) arms is altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to analyse the consequences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on joint rotations of both shoulder girdles, that is, glenohumeral (GH) and scapula motion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of hemispheric specialization, we hypothesized that changes would relate to the side of hemisphere damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with left, and 9 with right hemisphere damage (LHD and RHD) and 9 healthy subjects were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reaching movements to targets positioned close, far and high in three directions were recorded using an electromagnetic system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Initial and final postures of the scapula, GH and elbow joint were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inter-joint rotations throughout the movements were analysed using principal component analysis (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main finding was that initial and final postures of the contralesional and ipsilesional shoulders differed depending on the side of brain lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the contralesional side, there was less scapula protraction and GH lateral rotation for both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Scapula tilt was less anterior in LHD patients, and GH elevation was greater in RHD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the ipsilesional side, GH lateral rotation was reduced in both groups, and scapula protraction was reduced only for LHD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> confirmed that postures of both shoulders of the LHD group were substantially different to the healthy subjects, while only the contralesional arm of the RHD subjects differed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results add to existing knowledge of hemispheric specialization, suggesting that the left hemisphere plays a greater role in bilateral joint postures than the right hemisphere </plain></SENT>
