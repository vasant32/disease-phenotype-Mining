<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-seven patients with 148 plaques producing more than 50% internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-nine plaques were in asymptomatic patients, 35 were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo>, 19 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> and 25 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a CT brain scan and the presence of ipsilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Images of the plaques obtained with an ATL Ultramark-4 Duplex scanner (7.5 MHz high resolution probe) were transferred to a computer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using an image analysis program a histogram for each plaque was obtained with the number of pixels plotted against the grey scale (0-225) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median of the grey scale was used as a measure of echogenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-three (36%) of the 148 plaques were associated with ipsilateral CT <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plaques with a grey scale median more than 32 (echogenic) were associated with an incidence of 11% (7/64) CT infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, plaques with grey scale median below or equal to 32 (echolucent) were associated with 55% (46/84) incidence of CT infarction (chi 2 = 30.35, p &lt; 0.001, relative risk = 22, 95% confidence interval from 4.7 to 108) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study indicates that computer analysis of carotid plaque can identify high-risk carotid plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The potential of such analysis in the identification of asymptomatic high-risk patients should be explored in further studies </plain></SENT>
