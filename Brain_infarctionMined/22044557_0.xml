<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine whether 30 days of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5959">irbesartan</z:chebi>, initiated within 96 h of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> improves recovery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-one patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> participated in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> (80 mg) vs. placebo, and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5959">irbesartan</z:chebi> (150 mg) vs. placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two patients (randomized 53 ± 22 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms) completed the 30-day primary outcome follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The primary outcome, maximal brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size at days 3 and 30 measured by perfusion computed tomography, was not significantly altered by random assignment to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5959">irbesartan</z:chebi> (1088 (IQR 216, 2594) mm² at day 3, compared with 398 (144, 2053) mm² among the placebo group, P= 0.79 controlling for baseline values; and 822 (159, 1717) mm² at day 30, cf 280 (76, 1330) mm²; P=0.63); or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> (454 (107, 1765) mm² cf 825 (265, 2509) mm² at day 3; P= 0.33; and 462 (43, 1399) mm² cf 280 (128, 1559) mm² at day 30, P= 0.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no other significant differences among the treatment groups with the exception of: • high sensitivity C-reactive protein concentrations, which were lower in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5959">irbesartan</z:chebi> treatment group at day 30 (mean difference 12.6 mg/L; 95% CI: -25.1, - 0.1; P= 0.048); and • the mean cerebral blood flow in the affected cerebral hemisphere at 30 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which was significantly reduced by random assignment to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5959">irbesartan</z:chebi> compared with placebo in both the affected cerebral hemisphere (-7.5 mL/100 mL/min (95% CI: -1.7 to - 13.4, P= 0.01)) and in the unaffected hemisphere (- 7.3 mL/100 mL/min (95% CI: - 1.3, -13.4; P= 0.02)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">Atorvastatin</z:chebi> therapy was well tolerated, but <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5959">irbesartan</z:chebi> therapy was associated with an increased rate of withdrawal from therapy (n=10 (29%), compared with n=3 (9%) who withdrew from placebo, P= 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5959">irbesartan</z:chebi>, initiated on day 3 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, did not appear to substantially modify <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth </plain></SENT>
