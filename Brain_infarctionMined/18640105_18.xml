<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> has protective effects against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about its mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hence, in the present study the neuroprotective potential of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> was investigated in middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) induced focal cerebral IR injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> 100 and 300 mg/kg i.p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>60 min after MCAO significantly diminished <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and improved neurological deficit in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nissl staining showed that the neuronal injury was significantly improved after being treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">Curcumin</z:chebi> significantly decreased the expression of caspase-3 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A higher number of TUNEL-positive cells were found in the vehicle group, but they were significantly decreased in the treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that the neuroprotective potentials of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> against focal cerebral ischemic injury are, at least in part, ascribed to its anti-apoptotic effects </plain></SENT>
