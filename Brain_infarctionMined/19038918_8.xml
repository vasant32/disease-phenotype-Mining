<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, the presence of a hyperdense middle cerebral artery sign on unenhanced CT is a specific but insensitive indicator of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to determine whether the hyperdense basilar artery (HDBA) sign has utility in detecting <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and predicting outcome in patients presenting with signs and symptoms of posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Unenhanced CT scans obtained within 24 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in 95 patients with suspected posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three neuroimagers blinded to clinical outcome and results of the concurrent CT angiography (which served as the reference standard) rated presence of HDBA sign on a 5-point scale for level of certainty (1=definitely absent; 5=definitely present) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Short-term outcome was measured by discharge National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) scores; long-term outcome was measured by 6-month modified Rankin score (dichotomized, poor outcome defined as modified Rankin score &gt;2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The following variables were correlated with short-term and long-term outcome by univariate analysis: HDBA sign, age, sex, time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to imaging, admission NIHSS, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, tobacco use, and thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Variables showing correlation with P&lt;0.1 were included in multiple regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using a level of certainty cutoff score of &gt;/=4 (probable, definite), HDBA sign had 71% sensitivity, 98% specificity, 94% accuracy, 83% positive predictive value, and 95% negative predictive value for basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, factors significantly correlated with discharge NIHSS were: admission NIHSS (P&lt;0.0001; r=0.77), HDBA sign (P=0.01), and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Factors showing significant correlation or association with poor long-term outcome were age (P=0.02), admission NIHSS (P=0.007), HDBA sign (P=0.02), and history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (P=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio of HDBA sign for predicting poor long-term outcome was 5.3 (95% CI, 1.1-33.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In multiple regression analysis, the only independent predictors of discharge NIHSS were admission NIHSS (P&lt;0.0001) and HDBA sign (P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Significant independent predictors of poor long-term outcome were age (P=0.02), admission NIHSS (P=0.008), history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (P=0.03), and HDBA sign (P=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients presenting with a high pretest probability of posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> based on clinical symptoms, the presence of the HDBA sign on unenhanced CT is a strong predictor of basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and both short- and long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
