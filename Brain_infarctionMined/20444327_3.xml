<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to investigate the effects of green tea <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26195">polyphenols</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTPs</z:chebi>) on the permeability of blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>), and the expression of caveolin-1 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase Â½ (ERK1/2) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was established by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were randomly divided into control and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi> groups, and both included four time points of interest: <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occluded for 0 hour, 1 hour, 2 hours, and 4 hours groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining and Longa's score were used to determine the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Evans blue (EB) content in the brain tissue was measured to observe the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and western blot assessment were used to detect expression of caveolin-1 in microvessel fragments of cerebral ischemic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blot was also used to examine ERK1/2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTPs</z:chebi> significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, ameliorated the neurological deficit, and reduced the permeability of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTPs</z:chebi> also obviously reduced the levels of caveolin-1 mRNA and protein expression as well as the expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in microvessel fragments of cerebral ischemic tissue, which were enhanced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: These data were the first to show that <z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTPs</z:chebi> can decrease the elevated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability in the ischemic region, and the protective effects for cerebral injury may be related to the reduced expression of caveolin-1 and phosphorylated ERK1/2 </plain></SENT>
