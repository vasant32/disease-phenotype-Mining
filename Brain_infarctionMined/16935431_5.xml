<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined temporal profiles of survival-and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-related signals, Bad phosphorylation, release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi>.c), activation of caspase 3 and DNA fragmentation in the brain during and after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in mice, and then examined the effect of tacrolimus on these signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>C57BL/6J mice were subjected to transient MCAo by intraluminal suture insertion for 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tacrolimus (1 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered immediately after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were biphasic increases in the release of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi>.c in the ischemic core and penumbra; with the first increase toward the end of the occlusion period and the second increase 3-12 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tacrolimus significantly inhibited the increase of cytosolic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi>.c during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylated Bad, Ser-136 (P-Bad(136)) and Ser-155 (P-Bad(155)) were detected 30 min after MCAo and after reperfusion in the ischemic cortex, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tacrolimus increased P-Bad(136) during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and prolonged P-Bad(155) expression after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tacrolimus also decreased caspase-3 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated DNA nick-end labeling-positive cells, and reduced the size of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study provided the first evidence that the neuroprotective action of tacrolimus involved inhibition of biphasic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi>.c release from mitochondria, possibly via up-regulation of Bad phosphorylation at different sites after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
