<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is widely known that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> through its complication, i.e. heart and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, is at the present the main cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The atherosclerotic process has been shown in correlation with <z:mp ids='MP_0001548'>hyperlipemia</z:mp> especially as far as the plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50404">lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> level is concerned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A preminent role in removing cholesterol from tissues and arterial walls then in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is played by a specific class of plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi>, the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoproteins</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-colesterol level seems to have an inverse correlation with the atherosclerotic disease it is of primary importance to define a reliable and reproducible technique to measure it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of the aims of this paper was to examine the different methods now available for such a determination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This analysis has underlined the discrepancy among the reference values reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the authors agree that only the simultaneous measurement of total and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-colesterol levels is of prognostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Personal studies are here reported on the relationship between total and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-colesterol levels and risk factor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The two mentioned laboratory analyses have been performed on blood samples from 250 between male and female human subjects of different age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The obtained results show that the highest <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-colesterol concentrations determined by a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> precipitation procedure with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34674">dextran sulphate</z:chebi>, are typical in the first ten years of life both in male and in female, while the lowest levels of plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> have been evintiated during the fifth decade of life, when the total cholesterol and the risk of cardiovascular complications rich the highest values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a following set of investigations, the already examined blood parameters together with the risk factor values have been examined in two groups of subjects, the first one represented by adult healthy persons the second one by patients of similar age from a cardiovascular division </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean levels of total colesterol have been shown similar in both the experimental groups, while plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> is significantly higher in the healthy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This discrepancy is the cause of definitively higher risk factors in the hospitalized patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the reported data furtherly stress that the total cholesterol values do not give "per se" any indication of atherogenic risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>They are useful only when examined together with the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>From that the opportunity to always include the determination of plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> screening lipemic profiles </plain></SENT>
