<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With reference to this mode a series of more than 200 brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> which had happened 1 day to 56 years before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, was examined systematically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to the results the ceroid variants do not only succeed one another chronologically but they also represent histochemically successive phases of development which correspond to the progressive auto-oxidation of unsaturated <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of the different stages is chronologically defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During this development cortical and subcortical macrophages show different speeds in the ageing process of their pigments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is no evidence for an essential participation of proteins in the maturation of the ceroid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Not during any phase of development is the reaction pattern identical with that of neuronal and glial lipofuscin </plain></SENT>
