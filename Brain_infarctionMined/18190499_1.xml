<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of small deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (SDIs) based on clinical and noncontrast CT findings is often employed to triage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients for emergent endovascular interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few studies have evaluated the accuracy of &lt;6 hours presentation with lacunar clinical syndromes in predicting the presence of a SDI and the absence of large vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients were identified with symptoms suggestive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) and CT performed within 6 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and absence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> on imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were given a diagnosis of SDI if they met the defined clinical and CT criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses of large vessel occlusion absent (LVOA) and final diagnoses of SDI versus non-SDI incorporated hyperacute multimodal MRI data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 64 patients, 15 were diagnosed as SDI at &lt;6 hours based on clinical/CT criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of 15 patients (93%) had a final diagnosis of LVOA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten of 15 (67%) had a final <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-DWI-confirmed diagnosis of SDI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical/CT diagnosis of SDI showed sensitivity of 44%, specificity 97%, positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) 93%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 61% in predicting LVOA and sensitivity 83%, specificity 90%, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> 67%, and NPV 96% compared to the final diagnosis of SDI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most patients incorrectly diagnosed with SDIs harbored small cortical branch <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Diagnoses of SDI &lt;6 hours from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> based on a classic lacunar syndrome and CT criteria show only modest predictive value in predicting the presence of a small-vessel territory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> but perform fairly well in identifying patients without large-vessel occlusions amenable to endovascular therapy </plain></SENT>
