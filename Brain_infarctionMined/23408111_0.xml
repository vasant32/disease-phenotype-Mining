<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of (PPARγ) and its co-regulators in cerebrovascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we have demonstrated that (PPARγ) activation by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> significantly inhibited both oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation-induced cerebral vascular endothelial cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>-triggered cerebrovascular damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this finding, selective (PPARγ) genetic deletion in vascular endothelial cells resulted in increased cerebrovascular permeability and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in mice after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we screened for (PPARγ) co-regulators using a genome-wide and high-throughput co-activation system and revealed KLF11 as a novel (PPARγ) co-regulator, which interacted with (PPARγ) and regulated its function in mouse cerebral vascular endothelial cell cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, KLF11 was also found as a direct transcriptional target of (PPARγ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, KLF11 genetic deficiency effectively abolished <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> cytoprotection in mouse cerebral vascular endothelial cell cultures after oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation, as well as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>-mediated cerebrovascular protection in a mouse middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mechanistically, we demonstrated that KLF11 enhanced (PPARγ) transcriptional suppression of the pro-apoptotic microRNA-15a (miR-15a) gene, resulting in endothelial protection in cerebral vascular endothelial cell cultures and cerebral microvasculature after ischaemic stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our data demonstrate that recruitment of KLF11 as a novel (PPARγ) co-regulator plays a critical role in the cerebrovascular protection after ischaemic insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is anticipated that elucidating the coordinated actions of KLF11 and (PPARγ) will provide new insights into understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying (PPARγ) function in the cerebral vasculature and help to develop a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
