<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MRS of both cases clearly demonstrated an increased level of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> and decreased N-acetylaspartate (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>), resulting in a high <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> ratio (LNR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Case 1 without thrombolysis therapy revealed that the area where LNR was less than 1.0 did not develop to infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was also confirmed by MRS of case 2, who received an interventional reperfusion 4 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stags of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, on LNR greater than 1.0 on H-MRS may predict the margin of the infarcted region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elevation of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> in the non-infarcted cerebral hemisphere has not been reported before, and farther evaluation is necessary </plain></SENT>
