<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To address the role of oxidative DNA damage in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> lacking reperfusion, we investigated DNA base and strand damage in a rat model of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Contents of 8-<z:chebi fb="10" ids="29191">hydroxyl</z:chebi>-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and apurinic/apyrimidinic abasic sites (AP sites), hallmarks of oxidative DNA damage, were quantitatively measured in nuclear DNA extracts from brains obtained 4-72 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA single- and double-strand breaks were detected on coronal brain sections using in situ DNA polymerase I-mediated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16284">dATP</z:chebi> nick-translation (PANT) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end-labeling (TUNEL), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Levels of 8-OHdG and AP sites were markedly elevated 16-72 h following MCAO in the frontal cortex, representing the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region, but levels did not significantly change within the ischemic core regions of the caudateputamen and parietal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PANT- and TUNEL-positive cells began to be detectable 4-8 h following MCAO in the caudate-putamen and parietal cortex and reached maximal levels at 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PANT- and TUNEL-positive cells were also detected 16-72 h after MCAO in the lateral frontal cortex within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> border, where many cells also showed colocalization of DNA single-strand breaks and DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, levels of PANT-positive cells alone were transiently increased (16 h after MCAO) in the medial frontal cortex, an area distant from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that within peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> brain regions, oxidative injury to nuclear DNA in the form of base and strand damage may be a significant and contributory cause of secondary expansion of brain damage following permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
