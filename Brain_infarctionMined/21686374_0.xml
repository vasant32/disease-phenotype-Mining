<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, for the diagnosis of IVLBCL, invasive biopsies are generally performed in main organs, such as the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a case of IVLBCL in which an early diagnosis was enabled by skin biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient in this case had cauda equine syndrome and had developed multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She received six cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>) treatment and is currently in complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the macroscopic level, her lesions resembled senile <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp>, commonly observed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eruptions of this type are not currently recognised as IVLBCL lesions and might easily be overlooked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In cases in which IVLBCL could be suspected, an active search and biopsy of <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>, including an eruption of this type, are useful for early diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
