<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results of randomized studies showed that decompressive hemicraniectomy performed in this group of patients could be beneficial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First experiences with implementation of hemi-craniectomy in patients with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> centre are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between August 2007 and July 2008, four patients with hemispheric brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> complicated by malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> underwent decompressive hemicraniectomy within 72 hours from symptoms <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> severity was assessed with the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was assessed 3, 6 and 12 months after the event using the modified Rankin scale (mRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the first patient, the neurosurgical procedure included only decompressive hemicraniectomy, whereas in the other three duraplasty was performed additionally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The first patient died 23 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Another died at four months after the event, due to infectious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The remaining two patients presented severe functional disability 12 months after the procedure (mRS score 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Decompressive surgery with duraplasty can be a life-saving procedure for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, the presented cases are among the first reported cases of hemispheric ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treated with decompressive hemicraniectomy in Poland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Extended follow-up with a larger group of patients is necessary to assess long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
