<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence indicated that the PRKCH gene was a susceptibility gene for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> in a Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to explore the association of the gene with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> in a population of Chinese Han ancestry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 280 consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> patients and 306 unrelated population-based controls that had been matched for age and sex were examined using a case-control design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of PRKCH gene (rs3783799 and rs2230500) were genotyped with ligase detection reaction (LDR) and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype analysis were also investigated between these two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall alleles and genotype frequencies were similar between cases and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant association was detected with the gene polymorphisms mentioned above and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e>; no significant difference was found with haplotype analysis between these two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the two SNPs showed significant association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> in the whole subjects before and after adjustment for conventional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of PRKCH differed largely from those in the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that variants in the PRKCH gene are not the risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> in individuals from a small population of Chinese Han ancestry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Population differences in alleles and haplotype frequencies as well as LD structure may contribute to the observed differences between populations </plain></SENT>
