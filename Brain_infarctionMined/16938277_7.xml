<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ADNF-9, NAP, and ADNF-9+NAP were injected (intraperitoneally; i.p.) as a single dose immediately after the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> levels, neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were evaluated in both hemispheres (carotid ligated or nonligated) 72 h after the hypoxic-ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histopathological evaluation demonstrated that ADNF-9 and NAP significantly diminished number of "apoptotic cells" in the hippocampal CA1, CA2, CA3, and gyrus dentatus regions in both hemispheres (ligated and nonligated) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ADNF-9 and NAP, when administered separately, significantly preserved the number of neurons CA1, CA2, CA3, and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus, when compared with vehicle-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The density of the CA1, CA2, and dentate gyrus neurons was significantly higher when combination therapy with ADNF-9+NAP was used in the carotid ligated hemispheres </plain></SENT>
