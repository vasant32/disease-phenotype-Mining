<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied whether MetS risk factors alter cerebral metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighteen non-smoking men (36 +/- 6years) were stratified into two groups according to their risk of developing the MetS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Individuals in the Risk group had a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, were pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, had mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and higher fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and serum insulin compared to the Control group with no risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi>, total <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> (tCr), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17268">myo-inositol</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were studied in the thalamus, frontal cortex, and frontal white matter with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was 13% higher (p &lt; 0.01) in the Risk group, but the brain <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were comparable between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the Control group, the thalamic tCr correlated with the thalamic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level (r = 0.81, p = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the Risk group, the tCr was 17% higher (p = 0.006) and correlated with the fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration (r = 0.78, p = 0.013), but not with the thalamic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the increased tCr level in the Risk group suggests that a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> together with MetS risk factors alters thalamic energy metabolism </plain></SENT>
