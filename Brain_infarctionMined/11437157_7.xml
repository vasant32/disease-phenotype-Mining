<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the frequency of aCL and the risk of recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and other vascular events in a series of 242 consecutive patients aged over 60 years, admitted for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> underwent aCL immunoreactivity (ELISA; measured by IgG antiphospholipid, GPL, units) and transoesophageal echocardiography and were later examined or contacted by telephone (mean 2.33 +/- 1.25 years, max </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients (21 %) had at least l0 GPL units aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between these and the other patients in the results of transoesophageal echocardiography, including mitral or aortic valvular thickening, atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, atrial spontaneous contrast, strands, and aortic plaques thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None had IgG higher than 80 GPL units or was positive for anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with at least 10 GPL units more often had a past history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> than patients lower aCL level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the incidence of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 4.5 per 100 person-year in patients with more than 10 GPL units, and 2.7 per 100 person-year in those with more than 10 GPL units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis for any vascular events showed no differences between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast to young patients, elderly patients with 10 or more GPL units aCL and negative for anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I do not seem to have a higher risk of vascular events </plain></SENT>
