<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have used a photochemical reaction in vivo to induce reproducible <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After the intravenous injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi>, a potent photosensitizing dye, an ischemic lesion was formed by irradiating the left parietal convexity of the exposed skull for 20 minutes with green light (560 nm) from a filtered <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> arc lamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals were allowed to survive from 30 minutes to 15 days after irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early microscopic alterations within the irradiated zone included the formation of thrombotic plugs and adjacent red blood cell stasis within pial and parenchymal vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Scanning electron microscopy revealed frequent platelet aggregates adhering to the vascular endothelium, often resulting in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carbon-black brain perfusion demonstrated that occlusion of vascular channels progressed after irradiation and was complete within 4 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histopathological examination at 1, 5, and 15 days revealed that the associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> evolved reproducibly through several characteristic stages, including a phase of massive macrophage infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in this model is initiated by <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of small blood vessels, the fact that the main pathological features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are consistently reproduced should permit its use in assessing treatment regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, the capability of producing infarction in preselected cortical regions may facilitate the study of behavioral, functional, and structural consequences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
