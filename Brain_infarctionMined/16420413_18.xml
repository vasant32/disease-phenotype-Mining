<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the action of the EP4/EP3 <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> 1-hydroxyPGE1 (1-OHPGE1) in modulating transient ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>C57BL/6 mice were pretreated 50 min before transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery with an intraventricular injection of 1-OHPGE1 (0.1, 0.2, 2.0 nmol/0.2 microL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain damage 4 days after reperfusion, as estimated by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, was significantly reduced by more than 19% with 1-OHPGE1 in the two higher-dose groups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To further address whether protection also was extended to neurons, primary mouse cultured neuronal cells were exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Co-treatment with 1-OHPGE1 resulted in significant neuroprotection (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To better understand potential mechanisms of action and to test whether changes in cyclic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> monophosphate (cAMP) levels and downstream signaling would be neuroprotective, we measured cAMP levels in primary neuronal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brief exposure to 1-OHPGE1 increased cAMP levels more than twofold and increased the phosphorylation of extracellular-regulated kinases at positions Thr-202/Tyr-204 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a separate cohort of animals, 1-OHPGE1 at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> doses tested produced no significant effect on the physiological parameters of core body temperature, mean arterial pressure and relative cerebral blood flow observed following drug treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Together, these results suggest that modulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> receptors that increase cAMP levels and activate extracellular-regulated kinases 1/2 caused by treatment with 1-OHPGE1 can be protective against neuronal injury induced by focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
