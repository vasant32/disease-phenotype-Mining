<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study endeavored to investigate the effects of early and late treadmill training after ligation of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 60 min right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups: 24 h group, 2 week no training group, early training group (training started 24 h post MCAO), and late training group (training started 1 week post MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured morphometrically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A five-point neurological evaluation scale was used to assess the neurological status of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rats sacrificed 24 h post MCAO had the largest <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (177.8+/-14.3 mm(3)) and the highest neurological score [2(1-4)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early treadmill training was found to have significant effects in reducing brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and in improving neurologic function when compared with spontaneous recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the same effects cannot be found in late training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on the present findings, we would encourage early treadmill training for ischemic brain recovery </plain></SENT>
