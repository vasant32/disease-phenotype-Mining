<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study aimed to clarify clinicoradiological features of recurrent BI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 374 consecutive BI patients (231 men and 143 women) were admitted to our department between 2007 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recurrent BI was defined as a prior history of BI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">Cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) risk profile, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism subtypes and Bamford subtypes were compared between the first BI and the recurrent BI group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes of the first BI and preventative medication were analyzed in recurrent BI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recurrent BI existed in 72 patients (40 men and 32 women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age of the recurrent BI group was significantly older than the first BI group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In comparison to the first BI group, the recurrent BI group had a high frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.01) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> comorbidity (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recurrent rates were increased significantly in cardioembolic patients as compared to the first BI patients (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bamford BI subtypes did not differ between both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean recurrent interval (SD) was 3.1 (2.3) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Approximately half the patients experienced recurrent BI less than 2 years after the first BI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Antiplatelet agents were used in 33 patients and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> was used in 12 patients as preventative medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The remaining 27 patients had no prevention therapy by self-cessation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Nine <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> users were controlled poorly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There were no significant correlations between the first and recurrent Bamford subtypes in recurrent BI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicated that the recurrent frequency of BI was 19.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Causative profile of recurrent BI suggested elderly age (â‰¥65 years), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, prior history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, cardioembolism, 2 years poststroke, insufficient treatment of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and self-cessation of preventative medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Thus, physicians should pay more attention to these aspects for prophylaxis of recurrent BI in poststroke patients </plain></SENT>
