<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify the A1166/C polymorphism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> type 1 receptor (AT1R) gene in patients with essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> complicated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (BI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: AT1R genotyping with polymerase chain reaction-restrictive fragment length polymorphism was performed in 70 normotensive subjects, 72 hypertensive patients without cardio-cerebrovascular diseases(EH-NCCVD) and 70 hypertensive patients with BI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the polymorphism of AT1R gene and plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequencies of C allele in the two groups of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were higher than that in the health controls, respectively (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>But there was no significant difference in the frequency of C allele between the two groups of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation was observed between the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) and AT1R gene A1166/C polymorphism in hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: AT1R gene contributes to the development of essential hypertensive, but not to the incidence of BI in the hypertensive </plain></SENT>
