<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has been reported to accelerate collateral growth (arteriogenesis) at the circle of Willis in rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the effect of GM-CSF on leptomeningeal collateral growth has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of unilateral common carotid artery (CCA) occlusion and GM-CSF treatment on leptomeningeal collateral growth in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult mice were subjected to unilateral CCA occlusion or sham surgery followed by an alternate-day regimen of GM-CSF (20 microg/kg) or saline injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On day 7, latex perfusion was performed in 1 set of mice to visualize the leptomeningeal vessels, and the number of Mac-2(+) monocytes/macrophages on the dorsal surface of the brain was counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In another set of mice, on day 7, permanent ipsilateral middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion was performed, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Leptomeningeal collateral growth was observed after CCA occlusion, and that was enhanced by GM-CSF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An increase in the number of Mac-2(+) cells on the surface of the brain occurred after CCA occlusion and was enhanced by GM-CSF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven days after CCA occlusion, GM-CSF treatment decreased the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size attributable to subsequent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After CCA occlusion, GM-CSF treatment enhanced leptomeningeal collateral growth and decreased the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in mice </plain></SENT>
