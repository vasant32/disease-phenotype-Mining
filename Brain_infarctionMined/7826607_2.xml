<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, focal ischemic lesions were produced in rats by permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The animals were killed from 1 to 48 h postlesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Leakage of plasma proteins across the blood-brain barrier into the infarcted area was visualized with immunostaining 2-3 h after the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is earlier than in most previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Entry of plasma proteins into ischemic neurons was seen 3 h after permanent occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, while reliable changes were not seen until 12-24 h in sections stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (H &amp; E) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ischemic neurons stained for plasma proteins irrespective of their morphological appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Even cells that appeared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> with H &amp; E staining were positively labeled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The technique may be used to diagnose very early ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
