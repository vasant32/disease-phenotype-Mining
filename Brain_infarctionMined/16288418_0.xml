<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurologic complications occur in 20-40% of patients, and the brain is the main location of IE extracardiac complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To analyse clinical characteristics of the neurologic complications found in patients with IE, focused on the diagnostic and prognostic aspects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied retrospectively the cases of patients with IE admitted to the Hospital de Valme and Hospital de la Merced between 1998 and 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laterly, patients with and without neurologic manifestations were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty episodes of IE were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neurological complications occurred in 12 patients (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent neurologic manifestation was unilateral hemi <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp>, which occurred in seven cases (58.3%), three cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009676" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">confusional state</z:e> (25%) and two patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> (16.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain infarction</z:e> was the most common lesion found in neuroimaging, in 6 patients (50%), followed by 2 cases (16.6%) of brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and without significant findings in the cases left </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cases with neurologic complications had significantly higher mortality (p &lt; 0.001) and higher frequency of negative blood culture (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic complications of IE are frequent during the evolution of the disease, and they still constitute a significant problem in clinical practice because they often are not accurately diagnosed and significantly increase patients' mortality </plain></SENT>
