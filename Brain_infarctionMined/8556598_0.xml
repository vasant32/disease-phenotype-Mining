<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to delimit prognostic factors in supratentorial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> based on data obtained upon hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied two series of patients, the first being 150 with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and the second 135 having intracerebral haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed: age, Glasgow and Canadian scales, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and urgence haemogram and the size of the lesion across its greatest diameter using computerized tomography (CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up time was until <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or one year after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those who lived longer than one year after were subclassified according to the Rankin scale as &lt; 3 and &gt; or = 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference between those who survived for less than one month and those surviving more than one year: their age (p &lt; 0.01), average score on the scale (p &lt; 0.001) and size of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (p &lt; 0.05) or haematoma (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Rankin subgroups &lt; 3 and &gt; or = 3 also differed significantly with regard to age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Noteworthy were the unfavourable data: Glasgow &lt; 10 points and Canadian &lt; 5 points, in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> &gt; 6 cm and haematomas &gt; 4 cm in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We comment on other evolutionary variables which may influence prognostic assessment such as clinical deterioration or CT sensitivity of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> depending on the carry-out time </plain></SENT>
