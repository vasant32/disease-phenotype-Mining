<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The ECGs of 26 patients following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and 18 control patients with various orthopedic problems, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> without primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, were examined to characterize the dynamic behavior of uncorrected QT interval in relation to changing RR interval during physiotherapy effort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ECG waveforms were analyzed to extract beat-to-beat QT and RR intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on performing multiple cross-correlations, the relationship between the RR and QT intervals was calculated using the following general formula QTi = c RRib-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Linear regression was performed on the logarithms of QT and RR measurements to estimate the constant (a = log c) and the slope (b) values, reflecting the dynamic change of QT during physiotherapy effort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Having these two values, the dynamic QT extrapolated to a heart period of 1 second (QTcd) was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was found that the mean slope (b) of the linear regression line in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> group was significantly lower than in the control group (0.26 +/- 0.08 vs 0.33 +/- 0.08, P &lt; 0.02), and the constant (a) was significantly higher (1.83 +/- 0.21 for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> vs 1.61 +/- 0.23 for the controls, P &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found in QTcd values between the two groups (386 +/- 27 ms for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> vs 392 +/- 25 ms for the controls, P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, hemispheric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> seems to result in alteration in the autonomic activity during exercise manifesting itself as distorted dynamic behavior of the QT interval </plain></SENT>
