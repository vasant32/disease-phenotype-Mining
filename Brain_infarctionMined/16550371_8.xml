<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A survey exploring attitudes and experiences of organ donation activities was sent to half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> anaesthetists and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> neurosurgeons in Sweden (n=644) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total response rate was 67%; 69% from the anaesthetists and 54% from the neurosurgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neurosurgeons had more experiences of caring for potential donors and requesting donation than anaesthetists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven percent of the anaesthetists were not confident with clinical neurological criteria for brain incarceration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine per cent found donation activities solely burdensome, and 14% wanted an external team to take over the donation request </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A quarter regarded the request definitely as an extra load on the family, and more than half of the respondents had refrained from asking in emotionally strained situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine per cent had a neutral approach to relatives when requesting donation while 38% had a pro-donation approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six per cent terminated ventilator treatment for a potential donor without waiting for total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lack of resources in the ICUs resulted in not identifying a possible donor according to 29% of respondents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Knowing the prior wish of the deceased was regarded as the single most important factor that facilitated the work with organ donation for the intensivists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The identified obstacles (neutral approach of donation request, ethical problems concerning the potential donor and the relatives, varying competence in diagnosing total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, and lack of intensive care bed resources) require tailored efforts in order to increase organ donation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Checking these factors can be used as a quality control when analysing donation activities at hospitals </plain></SENT>
