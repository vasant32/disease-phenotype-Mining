<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One group of rat pups had previously been subjected to HI in utero (HI + HI); the other had been subjected to a sham operation (SH + HI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and neuronal injury were measured 24 h after the neonatal HI insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As indicated by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining and pathological examination, cerebral damage was significantly less in the HI+ HI group than in the SH + HI group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Induction of heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) was immunohistochemically detectable in both groups 24 h after the neonatal HI, and was proportional to the extent of tissue damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ischemic tolerance phenomenon observed in immature rats does not appear to be a result of induction of hsp70 </plain></SENT>
