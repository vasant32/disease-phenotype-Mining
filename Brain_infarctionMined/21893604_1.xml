<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a register-based study among nearly 3 million working women and men (30-64 years in 1990) with a 12-year follow up (1991-2002) for mortality from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (4886 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Income was measured as annual registered income from work in 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gender-specific Cox regressions were applied with adjustments for sociodemographic covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age-adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of lowest versus highest income quartile was 1.80 (1.48-2.19) for any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 1.68 (1.29-2.17) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> and 2.23 (1.53-3.22) for BI in women, and the corresponding figures for men were 2.12 (1.92-2.34), 2.02 (1.77-2.31), and 2.09 (1.77-2.46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for covariates attenuated these associations to 1.69 (1.33-2.15) for any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 1.56 (1.14-2.14) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> in women and to 1.98 (1.74-2.24) for any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 1.77 (1.44-2.19) for BI in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, adjustment for covariates amplified the estimates to 2.36 (1.52-3.66) for BI in women and to 2.05 (1.73-2.44) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mortality was highest in the lowest income group, with a gradient for the intermediate groups, in both women and men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk of mortality from BI was highest in women with the lowest income and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> was highest in men with the lowest income </plain></SENT>
