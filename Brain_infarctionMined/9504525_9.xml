<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lesions were visualised with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The exclusion criteria were history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e>, premorbid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e>, insufficient cooperation, primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>visual impairment</z:hpo>, left-handedness, and age over 75 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 63 (10) years and the mean number of years of education was 8 (1&amp;#xb7;7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>33 of the patients were men and 19 were women.A factor analysis computed for the whole group of patients showed that each of the six conventional <z:chebi fb="55" ids="167099">BIT</z:chebi> subtests had high loadings (0&amp;#xb7;89) on the factor that accounted for 85% of their total variance, indicating that neglect could be measured as a solitary defect with these tests.5 20 patients did not reach the original cut-off score in at least two of the six <z:chebi fb="55" ids="167099">BIT</z:chebi> subtests (the criterion for neglect) and were considered as neglect patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The table shows the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of each subtest and their combinations in the detection of the neglect patients from the total series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To reduce the number of tests and still identify as many neglect patients as possible, we looked for high sensitivity and specificity (both 0&amp;#xb7;80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To simplify the procedure, we modified the criteria so that one failure in any test of two or three subtest combinations instead of the original two would mean neglect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The best single test was star cancellation, which misdiagnosed four neglect patients and three non-neglect patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The best two-subtest combination was figure copying and line bisection, misclassifying one neglect patient and five non-neglect patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The best three-test combination (line crossing, letter cancellation, and line bisection) failed to identify only one patient in each group </plain></SENT>
