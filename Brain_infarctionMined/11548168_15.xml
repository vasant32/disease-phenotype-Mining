<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in daily routine CT is still the preferred imaging modality for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose of this study was to determine how early and reliably ischaemic brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> can be identified by CT and DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three neuroradiologists, blinded to clinical signs but aware that they were dealing with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, analysed the CT and DWI of 31 patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We calculated kappa-values to analyse inter-rater variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ratings were compared with follow-up studies showing the extent of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combined assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> observers gave positive findings in 77.4% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CT examinations, with kappa = 0.58 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Areas of high signal were seen on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> DWI studies by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> observers (kappa = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Estimation of the extent of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> based on DWI yeilded kappa = 0.70 and that based on CT kappa = 0.39 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DWI was much more reliable than CT in the detection of early ischaemic lesions and we believe that it should be used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> before aggressive therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
