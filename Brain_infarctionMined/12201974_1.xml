<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Thirty-one pigs underwent 75 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> at 20 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histological examination of the brain was performed, and slides of brain cortex were evaluated for apoptotic activity by the TUNEL method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten animals died during the first postoperative day and 21 survived until the seventh postoperative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain cortex <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were found in animals that survived 7 days and these were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median histopathological score among animals that died on the first postoperative day was 3.0 (range, 2-4), whereas it was 4.0 (range, 2-4) among survivors (p = 0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The apoptotic index was particularly high in the area of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, whereas only a few TUNEL-stained cells were observed in noninfarcted areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The apoptotic index was nil in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pigs that died in the first postoperative period, whereas it was 2.0 (range, 0-6) among the animals that survived until the seventh postoperative day (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The apoptotic index was significantly increased in brain cortex <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of animals that survived 7 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e>, whereas only a few apoptotic cells were observed in noninfarcted areas of these animals as well as in animals that died on the first postoperative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to elucidate the timing of development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> and whether neuroprotective strategies targeting the apoptotic process may mitigate brain damage </plain></SENT>
