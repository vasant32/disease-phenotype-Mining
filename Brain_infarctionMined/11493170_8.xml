<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There have been few reports on bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> and vertebrobasilar occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, previous reports have not emphasized the inner ear as a localization of bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the presentation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the distribution of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery as sudden <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018775" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bilateral hearing loss</z:e> with minimal associated signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: Case report and tertiary care hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENT: A 66-year-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> developed sudden bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0009900'>deafness, unilateral</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> 7 days before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo>, facial <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans showed hyperintensities in the right lateral pons and right middle cerebral peduncle and a possible abnormality of the left middle cerebellar peduncle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A magnetic resonance angiogram showed moderately severe stenosis of the distal vertebral artery and middle third of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient's right limb coordination and gait improved steadily over several weeks, but there was no improvement in hearing in his right ear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The relatively isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> as well as the severity and persistence of the hearing loss led us to conclude that the hearing loss in this case was likely due to prominent hypoperfusion of the internal auditory artery, with labyrinthine infarction as the earliest event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Vertebrobasilar occlusive disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of sudden bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
