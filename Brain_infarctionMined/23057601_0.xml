<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There are little data on the etiology of multiple brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (MBI) and their impact on clinical outcome in young patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 548 MRI-imaged patients (15-49 years) with a first-ever ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ischaemic lesions were categorized into three groups: single lesions, MBI in one or &gt;1 circulation territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were unfavorable 3-month modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of ≥ 2 and, during long-term follow-up (mean 8.20 ± 4.01 years), recurrent ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from any cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multiple brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> occurred in 185 patients (33.8%; mean age 39.2 ± 8.2), of which 144 patients (26.3%) had lesions located in a single territory and 41 patients (7.5%) in multiple territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with MBI in a single territory were more likely than patients with single lesions to have a high-risk source of cardioembolism (CE) (9.0% vs. 3.0%; P = 0.001), large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (8.3% vs. 4.9%; P = 0.012), vertebral (22% vs. 10%; P &lt; 0.001) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissections</z:e> (8.3% vs. 6.3%; P = 0.036), and MBI in multiple territories a high-risk source of CE (34% vs. 3.0%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjusted for age, gender, baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity, size of the largest lesion, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype, MBI remained independently associated with an unfavorable 3-month outcome (odds ratio 2.84, 95% confidence interval 1.22-6.61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, MBI had independent influence on the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (hazard ratio 3.75, 1.58-8.86), but not on recurrent ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the elderly, young <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients have a distinct <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> etiology underlying MBI, being an independent indicator of poor short-term outcome and long-term risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
