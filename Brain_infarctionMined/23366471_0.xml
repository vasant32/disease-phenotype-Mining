<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One limitation of this model is its high variability in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cerebral blood flow (CBF) information after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596298" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular occlusion</z:e> may reflect the availability of collateral circulation, which serves as a key factor for brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) is a valuable tool for full-field imaging of CBF with high spatial and temporal resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we investigated the spatio-temporal changes of CBF in rat MCAO <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model using our self-developed real-time LSCI system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CBF images of adult male Sprague Dawley rats (n=13) were recorded before surgery, during first 1.5 hours after surgery, and 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We compared the CBF changes of different functional vessels during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the ipsilateral hemisphere, CBF of veins and arteries both decreased as expected, while CBF of veins increased after occlusion in the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we found a linear correlation between early-stage CBF after occlusion and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, which can be utilized for surgery guidance to improve the uniformity of rat MCAO <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models </plain></SENT>
