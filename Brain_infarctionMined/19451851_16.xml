<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to identify risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurologic injury in children undergoing ECMO to aid CPR (E-CPR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using data reported to the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Multi-institutional data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Patients &lt;18 years of age undergoing E-CPR during 1992-2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: None </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We defined <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurologic injury as the occurrence of brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> identified by ultrasound or computerized tomography imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 682 E-CPR patients, 147 (22%) patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurologic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in 74 (11%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in 45 (7%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> in 45 (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The in-hospital mortality rate in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurologic injury was 89% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a multivariable logistic regression model, pre-ECMO factors including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> (odds ratio [OR] 0.46 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.28-0.76]) and pre-ECMO blood pH &gt; or =6.865 (&gt; or =6.865-7.120; OR 0.49 [95% CI 0.25-0.94]; pH &gt;7.120; OR 0.47 [95% CI 0.26-0.85]) compared with pH &lt;6.865 were associated with decreased odds of neurologic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During ECMO, neurologic injury was associated with ECMO complications including <z:mp ids='MP_0001182'>pulmonary hemorrhage</z:mp> (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.1-3.4), dialysis use (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.4-4.0), and CPR during ECMO support (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.6-3.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic injury is a frequent complication in children undergoing E-CPR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e>, less severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001942'>metabolic acidosis</z:hpo> before ECMO, and an uncomplicated ECMO course have decreased odds of sustaining neurologic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Providing effective CPR and inclusion of brain protective therapies on ECMO should be considered in the future to improve neurologic outcomes for patients undergoing E-CPR </plain></SENT>
