<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The value of FDG-PET in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> is currently investigated in clinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is only limited information on the usefulness of FDG-PET in the evaluation of distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present prospective investigation was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of FDG-PET in the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After intravenous injection of 220 +/- 50 MBq F-18-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> PET acquisition was carried out using an ECAT ART scanner (CTI Siemens) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Images were reconstructed using a filtered backprojection with a Hanning filter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PET data were analyzed by visual interpretation of coronal, sagittal and transversal slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PET scans were interpreted by two experienced nuclear medicine physicians without prior knowledge of the results of other imaging studies or clinical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Between March 1997 and July 1998 whole-body PET was performed in 417 patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>402 patients were used for statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on conventional brain imaging with CT (occasionally MRI), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e> were suspected in 17 patients (prevalence 4.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For FDG-PET alone, sensitivity was 82% (14/17) and specificity 38% (14/37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, diagnostic accuracy of FDG-PET in detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e> was 93.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The low specificity of FDG-PET can be explained by reduced tracer uptake mainly due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> in this group of elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that due to its low specificity FDG-PET is not useful for the evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e> in the primary staging of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
