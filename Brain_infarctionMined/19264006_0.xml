<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In accordance with other Western countries, there has been a decline in mortality rates from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, concomitantly with a decline observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> mortality </plain></SENT>
