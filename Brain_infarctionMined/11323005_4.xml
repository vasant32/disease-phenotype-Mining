<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of pretreatment with two direct thrombin inhibitors, melagatran and inogatran, was evaluated in a rat model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was induced by photochemical reaction after an injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">Rose Bengal</z:chebi> and focused posterior and to the right of the intersection of the coronal and sagittal sutures on the intact calvarium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A single oral dose of melagatran (30 micromol/kg) significantly reduced the volume of the cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> by 53% (P&lt;.05) compared with control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, following intravenous inogatran (6 micromol/kg) or oral inogatran (100 micromol/kg), the volume of the cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> decreased by 83% and 19%, respectively, compared with control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study showed that experimental focal ischaemic infarction, elicited by photochemically induced endothelial cell damage, can be significantly reduced with melagatran and inogatran, direct thrombin inhibitors </plain></SENT>
