<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the pharmacological properties of 3-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-aminothiophene <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35692">dicarboxylic acid</z:chebi> (3-MATIDA) by measuring second messenger responses in baby hamster kidney cells stably transfected with mGlu1a, mGlu2, mGlu4a or mGlu5a receptors and ionotropic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>-induced depolarizations in mouse cortical wedges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>3-MATIDA was a potent (IC(50)=6.3 microM, 95% confidence limits 3-15) and relatively selective mGlu1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When tested on mGlu2, mGlu4 or mGlu5 receptors its IC(50) was &gt;300 microM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When tested in cortical wedges, however, 3-MATIDA was also able to antagonize AMPA or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> responses with an IC(50) of 250 microM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When present in the incubation medium of cultured murine cortical cells, 3-MATIDA (1-100 microM) significantly reduced the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of neurons induced by 60 min of oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD), even when added up to 60 min after OGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A similar neuroprotective activity was observed when 3-MATIDA was present at 10-100 microM in the medium of rat organotypic hippocampal slice cultures exposed to 30 min OGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Systemic administration of 3-MATIDA (3-10 mg/kg, immediately and 1 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) reduced the volume of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> following permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results show that 3-MATIDA is a potent and possibly selective mGlu 1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> that may be considered as a novel prototype neuroprotective agent </plain></SENT>
