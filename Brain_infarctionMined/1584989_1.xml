<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The time courses of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and capillary morphometric changes in the ischemic lenticular nucleus, caudate nucleus and insular cortex were then determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Volume changes of ischemic foci were studied morphometrically using an enzyme histotopochemical acid phosphatase stain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the first 4 hours extension (or spread) of the ischemic area was small and constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over the next hours, the ischemic focus increased in volume, becoming maximal in the lenticular nucleus in 24 hours and in the caudate nucleus in 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the lenticular nucleus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> developed 4 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and was characterized by a decrease in capillary diameter and an increase in mean intercapillary distance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the caudate nucleus and insular cortex, in the first hours after clipping the medial cerebral artery, capillary diameter and volume increased and intercapillary distance decreased </plain></SENT>
