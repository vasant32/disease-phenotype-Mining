<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Filament occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) is a well accepted animal model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Advantages of the model are relatively long occlusion times and a large penumbra region that simulates aspects of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we use two-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> and confocal microscopy in combination with regional measurement of blood flow using laser speckle to assess the spatial relationship between the borders of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> ischemic territory and loss of dendrite structure, as well as the effect of reperfusion on dendritic damage in adult YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) and GFP (green fluorescent protein) C57BL/6 transgenic mice with fluorescent (predominantly layer 5) neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By examining the spatial extent of dendritic damage, we determined that 60 min of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion produced a core with severe structural damage that did not recover after reperfusion (begins approximately 3.8 mm lateral to midline), a reversibly damaged area up to 0.6 mm medial to the core that recovered after reperfusion (penumbra), and a relatively structurally intact area ( approximately 1 mm wide; medial penumbra) with hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Loss of structure was preceded by a single ischemic depolarization 122.1 +/- 10.2 s after occlusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion of animals after 60 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was not associated with exacerbation of damage (reperfusion injury) and resulted in a significant restoration of blebbed dendritic structure, but only within approximately 0.6 mm lateral of the dendritic damage structural border </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In summary, we find that recovery of dendritic structure can occur after reperfusion after even 60 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, but is likely restricted to a relatively small penumbra region with partial blood flow or oxygenation </plain></SENT>
