<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among them, derivatives of 3S-(-)-4 such as 3a, 3f, and 3g which had certain zwitterionic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13248">anilides</z:chebi> showed high affinity to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-glycine binding site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The absolute configuration of 3S-(-)-4 was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In particular, 3g (SM-31900) was found to be a highly active glycine <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> for both in vitro and in vivo assays (K(i) = 1.0 +/- 0.1 nM, ED(50) = 2.3 mg/kg, iv) and also showed high selectivity for the glycine site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, 3g was soluble enough in aqueous media (&gt;10 mg/mL at pH 7.4) to use for medications by intravenous injection </plain></SENT>
