<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main holdup of this drug is that most of the benefits are reported with a very narrow time window for intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we investigated whether <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> could protect the brain against ischemic damage using a model of 2-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The time course of blood <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> after i.p. administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50144">sodium pyruvate</z:chebi> (400 mg/kg) was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were treated with the drug or with vehicle 45 min after reperfusion following 2-hour <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tissue ATP content was determined 5 and 10 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured at days 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neurological score was evaluated before and after treatment in the different experimental groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">Pyruvate</z:chebi> prevented the drop of cortical ATP induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the ipsilateral cortex and ameliorated the neurological deficit at 5 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, supporting some beneficial effects of the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, these effects were not sustained at 10 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> failed to significantly reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and the neurological deficit at 24 and 48 h, in spite of some trend to smaller infarction after <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, under the present experimental conditions, systemic administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50144">sodium pyruvate</z:chebi> at 3 h after the beginning of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> exerted only a transient benefit but not a persistent protection against brain damage </plain></SENT>
