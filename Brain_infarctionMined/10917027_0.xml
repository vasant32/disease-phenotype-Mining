<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To investigate the influence of silent ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> (silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (SBI) and periventricular hyperintensity (PVH) on cognitive function and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, we studied MRI and cognitive tests in 27 healthy elderly people (above 65 years old) for 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined Okabe's Scale for verbal intelligence, Koh's Block Design Test for performance intelligence and Zung's Self-rating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On MRI, lesions with high intensity on T2-weighted image and low intensity on T1-weighted image, and which were larger than 3 mm were diagnosed as SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The PVH was classified into 5 grades (0-4), and we divided the subjects into the PVH 0-1 group and the PVH 2-4 group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> using the ventricular area index (VAI) (the ratio of ventricular area to intracranial area at the level of lateral ventricle) on MRI by NIH image 1.55 (Macintosh) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The SBI group and the PVH 2-4 group showed significant decline in Okabe's Score, and Koh's IQ, increase in <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> and VAI during six years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the non-SBI and the PVH 0-1 group showed a decline only in Okabe's score, and an increase in VAI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of change in VAI was significantly higher in the subjects with SBI than those without it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant difference in the VAI change rate between the PVH 2-4 group and the PVH 0-1 group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Silent ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> such as SBI and PVH may have significant influence on decline of cognitive functions and progression of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> even in healthy elderly people </plain></SENT>
