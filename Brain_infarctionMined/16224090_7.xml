<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The shape and exact size of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> have been investigated only postmortem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent imaging techniques based on triangulation and connectivity can now be used for 3D segmentation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The shape and size of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was investigated using these techniques in 10 cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> with subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> (CADASIL) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We segmented 102 lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on T1-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The surface of the corresponding set of voxels was computed as a mesh of triangles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, the shape of each lesion in 3D was visually analyzed by 2 investigators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The volume of lesions ranged from 10.5 to 1146 mm, with 93% of them having a volume &lt;500 mm; 83% lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> had a spheroid or ovoid shape, but 17% presented as sticks, slabs, or with a complex shape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lesions with multiple components appeared larger than the others, and a tail extension was noticed in 13 of 102 lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the following: (1) most lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in CADASIL have a volume far below one third of that of a sphere of 15 mm in diameter, the upper limit currently used for their identification on 2D imaging; (2) a significant proportion of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> have a shape distinct from the spheroid-ovoid <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>; and (3) lesions with a complex shape may result from the involvement of the largest small arteries, confluence of ischemic lesions, or secondary tissue degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The segmentation of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> appears promising to better understand the pathophysiology of tissue lesions secondary to small vessel diseases </plain></SENT>
