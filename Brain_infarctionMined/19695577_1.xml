<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study was to investigate factors associated with dilation of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and basilar artery (BA), which reflect the anterior and posterior circulation respectively, and to examine if these arteries are affected differently by specific factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The diameters of ICA and BA were measured using T2-weighted magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) images at the level of the brainstem in 304 outpatients, with the maximal width of the flow void taken as the diameter for each artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The association between the diameters and clinical data including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The same analysis was performed for the BA/ICA ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis adjusted for confounding factors including gender and age showed that a lower eGFR was independently associated with dilation of both the ICA (beta coefficient -0.148, P=0.0135) and the BA (beta -0.219, P=0.0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HbA1C was independently associated with a greater BA/ICA ratio (beta -0.183, P=0.0015) but eGFR did not show this association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was significantly more frequent (P=0.0353) in patients with a BA/ICA ratio higher than the mean, compared to those with a lower BA/ICA ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Kidney dysfunction was shown to be a dilative factor for the anterior and posterior circulation as reflected by the ICA and BA diameters, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association of the BA/ICA ratio with HbA1c suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> may affect each circulation differently </plain></SENT>
