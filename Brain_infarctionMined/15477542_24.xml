<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate if this relationship is disrupted after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: BOLD activity during tactile exploration of objects was measured with fMRI at 1 week (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo>), 2 to 4 weeks (early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>), and after 1 month (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>) after the first completed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> affecting the sensorimotor cortex in eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional integrity of the motor cortical output system was assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Early after infarction the BOLD-response occurred in the adjacent cortical vicinity related to finger movements of the affected hand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, during the early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage there was a transient lack of this activation despite clinical improvement of hand function and preserved motor evoked potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The BOLD activity reappeared after further improvement in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a transient hemodynamic-electrical decoupling in the post-ischemic cerebral cortex during the early phase of spontaneous clinical recovery </plain></SENT>
