<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA), an inhibitor of endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase, is a marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elevated circulating ADMA concentrations have been associated with systemic and carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, an elevated risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and magnetic resonance imaging white-matter hyperintensities (WMHs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relation of plasma ADMA to subclinical vascular brain injury has not been previously studied in a middle-aged, community-based sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 2013 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free Framingham offspring (mean+/-SD age, 58+/-9.5 years; 53% women), we related baseline plasma ADMA levels (1995-1998) to subsequent brain magnetic resonance imaging measures (1999-2004) of subclinical vascular injury: presence of silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (SBIs) and large white-matter hyperintensity volumes (LWMHs; defined as &gt;1 SD above the age-specific mean) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prevalences of SBIs and LWMHs were 10.7% and 12.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analyses adjusting for age, sex and traditional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors, higher ADMA levels were associated with an increased risk of prevalent SBIs (odds ratio [OR] per 1-SD increase in ADMA=1.16; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.33; P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed that participants in the upper 3 age-specific quartiles (Qs) of plasma ADMA values had an increased prevalence of SBIs (OR for Q2-Q4 vs Q1=1.43; 95% CI, 1.00 to 2.04; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of SBIs in Q1and Q2-Q4 was 8.3% and 11.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of LWMHs did not differ according to ADMA concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Higher plasma ADMA values were associated with an increased prevalence of SBIs, after adjustment for traditional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, ADMA may be a potentially useful new biomarker of subclinical vascular brain injury, which is an important correlate of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
