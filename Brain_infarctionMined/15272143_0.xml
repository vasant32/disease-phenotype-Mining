<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diallelic Bam HI RFLP polymorphism in 5' flanking region p53 gene was studied in 96 patients with carotid atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from Moscow population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging was conducted on day 7 after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The manual morphometry and "Osiris" morphometric hardware (by the Hospital of the University of Geneva) were used for assessment of the infarction volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The predominance of small-size infarctions (&lt; 40 cm3) was revealed in patients with (-/-) Bam HI RFLP p53 genotype versus patients with (-/+) (X2 = 19.7; P &lt; 0.001) and (+/+) (X2 = 12.288; P &lt; 0.001) genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to the Bayesian's statistics, in patients with (-/-) p53 Bam HI genotype the development of a small-size infarction in atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> can be prognosticated with probability more than 65% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A significant association between p53 gene Bam HI RFLP polymorphism and the infarction volume was found in patients with carotid atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from Moscow population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results additionally confirm that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> plays an important role in the formation of ischemic brain lesion and that drugs with anti-apoptotic properties may prove beneficial in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
