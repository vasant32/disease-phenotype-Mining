<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of CMB in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the association between poststroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (PSD) and CMB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort of 235 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> admitted to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit of a university-affiliated regional hospital in Hong Kong was recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the index <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, a research assistant administered the locally validated 15-item Geriatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PSD was defined as a Genetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale score of â‰¥7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence and location of CMB were evaluated with MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In comparison with the non-PSD group, PSD patients were more likely to have lobar CMB (33.3% versus 19.9%; P=0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lobar CMB remained an independent predictor of PSD in the multivariate analysis, with an odds ratio of 2.08 (P=0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that lobar CMB may play a role in the development of PSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The importance of CMB in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> survivors and the general elderly population warrants further investigation </plain></SENT>
