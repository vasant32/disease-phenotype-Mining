<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We tried to demonstrate if reperfusion by thrombolysis (rt-PA) and free radical scavenging (U-74389-G) reduces ischemic-reperfusion cerebral injury in a rat model of embolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: 39 female Long Evans rats were embolized in right hemisphere with an autologous clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three groups are considered; A: control (n = 15), B: rt-PA i.v., 20 mg/kg starting 90-120 minutes after embolization (n = 15), C: rt-PA, same dose, and U-74389-G i.v., 3 mg/kg before and after embolization (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Arterial blood pressure, gasometry, glycemia and temperature were controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Volume of cerebral lesion in surviving animals 24 hours was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Autopsy was performed to verify the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in rats which died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mortality: group A: 8/15; group B: 9/15; group C: 8/9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was related to cerebral injury except for five rats which developed peritoneal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> in rats from group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Differences in mean volume of ischemic lesion in group A and B are nosignificant despite a tendency to a reduction after thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this model thrombolysis alone and in association with U-74389-G failed to reduce cerebral lesion and mortality </plain></SENT>
