<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have performed site-directed mutagenesis to identify the amino acids that are essential for <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>/growth factor interaction and for neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Binding to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-acrylic beads was markedly reduced when lysine in position 134 of bFGF was replaced by alanine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wildtype</z:mp> (wt)-bFGF was shown to protect rat primary cultures of embryonic hippocampal neurons against damage caused by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15738">staurosporine</z:chebi> and to reduce the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in mice after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These neuroprotective effects of wt-bFGF could not be shown for the mutant bFGF(K134A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 was significantly reduced in cultured neurons treated with bFGF(K134A) indicating diminished intracellular signaling compared to neurons treated with wt-bFGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, lysine at position 134 of bFGF is essential for bFGF to bind <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, then to interact with its receptor and, subsequently, to protect neurons against damage </plain></SENT>
