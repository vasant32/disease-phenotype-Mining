<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To minimize as much as possible the neurological consequences from hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury, neuroprotective strategies are urgently required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this sense, there is growing interest in the neuroprotective potential of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> after perinatal asphyxia, due to its high efficacy, low toxicity and ready cross through the blood-brain barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty six Wistar rats at postnatal day 7 were randomly assigned to: two hypoxic-ischemic groups: pups with the left common carotid artery ligated and then submitted to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (HI group) and animals that received a dose of 15 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> just after the hypoxic-ischemic event and repeated twice with an interval of 24 hours (HI+MEL group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pups without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> were used as controls (Sham group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven days after surgery, brains were collected and coronal sections Nissl-stained, TUNEL-labeled, or MBP- and GFAP-immunolabeled prior to determining brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, quantify surviving neurons and evaluate oligodendroglial injury and reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of surviving neurons showing a well preserved architecture in HI+MEL group was similar to that observed in the Sham group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, TUNEL-positive cells only appeared in the HI group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ratio of left-to-right hemispheric MBP immunostaining showed a significant decrease in the HI group in comparison with Sham pups, which was restored after <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">Melatonin</z:chebi> also reduced reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, our results suggest that treatment with <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> after neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> led to a neuroprotective effect reducing cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, white matter <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> and reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
