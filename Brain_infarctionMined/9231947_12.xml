<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose was to compare the safety and efficacy of Org 10172 (1250 anti-Xa Units s.c. once daily) and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (5000 IU s.c. twice daily) in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep-vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prophylaxis started within 72 hours of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and continued for at least 9 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To detect DVT, patients underwent a daily 125I-fibrinogen leg scanning which, if found positive, was followed by venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A first computed tomography scan of the brain was performed at screening to rule out cerebral haemorrhage and a second at cessation of treatment to detect any haemorrhagic transformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the 2-3-months' follow-up period the patients were examined for signs and symptoms of DVT or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On an intention-to-treat analysis, DVT occurred in 14.6% of patients receiving Org 10172 and in 19.8% of those receiving <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> during the treatment period (p = 0.392, NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>Pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> was diagnosed in one patient in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Major conversion to a symptomatic haemorrhagic brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was found in one patient in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> occurred in 13.5% of patients treated with Org 10172 and in 6.7% of patients treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (p = 0.135, NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Deaths</z:hpo> were mainly related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0006532'>pulmonary infection</z:hpo> and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, thus considered to be due directly to the clinical status of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>1250 anti-Xa Units of Org 10172 once daily is both safe and as effective as 5000 IU of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> twice daily given for DVT prophylaxis in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
