<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report a series of 20 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the proximal segment (A1) of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical records of patients who had undergone surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> at two institutions between January 1, 1989, and February 1, 2009, were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean patient age was 52.15 years (range 39-69 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 20 patients underwent direct surgery, with clipping or trapping, via standard pterional craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of A1 segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was 0.59% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 16 women and 4 men, showing a strong predominance of this lesion in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> size was 6.95 mm (range 3-10 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients (20%) had multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and three patients (15%) had associated vascular anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among patients whose <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> originated from perforating arteries, dissection sacrificed the perforating arteries in two patients, and the perforating arteries occluded postoperatively in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the patients whose <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> did not originate from perforating arteries, no perforating arteries were sacrificed during dissection, and perforating arteries became occluded in two patients postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups of patients regarding the incidence of injury or occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcomes were as follows: good recovery in 15 (75%) patients, moderate disability in 2 (10%) patients, severe disability in 2 (10%) patients, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 1 (5%) patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The important consideration in surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> is preservation of the perforating arteries, through cautious dissection around the neck or dome and avoidance of direct clip compression, even after releasing the retracted frontal lobe </plain></SENT>
