<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Substantial variability in functional outcome and relatively few factors predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or degree of recovery have been observed in patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such indicators are of great use in the selection of optimal rehabilitation strategies after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although computed tomography (CT) of patients with a clinical diagnosis of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> performed within the first 10 days shows evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in 50% to 60%, the prognostic significance of a visible ischemic lesion on CT is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 633 patients who presented with symptoms consistent with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> between June 1990 and February 1998 were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred fourteen patients imaged with magnetic resonance, 41 patients with nonischemic diagnoses (<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>), 57 patients imaged within 12 hours of ictus, and 17 patients with incomplete follow-up were excluded from the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining 404 patients were divided into 2 groups, depending on the appearance of the CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with a low-attenuation area on the CT scan consistent with an ischemic lesion in an appropriate region of the brain to explain the presenting symptoms were classified as "CT positive." Patients with either a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CT scan of the brain or a scan that showed a lesion in an area inconsistent with the presenting symptoms were classified as "CT negative." A series of known or suspected prognostic factors were recorded for each patient: blood pressure, age, smoking, plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, serum cholesterol level, and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Delay from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to scanning was also noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The authors considered 3 outcome measures: survival time, outcome at 6 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and total length of hospital stay for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six-month outcome was categorized as good (alive at home) or poor (alive in care or dead) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no difference in survival between the 2 groups (P= .29, log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for other significant prognostic factors (age; relative hazard per additional decade 1.67, P&lt; .0001: plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level; relative hazard per additional mmol/l 1.08, P= .03) in a proportional hazards model, presence of visible infarction remained nonsignificant (relative hazard 0.84, P= .40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for the other significant factor (age, P= .0001), there was no significant difference in 6-month outcome between CT positive and CT negative patients (P= .61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Median total length of hospital stay was not significantly different between the 2 groups (CT positive, 9 days; CT negative, 8 days; Mann-Whitney test, P= .29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The authors conclude that in their cohort of patients, having corrected for other prognostic variables, the presence of visible infarction on CT brain scan performed between 12 hours and 30 days of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of lacunar symptoms is not predictive of duration of hospital stay or of longer term outcome </plain></SENT>
