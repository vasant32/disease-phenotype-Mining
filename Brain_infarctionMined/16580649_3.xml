<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since cerebral <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> levels are elevated for many hours in progressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we investigated the novel AMPA <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> ZK 187638 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent models</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> using up to 12 h delays in the start of therapy after permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In rats, ZK 187638 reduced total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 43% and 33% when therapy was started immediately or with a delay of 6 h, respectively, but no effect was observed after a 12 h delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dose-dependent decreases of total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (up to 42%) were measured in mice given the first injection of ZK 187638 6 h after permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the AMPA receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> ZK 187638 has a therapeutic time window of at least 6 h after permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rodents </plain></SENT>
