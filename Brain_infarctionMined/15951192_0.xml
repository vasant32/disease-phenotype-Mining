<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> affects the function and molecular expression of specific muscarinic cholinergic receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our results show that in contrast to the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>-B and A1 <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> receptor systems, the ability of muscarinic receptors to attenuate evoked excitatory responses at vulnerable CA1 synapses is significantly attenuated by 18 h following reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This attenuation in efficacy was restricted to the vulnerable CA1 subfield, as no significant change in muscarinic receptor-mediated attenuation of evoked responsiveness was observed within post-ischemic dentate granule cell synapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression analysis revealed that the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and immunoreactive protein levels for individual types of muscarinic receptors respond differently and uniquely to transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of particular interest is the m4 subtype of receptor, whose <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression levels were significantly diminished within the hippocampus by 12 and 24 h following reperfusion, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As the m4 muscarinic receptor localizes to presynaptic terminals within the hippocampus, a decrease in its expression could account for the impaired functional responsiveness of the muscarinic receptor system following ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results demonstrate that transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> leads to dynamic alterations in the gene expression, protein prevalence, and functionality of muscarinic receptors in the post-ischemic hippocampus at times preceding the degeneration of the vulnerable neurons </plain></SENT>
