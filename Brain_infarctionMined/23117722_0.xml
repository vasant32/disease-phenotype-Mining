<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested the effects of insulin plus tPA combination in a model of focal embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Type I diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">Streptozotocin</z:chebi> was used to produce <z:mp ids='MP_0002056'>Type I diabetes</z:mp> in male Wistar rats for 6 weeks and then embolic focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats were treated with insulin or saline at 1 hour followed by tPA or saline at 1.5 hour after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mortality, infarction, hemispheric swelling, hemorrhagic transformation, and perfusion defects were examined at 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen and activity levels were measured before <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 1.5, 3, and 6 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Early insulin glycemic control alone or tPA thrombolysis alone had no significant effects on ischemic infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, early insulin glycemic control combined with tPA significantly reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and swelling, ameliorated tPA-associated hemorrhagic transformation, and improved plasma perfusion at 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also found that the combination significantly decreased plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen level at 6 hours and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity at 1.5 and 6 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early insulin glycemic control may be beneficial in combination with tPA thrombolysis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> or poststroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
