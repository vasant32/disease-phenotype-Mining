<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The cortex of medial temporal lobe is a group of different allocortical fields which included the hippocampal formation (dentate gyrus, hippocampus proper, and subicular complex) and extrahippocampal cortices (entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is widely accepted that both of them play an important role in memory process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In humans, several reports indicates that damage to the hippocampus alone would lead to a clinically significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e>; when the injuries are more extensive others <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009241" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disorders</z:e>, as those related to visual sphere, make worse the clinic picture, and some of these cases were reported as associative visual <z:hpo ids='HP_0010524'>agnosias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, although evidence from animal studies points to the importance of the extrahippocampal medial temporal lobe cortices in order to recognise visual stimuli, such involvement has not been demonstrated in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 44 year-old male who consulted us because they had lost about of '80% of his vision' after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ophthalmological examination was entirely within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits, but neuropsychological test put in evidence difficulties in the visuo-verbal naming, discrimination of superposed images, recognition of faces and, mainly, in the test of immediate and deferred visual memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anterograde <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> was also revealed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging showed a lesion of left entorhinal, perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We suggest, in relation to anatomical evidences, that isolation of hippocampus is responsible for symptomatollogy of our patient </plain></SENT>
