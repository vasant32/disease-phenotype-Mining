<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL and METHODS: Twenty-four rabbits had their blood pressure and heart rhythms studied daily over 20 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then, the histopathology of the petrosal ganglion was examined in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> and apoptotic neuron density of the petrosal ganglion and blood pressure values were compared statistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean total volume of the petrosal ganglia was calculated as 0.9 ± 0.34/mm3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BP level of control group was 96.1 ± 2.1 mmHg; 116.5 ± 4 mmHg of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (HT) group and 128.1 ± 3.6mmHg in the severe HT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the groups were compared to each other they were significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The level of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-apoptotic neuron in control group was 11,240 ± 802/mm³ -40 ± 6.3/mm³; 9730 ± 148.7/mm³ - 1560 ± 256.2/mm³ in the mild HT group and 6870 ± 378.8/mm³-4240 ± 628.2/mm³ in the severe HT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When the groups were compared to each other there was significantly difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Blood pressure variability observed in this study may be explained by ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> of petrosal ganglia caused by SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of this study suggest that petrosal ganglion <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> has potential implications for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that new treatment strategies should be considered for the treatment of SAH </plain></SENT>
