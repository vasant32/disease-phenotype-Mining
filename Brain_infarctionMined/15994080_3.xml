<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients with moderate or severe head injury that were monitored in our neurosurgical intensive care unit were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The changes in ICP, rCoBF and the relationship of ICP/rCoBF were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with high ICP and low rCoBF, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> improves the rCoBF and decreases the ICP of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When low rCoBF exists, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> may lead to a rapid further decline of rCoBF, however, some hyperemic brains respond well to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Triple-H therapy is suitable for those with low rCoBF without significantly high ICP, which is an abnormal condition considered to be caused by vasospasm </plain></SENT>
