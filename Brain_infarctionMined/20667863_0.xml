<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The configuration of aortic plaque appears to be as important as its thickness when it acts as an embolic source to the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency and clinical predictors of ulcerated plaque at the aortic arch identified using transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were determined, and the association between the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> and recent ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, particularly multiple brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, which appear to indicate embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Aortic and cardiac embolic sources were evaluated using TOE in 360 patients with fresh ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> proven by diffusion-weighted MRI, including 210 patients with a single <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and 150 with multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, as well as in 101 non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> was defined as a crater on the plaque â‰¥2.0 mm in depth and width </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An ulcerated plaque was identified in 10.6% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> versus 2.0% of non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, showing a 5.11-fold higher frequency in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (95% CI 1.51 to 31.96) after adjustment for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After multivariate adjustment for clinical and ultrasonographic features, multiple-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patients had a 7.61-fold higher risk (95% CI 1.99 to 50.43) of having an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> than control patients and a 3.32-fold higher risk (95% CI 1.61 to 7.18) of having an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> than single-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and drinking habit were independently related to the presence of ulcerated plaque in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ulcerated plaque in the aortic arch was associated with the development of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, especially multiple brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, probably involving, at least in part, an embolic mechanism </plain></SENT>
