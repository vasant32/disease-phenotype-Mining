<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order is a mechanism of withholding cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lack of DNR guidelines specific for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may result in many <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients receiving unnecessary and futile resuscitation and ventilator-assisted breathing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective multicenter evaluation of disease-specific criteria for DNR orders in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was initiated using a modified Delphi process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The participants were the Canadian and Western New York <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Consortium members who are closely involved in caring for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and conducting clinical trials at the academic centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Previously published provisional criteria were reviewed by the participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Modifications were made to the criteria until statistically significant agreement (P &lt; .05, z score, or 67% similar answers) was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Disease-specific criteria for DNR orders in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were discussed by 26 physicians in three rounds of the opinion survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An agreement was reached that a "no resuscitation" decision is appropriate when any two of the following three clinical criteria are present (the degree of agreement is given in parentheses): severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (88%, P = .00007), life-threatening brain damage (73%, P &lt; .01), and significant comorbidities (92%, P = .00003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The poor prognosis implied by these criteria should be discussed whenever possible among physician(s), the patient, and family members before the decision to withhold CPR is made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eighty-one percent of the participants agreed that these disease-specific criteria are appropriate for clinical use (P = .0008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Disease-specific criteria for DNR orders were developed to supplement general DNR policies for patients with hemispheric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> during the first 2 weeks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A significant agreement was reached by a panel of physicians that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> should not be resuscitated if these disease-specific criteria are met </plain></SENT>
