<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is not known if there is a relationship between gender and tissue outcome in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to identify whether the proportion of initially ischemic to eventually infarcted tissue was different between men and women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 141 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> who had a baseline MRI obtained within 12 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, a follow-up imaging on Day 4 or later, and diffusion-weighted imaging/mean transmit time mismatch on initial MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lesion growth was calculated as percentage of mismatch tissue that underwent infarction on follow-up (percentage mismatch lost) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analyses explored the effect of gender and other predictors of tissue outcome on percentage mismatch lost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no difference in median percentage mismatch lost between men (19%) and women (11%; P=0.720) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was, however, an interaction between gender and age; median percentage mismatch lost was 7% (0% to 12%) in women and 18% (1% to 35%) in men younger than the population median (71 years, P=0.061) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percentage mismatch lost was not different between men and women â‰¥71 years old (25% in both groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The linear regression model revealed gender (P=0.027) and the interaction between age and gender (P=0.023) as independent predictors of percentage mismatch lost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is an age-by-gender interaction in tissue outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>; brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in women &lt;70 years grow approximately 50% less than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in their male counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings extend the well-known concept that there is a differential age-by-gender effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence, mortality, and functional outcome to the tissue level </plain></SENT>
