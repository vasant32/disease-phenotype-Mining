<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The analyzed literature data from 1,393 IP cases were from the period 1993-2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> anomalies were diagnosed for 30.44% of the investigated IP patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The total number of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> types of anomalies per patient was 1.62 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study there was no significantly higher number of anomalies per patient in females than males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most frequent <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> types of anomalies were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, motor impairment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequently registered <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> lesions found using brain imaging methods were brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophies</z:mpath>, and corpus callosum lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IKBKG exon 4-10 deletion was present in 86.00% of genetically confirmed IP patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> anomalies, similar to the frequency of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> anomalies in IP patients, concurrent with their severity, supports their recognition in the list of IP minor criteria </plain></SENT>
