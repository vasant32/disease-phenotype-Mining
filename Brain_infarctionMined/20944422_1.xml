<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> SH-SY5Y cells and brain slices from rats were subjected to oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD), followed by reoxgenation with and without LNCF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The viabilities of SH-SY5Y cells and brain slices from the rats were 58.5±4.9% and 79.7±5.9% in the group subjected to OGD, and 80.4±0.4% and 97.2±1.9% at 4 µg/ml of LNCF, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LNCF also significantly inhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-associated protein kinase (DAPK) dephosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with LNCF at 4 mg/kg significantly decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size by 79% of vehicle control in the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in vivo model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LNCF is a neuroprotective drug candidate against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
