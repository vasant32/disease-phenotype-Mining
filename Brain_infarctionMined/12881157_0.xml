<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether electroencephalography (EEG) recovery could be considered a reliable marker of brain injury after experimental hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cortical electrical activity was registered before and after a 75-min period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> in 27 pigs that survived 7 days after the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sum of EEG bursts was counted as a percentage of the sum of artifact-free bursts and suppressions, and this percentage was used as a measure of EEG activity in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain infarction</z:e> developed in 13 animals (48.1%), in 12 cases (44.4%) having involved the cortex, in 1 case the thalamus (3.7%) and in another the hippocampus (3.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean EEG burst percentage significantly correlated with the total brain histopathological score (rho = -0.588, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EEG burst percentage from the 2 h 20 min to the 7 h 20 min interval correlated with the total brain histopathological score and with the cortex, brainstem and cerebellum scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean EEG burst percentage rate was higher, but not significantly, among the animals without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (38.5% vs 32.4%), but such a difference was significant at the 3 h 20 min postoperative interval (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean EEG burst percentage significantly correlated with brain <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration at the 1 h interval (rho = 0.387; P = 0.046), brain <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> concentration at the 2 h interval (rho = -0.431; P = 0.025), and the brain <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ratio at the 1 h 30 min interval from the start of rewarming (rho = -0.433; P = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A decreased EEG burst percentage seems to be associated with an increased risk of developing histologically evident brain ischemic injury in the cortex, brainstem and cerebellum after experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
