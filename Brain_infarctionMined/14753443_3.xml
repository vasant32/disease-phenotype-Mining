<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results were compared to findings in the experimental model of transient (for 3 hours) <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the experimental model as well as in the clinical setting development of malignant brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (due to formation of space occupying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>) was predicted by the size of critically hypoperfused tissue and the volume of irreversibly damaged tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The course of malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was characterized by progressive increase in concentrations of excitatory amino acids, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17368">hypoxanthine</z:chebi> and in intracranial pressure, while cerebral perfusion pressure and tissue oxygen tension decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results clearly differentiate a malignant from a benign course of large hemispheric infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The methods can be used to identify patients at risk for formation of space occupying <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and to select patients who could benefit from invasive therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
