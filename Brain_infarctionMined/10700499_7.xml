<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Case fatality rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has declined in most Western industrialized countries during recent decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One possible explanation for this is a decrease in the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore sought evidence for a change in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity and its relationship with case fatality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared the severity of symptoms among first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients in 2 population-based prospective <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registers maintained during 1972 to 1973 and 1989 to 1991 in Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who were evaluated by study assistants or the investigator during the first week after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms were included in the study, and their severity of symptoms was assessed with the use of comparable scales modified from the Scandinavian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 244 and 594 patients were registered, and a portion of them (155 [63.5%] and 360 [60.6%]) were included in the analyses in the registers for Espoo-Kauniainen from 1972 to 1973 and for 4 separate districts in Finland from 1989 to 1991, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates during the first week among those who were not included did not differ between the registers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The severity of symptoms decreased significantly between the registers in both patients with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> but not in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The severity of symptoms was an independent factor of case fatality at 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The severity of symptoms of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> has decreased and can in part explain the decreased case fatality rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the change in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> may be overestimated due to undiagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> in the first register resulting from the lack of brain CT </plain></SENT>
