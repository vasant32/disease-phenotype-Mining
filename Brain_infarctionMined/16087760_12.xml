<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Occlusion of the polar or the paramedian arteries of the thalamus usually leads to distinct <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> with specific clinical and imaging correlates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, vascular variation is such that in up to one third of humans, the polar artery is missing and its territory taken over by the paramedian arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To provide attention to the corresponding <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> syndrome of combined polar and paramedian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied combined polar-paramedian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarction</z:e> in 12 patients (6 right-sided lesions, 3 left-sided lesions, and 3 bilateral lesions) who were selected from 208 consecutively registered patients with thalamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in the Lausanne <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The clinical manifestation included executive dysfunction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, with eye movement disturbances in 10 patients (5 with right-sided lesions, 2 with left-sided lesions, 3 with bilateral lesions); acutely impaired consciousness in 11 patients (5 with right-sided lesions, 3 with left-sided lesions, 3 with bilateral lesions); <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003537" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aphasic disturbances</z:e> in 8 patients (2 with right-sided lesions, 3 with left-sided lesions, 3 with bilateral lesions), including nonfluent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> in 1 patient (with left-sided lesions); <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> in 5 patients (4 with right-sided lesions, 1 with bilateral lesions); constructional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002186'>apraxia</z:hpo> in 5 patients (with right-sided lesions); mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> in 4 patients (2 with right-sided lesions, 2 with left-sided lesions); <z:hpo ids='HP_0002442'>dyscalculia</z:hpo> in 3 patients (1 with left-sided lesions,1 with right-sided lesions, 1 with bilateral lesions); <z:hpo ids='HP_0002451'>limb dystonia</z:hpo> or asterixis in 2 patients (1 with right-sided lesions, 1 with bilateral lesions); mild hemisensory loss in 2 patients (1 with right-sided lesions, 1 with left-sided lesions); hemiataxia in 1 patient (with right-sided lesions); and ideomotor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002186'>apraxia</z:hpo> in 1 patient (with left-sided lesions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up showed severely disabling, persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> in 7 patients (4 with right-sided lesions, 3 with bilateral lesions) and persistent eye movement dysfunction in 5 patients (2 with right-sided lesions, 1 with left-sided lesions, 2 with bilateral lesions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common etiology appeared to be cardioembolism, followed by artery-to-artery embolism and presumed small-artery disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Key features of this syndrome included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> preceded by a period of altered consciousness, and vertical eye movement disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The severe and persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> may be due to coexisting damage to the anterior and dorsomedial nuclei </plain></SENT>
