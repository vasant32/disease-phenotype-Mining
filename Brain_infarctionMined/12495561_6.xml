<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined this hypothesis by administering <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi> to rats subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) using the intraluminal thread method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffusion MRI (DWI) and perfusion imaging (PI) were acquired during MCAO to assess brain tissue status and haemodynamics, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were intraperitoneally injected with either 10 mg kg(-1) <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi> (n = 5) or vehicle (n = 5) both 30 min and 90 min after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To exclude the possibility that neuroprotection was due to the hypothermic action of the drug, body temperature was maintained at 37-38 degrees C for up to 7 h postischaemia with a feed-back controlled thermoregulatory unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes quantified 2 days after MCAO from T(2)-weighted images were similar in ischaemic control rats and in ischaemic rats treated with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi>-induced enhancement of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A) activity does not effectively protect against neuronal damage that occurs after transient MCAO in normothermic rats </plain></SENT>
