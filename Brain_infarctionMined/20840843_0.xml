<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Protecting neurons in order to minimize brain damage represents an effective approach towards <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapeutics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our recent study demonstrated that 2-(-2-benzofuranyl)-2-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53094">imidazoline</z:chebi> (2-BFI), a ligand for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53094">imidazoline</z:chebi> I(2) receptors, is potently neuroprotective against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, possibly through transiently antagonizing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we further investigated the characteristics and mechanisms of 2-BFI-mediated neuroprotection using a rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model of transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that 2-BFI was most effective at the dose of 3mg/kg in vivo, with significantly reduced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and improved neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lower doses of 2-BFI at 1.5mg/kg, or higher dose of 2-BFI at 6 mg/kg, were either not effective, or toxic to the brain, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rats with 3mg/kg 2-BFI significantly reduced the number of TUNEL positive cells and preserved the integrity of subcellular structures such as nuclear membranes and mitochondria as shown under the electron microscope, confirming neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most interestingly, 2-BFI-treated brains exhibited significant expression of Bcl-2, a gene with a known function in neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these studies not only demonstrated that 2-BFI at 3mg/kg was effective in neuroprotection, but also, for the first time, showed that 2-BFI provided neuroprotection through up-regulating the neuroprotective gene Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>2-BFI can be further developed as a therapeutic drug for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
