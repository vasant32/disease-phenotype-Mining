<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the central cholinergic system affects cognition, little attention has been given to infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that specific damage to the cholinergic pathways due to infarction or white matter hyperintensity (WMH) would deteriorate cognition, especially attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 502 representative elderly participants enrolled in the Osaki-Tajiri Project in 1998 were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants with focal neurologic signs or previous history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> were excluded from the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRIs were available for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants, and the Cholinergic Pathways Hyperintensities scale (CHIPS) was used to assess vascular damage in the cholinergic pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), word fluency test, Digit Symbol test, and digit span test were used to assess global cognitive function and several aspects of attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Participants were divided into 3 groups according to the comorbidity of cerebrovascular disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) and cholinergic involvement: non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> with cholinergic involvement [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>-Ch(+)], and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> without cholinergic involvement [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>-Ch(-)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cognitive scores were compared among the 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> group, the correlations between cognitive function and the CHIPS score were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>-Ch(+) group exhibited significantly lower scores for the Digit Symbol test compared with the other two groups, regardless of the MMSE score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> group, the CHIPS score of white matter changes was irreversibly correlated (ie, biologically meaningful) with the Digit Symbol score in participants age &gt;80 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that silent infarction or WMH may deteriorate attention regardless of global cognitive function by interrupting the central cholinergic pathway </plain></SENT>
