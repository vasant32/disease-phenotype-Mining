<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study, the authors aimed at assessing postischemic brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients suffering from their first <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the territory of the middle cerebral artery were studied retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional MRI volume scans were recorded in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage after infarction and analyzed voxel by voxel intraindividually with the newly developed voxel-guided morphometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Shrinkage of brain tissue was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, not only in the perilesional cortical structures but also in contralateral homolog cortex areas and subcortically in the striatum and thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This secondary shrinkage was not related to the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> or to the clinical outcome of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that delayed brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> involved areas anatomically connected with the ischemic brain lesion but nevertheless was accompanied by a simultaneous improvement of the neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
