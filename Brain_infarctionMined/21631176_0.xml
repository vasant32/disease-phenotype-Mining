<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: When excessive height loss occurs in the elderly, which may be indicated by a cervical-bent posture, examination of the head and neck should be performed to detect common carotid artery (CCA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) aberration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In such cases brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination should be conducted to determine whether infarction is present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationships among bent posture, height loss, aberration of carotid arteries, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> risk with a case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Controls (n = 163) were selected from among patients who had undergone MRI of the brain because of otolaryngologic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Case patients (n = 72) were selected from among those whose primary diagnosis was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in the area served by the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both groups were age-matched between 65 and 84 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neck and pharyngeal cavity in each of the 235 patients were examined to determine whether the carotid arteries exhibited aberration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients' current height and greatest lifetime height were recorded, along with presence or absence of bent posture and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Height loss alone could predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk in 79.1% of patients: 90.2% based on carotid artery aberration and 91.4% when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> risk factors (aberration of carotid artery, height loss, bent posture) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
