<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The results of MRI and CT in 55 patients with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were compared; in 26 of these cases an additional PET examination was obtained in order to study the regional <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MRI was superior to CT, demonstrating 11% more of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, particularly during the first 24 hours, in small lesions confined to the grey or subcortical white matter and in infratentorial ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, only CT was able to show fresh <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, although MRI was the method of choice to demonstrate old blood collections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To characterise the follow up of an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, CT and MRI were similar, except the marginal contrast enhancement sometimes demonstrated by CT studies between the 2nd and 4th week after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PET was inferior to show details because of its poorer spatial resolution, but anyhow had a high sensitivity and provided additional informations concerning secondary inactivations of brain areas not directly damaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally PET was able to demonstrate areas of anaerobic glycolysis and lesions of diminished <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilisation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Small areas of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> in the white matter of the cerebral hemispheres were frequently found in patients with cerebro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e>; they were best shown by MRI, but do not correlate with the extent of vascular stenoses or occlusions, shown by angiography </plain></SENT>
