<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lignocaine was identified as a potential therapy in this context because of the benefit shown for it in other brain injuries for which the received toxic mechanisms are similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve Romney ewes were exposed to 1% CO for 120 min were then infused intravenously with either lignocaine (N=6) or saline for 72 h, and were killed 5 days after the exposure for histological and immunohistochemical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This dose of CO was narcotic and caused white matter brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, with associated glial cell activation, axonal dysfunction and induction of both neuronal and glial <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">haeme</z:chebi> oxygenase and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthetase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the white matter <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was significantly greater in the lignocaine-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of this adverse interaction is neither established here nor is it deducible from other published data; alternative <z:chebi fb="183" ids="50247">antidotes</z:chebi> to CO clearly need to be tested </plain></SENT>
