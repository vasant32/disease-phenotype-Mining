<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hypothesis is that transplanted stem cells enhance endogenous repair mechanisms activated after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recognizing that bilateral reorganization of surviving circuits is associated with recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we investigated the ability of transplanted human neural progenitor cells to enhance this structural plasticity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results show the first evidence that human neural progenitor cell treatment can significantly increase dendritic plasticity in both the ipsi- and contralesional cortex and this coincides with stem cell-induced functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, stem cell-grafted rats demonstrated increased corticocortical, corticostriatal, corticothalamic and corticospinal axonal rewiring from the contralesional side; with the transcallosal and corticospinal axonal sprouting correlating with functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we demonstrate that axonal transport, which is critical for both proper axonal function and axonal sprouting, is inhibited by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and that this is rescued by the stem cell treatment, thus identifying another novel potential mechanism of action of transplanted cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, we established in vitro co-culture assays in which these stem cells mimicked the effects observed in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Through immunodepletion studies, we identified vascular endothelial growth factor, thrombospondins 1 and 2, and slit as mediators partially responsible for stem cell-induced effects on dendritic sprouting, axonal plasticity and axonal transport in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, we postulate that human neural progenitor cells aid recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> through secretion of factors that enhance brain repair and plasticity </plain></SENT>
