<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new method of quantifying regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measurements by N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine (123I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>) SPECT with a rotating gamma camera was designed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By assuming the 2 compartment model of the kinetic for 123I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>, two parameters of rCBF and distribution volume (Vd) of 123I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> from <z:chebi fb="102" ids="22927,29224">brom</z:chebi> brain tissue to blood were obtained by the look-up table method and were derived from two simultaneous equations of the early and delayed images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rCBF values of 3 cases (two <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adults and one brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patient) were calculated by this method and were compared with the values of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) measured at the same time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The average rCBF values in gray and white matter by this method were 40 ml/100 g/min, 27 ml/100 g/min, respectively and correlated significantly to rCBF values by PET (r = 0.598 (p less than 0.001)) </plain></SENT>
