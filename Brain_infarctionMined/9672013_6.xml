<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Our purpose was to determine whether topographic patterns of ischemic damage seen on brain imaging studies are useful for evaluating different mechanisms of infarction and for distinguishing embolic from hemodynamic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Early CT scans were reviewed to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> in the middle cerebral artery territory in 800 patients with either significant obstructive lesions of the internal carotid artery (70% stenosis, n = 17; occlusion, n = 85) or nonvalvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (n = 186) as the only identified source of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ninety-nine CT studies were considered suitable for entry into the final analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The scans were digitized and superimposed on postmortem brain sections by matching algorithms to display the variability of the cerebrovascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cortical borderzone-type infarctions were rare and evenly distributed among patients with cardiac sources of embolism (3.2%) and severe carotid obstructions (3.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, subcortical borderzone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> occurred significantly more often in patients with carotid obstructive disease (36% versus 16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, on computerized segmentation analysis, the topography of infarction was the same in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The current concept that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms can be inferred from interpretation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patterns on brain scans is heavily confounded by the variability in intracranial arterial territory distributions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since individual arterial territories cannot be identified in vivo, interpretation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> topography is invalidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In particular, the cortical wedge-type of borderzone infarction, said to result from hemodynamic compromise in low-flow perfusion territories, is an ambiguous observation and may be seen in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and hemodynamic compromise due to severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
