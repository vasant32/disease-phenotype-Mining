<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: The functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques of diffusion-weighted imaging and perfusion-weighted imaging allow for ultra-early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and concomitant identification of blood flow abnormalities in surrounding regions, which may represent brain "at risk." CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We report two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> associated with ipsilateral high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first patient, a 64-year-old woman with a remote history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and a vertebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, presented with worsening of her preexisting right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The second patient, another 64-year-old woman with known multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> and bilateral high-grade internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, was admitted for the elective microsurgical clipping of an enlarging giant left carotid-ophthalmic artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, she developed right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both patients showed progressive worsening of their neurological deficits in the setting of small or undetected diffusion-weighted imaging abnormalities and large perfusion-weighted imaging defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: After prompt carotid endarterectomy, symptoms in both patients resolved or improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging scans demonstrated resolution or significant improvement in the perfusion abnormalities in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Carotid endarterectomy in the setting of diffusion-weighted/perfusion-weighted imaging mismatch can lead to improvement in cerebral perfusion as evidenced by resolution of the perfusion-weighted imaging lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diffusion/perfusion magnetic resonance imaging may be useful in identifying patients with severe neurological deficits but without large territories of infarction who may safely undergo early surgical revascularization </plain></SENT>
