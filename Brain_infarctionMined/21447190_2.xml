<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although free radicals have been reported to play a role in the expansion of ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e>, the effect of free radical scavengers is still under debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the temporal profile of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> lesion sizes was assessed for more than one year to evaluate the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> which might reduce ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We sequentially enrolled <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients, who admitted between April 2003 and March 2004, into the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi>(-) group (n = 83) and, who admitted between April 2004 and March 2005, into the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi>(+) group (n = 93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> has been used as the standard treatment after April 2004 in our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To assess the temporal profile of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesion size, the ratio of the area [T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (T2WI)/iffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images (DWI)] were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Observations on T2WI were continued beyond one year, and observational times were classified into <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> (1-2 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>), early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (3-6 month), late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (7-12 months) and old (â‰¥13 months) stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits were assessed by the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale upon admission and at discharge and by the modified Rankin Scale at 1 year following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> lesion size was significantly attenuated in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi>(+) group compared with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi>(-) group in the period of early and late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> observational stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, this reduction in lesion size was significant within a year and only for the small-vessel occlusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, patients with small-vessel occlusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> that were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> showed significant neurological improvement during their hospital stay, although there were no significant differences in outcome one year after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">Edaravone</z:chebi> treatment reduced the volume of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and improved neurological deficits during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> period, especially in the small-vessel occlusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
