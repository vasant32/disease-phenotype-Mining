<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Objective: To investigate the efficacy of two doses (300 or 1000 U/kg) of Erythropoietin (Epo) in protecting against neuropathological and behavioral impairments associated with HI injury in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: HI injury (right carotid artery cauterization and 120 min of 8% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>) was induced on postnatal day 7 (P7) and Epo or saline was administered i.p. immediately following the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Auditory processing and learning/memory were assessed throughout development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both doses of Epo provided behavioral protection following HI injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats given 300 or 1000 U/kg of Epo performed significantly better than HI animals on a short duration complex auditory processing procedure, on a spatial <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> assessing spatial learning/reference memory, and a non-spatial water maze assessing associative learning/reference memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Given Epo's extant clinical use (FDA approved for pediatric patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e>), the current results add to a growing body of literature supporting the use of Epo as a potential <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50267">protective agent</z:chebi> for neurological and behavioral impairments following early HI injury in infants </plain></SENT>
