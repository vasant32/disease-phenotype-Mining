<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore studied 17 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hemispheric infarction patients (mean, 90 days) and compared hypoperfusion volumes determined from PWI maps of relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and volume (rCBV), and mean transit time (rMTT) with those measured with (99)Tc-HMPAO single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were also made between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (T(2)-WI) and clinical scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlations were found between lesion location and volume in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three PWI hemodynamic parameter maps with clinical state and lesions on SPECT and T(2)-WI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients, rCBF and rCBV lesions extended well beyond the borders of moderate-sized infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, PWI can delineate regions of abnormal perfusion that reflect the degree of functional impairment and structural damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The finding of peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> hypoperfusion suggests that PWI may have the potential to provide a rapid and non-invasive template against which interventional strategies aimed at promoting functional recovery may be investigated </plain></SENT>
