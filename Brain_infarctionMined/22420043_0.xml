<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Transient ischemia</z:e> was produced by filament occlusion of the proximal middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The right vagus nerve was stimulated starting 30 min after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and consisted of 30-sec pulse trains (20 Hz) delivered to the animal's right vagus nerve every 5 min for a total period of 60 min (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the procedures were duplicated, but no stimulus was delivered, in a control group (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological evaluations were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals at 24 hr, 48 hr, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3 weeks after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion; animals were euthanized; and neuronal damage was evaluated in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin-stained sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ischemic lesion volume was smaller in the VNS-treated animals in comparison with the nonstimulated group (P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the functional score in both treated and untreated groups improved over the 3-week observation period (P &lt; 0.001), there was still a statistically significant improvement reszulting from VNS treatment compared with control animals (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow changes in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> did not differ between the VNS-treated animals (31.9% ± 10.4% of baseline) and control animals (29.9% ± 9.1%; P = 0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of the vagus nerve for only a brief period early in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> provides neuroprotection in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e>, with neuroprotection persisting for at least 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
