<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) provide important pathophysiological information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A PWI&gt;DWI mismatch pattern suggests the presence of salvageable tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, improved methods for distinguishing PWI&gt;DWI mismatch tissue that is critically hypoperfused from benign oligemia are required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated the usefulness of maps of relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF), volume (rCBV), and mean transit time (rMTT) to predict transition to infarction in hyperacute (&lt;6 hours) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with PWI&gt;DWI mismatch patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Semiquantitative color-thresholded analysis was used to measure hypoperfusion volumes, including increasing color signal intensity thresholds of rMTT delay, which were compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> expansion, outcome <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, and clinical status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> rCBF lesion volume had the strongest correlation with final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (r=0.91, P&lt;0.001) and clinical outcome (r=0.67, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a trend for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rCBF&gt;DWI mismatch volume to overestimate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> expansion between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and outcome study (P=0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> expansion was underestimated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rCBV&gt;DWI mismatch (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When rMTT lesions included tissue with moderately prolonged transit times (mean delay 4.3 seconds, signal intensity values 50% to 70%), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> expansion was overestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, when rMTT lesions were restricted to more severely prolonged transit times (mean delay 6.1 seconds, signal intensity &gt;70%), these regions progressed to infarction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> except 1 patient, but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> expansion was underestimated (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rCBF lesion most accurately identified tissue in the PWI&gt;DWI mismatch region at risk of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Color-thresholded PWI maps show potential for use in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> clinical setting to prospectively predict tissue outcome </plain></SENT>
