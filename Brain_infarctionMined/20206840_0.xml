<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: To describe the clinical characteristics and imaging findings of craniocervical dissection in childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, in a tertiary medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this retrospective study, we investigated children (aged 1 month to 18 years) with symptoms and radiographic confirmation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> from January 1996 to January 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> work-up included neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, conventional angiography, and magnetic resonance angiography), cardiac assessment, prothrombotic assays, immunoassays, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> screening, and metabolic screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 95 children with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> was identified as the underlying risk factor in nine patients (7 boys and 2 girls; age range, 1.9 17.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients had focal neurological signs and two had warning symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A history of trauma was noted in two patients and another two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during physical exertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other five patients had spontaneous dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six patients had anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients had posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo>, and the most common location was in the vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Antiplatelet treatment was given to five patients and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> to one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Endovascular treatment was given to one patient with dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient died at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage and another seven had neurological deficits after 9 months to 8 years follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The ninth patient had no residual neurological impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No patients had recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>Arterial dissection</z:hpo> should be considered in childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> is an important factor in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Early investigation and treatment can improve the outcome </plain></SENT>
