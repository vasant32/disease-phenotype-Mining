<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the field of organ transplantation and in brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> patients where intensive-care measures may seem superfluous, the demonstration of cessation of cerebral blood flow by X-ray angiography is generally agreed to be the diagnostic procedure of choice to prove irreversible loss of cerebral function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are, however, certain drawbacks involved in X-ray angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arterial puncture is necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the procedure can be time-consuming, thus making the continuation of adequate intensive-care measures more difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the same time the circulatory condition may worsen causing hypoxic damage to the organ to be transplanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the present paper, the authors report on 13 patients with clinical signs of brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> where cessation of cerebral blood flow was demonstrated atraumatically by intravenous radioisotope angiography (RIA) using a multicrystal gammacamera (Baird Atomic) and the bolus-injection technique with 99m Tc-pertechnetate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had severe brain injuries, 2 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006118" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain tumours</z:e>, 1 patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo> and 1 patient had suffered prepartal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the sinus sagittalis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients EEG recordings were isoelectric </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the time when the RIA was performed systolic blood pressure had decreased to 62-85 mmHg (x = 71 mmHg), while body temperature had declined to 31-36,5 degrees C (x = 34 degrees) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>According to the present results, which were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> confirmed by subsequent bilateral carotid X-ray angiography, total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> is unequivocal when the following criteria are satisfied using RIA: 1. when the radioisotope bolus flows along the common carotid arteries but does not proceed any further than to the base of the skull or around the scalp structures, 2. when, at the moment when the radioactivity outlines the scalp structures, neither the intracranial arteries nor the capillary bed or the venous sinuses are visible, 3. when the time-activity curves across the hemispheres show simply a plateau of low count rate without the activity peak typical for cerebral tracer circulation and 4. when the activity peak, typical for venous outflow, is missing from the time-activity curves for the cervical areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 12 patients with extremely reduced cerebral blood flow it was demonstrated that the RIA findings were clearly different from those obtained at brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, not one of 438 other patients undergoing RIA exhibited the same features which were associated with brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that RIA involves the same degree of safety as X-ray angiography in the diagnosis of total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> but is superior to the latter when the diagnostic procedure has to be performed quickly, thus reducing the risk of any further damage to a prospective donor organ </plain></SENT>
