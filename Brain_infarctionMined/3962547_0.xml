<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Marked stable neurological symptomatology was encountered before the operation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> of a high degree (more than 50%) and the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In functioning EICMA, evolution of stenoses in the system of the internal carotid arteries was found, which was characterized both by their increase (even to the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>) and by their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_624'>involution</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evolution of the stenoses did not occur if the EICMA failed to function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The operation leads to a less marked character of the neurological symptoms or has no particular effect on their dynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changed amplitude and volume of active movements, muscular tone and strength, as well as of speech function, were found to be the most sensitive indicators of the operation efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regression of the neurologic symptoms after the operation was observed even in extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> and long standing of the disease </plain></SENT>
