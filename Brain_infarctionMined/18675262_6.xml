<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The potential for using stem cells to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has garnered much interest, but stem cell therapies must be rigorously tested in animal models before transplantation studies progress to clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An enriched environment enhances transplanted subventricular zone (SVZ) cell migration and functional benefit following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the ability of SVZ cells to survive, migrate, differentiate and promote functional recovery at protracted survival times (e.g., 3 months) has not been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The vasoconstrictive <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> endothelin-1 was injected adjacent to the middle cerebral artery to produce focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven days later, cells derived from the SVZ of adult mice (800,000 cells/rat or vehicle injection) were transplanted into the sensory-motor cortex and striatum, and rats were then housed in enriched or standard conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats in enriched housing had access to running wheels once per week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recovery was assessed in the forelimb-use asymmetry task (cylinder) at 1, 2, or 3 months after transplantation immediately prior to euthanasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transplanted cell survival and migration were quantified using stereology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>Cell phenotype</z:mp> was determined with immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Enriched housing did not enhance survival or migration of transplanted SVZ cells at protracted survival times, and the majority (~99%) of cells died within 2 months of transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cell survival was significantly, and negatively, correlated with microglial activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Many surviving cells expressed an astrocytic phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Functional recovery was not improved at any time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therapies involving transplantation of SVZ cells following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> must be further optimized in order to enhance long-term cell survival and thereby maximize functional benefit </plain></SENT>
