<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The aged SD rats (20-21 months) and the young (4-5 months) were subjected to 3 hours of middle cerebral artery occulsion with the intraluminal filament technique, followed by reperfusion for 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ultrastructure of brain, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone and neuron <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone increased in the aged rats with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> for 3 hours and I/R for 12 hours compared with those in the young </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The brain injury was obviously deteriorated with I/R time longer, which was serious in the aged than that in the young </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neuron <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> increase with I/R time longer, and showed earlier and lasted longer in the aged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The cerebral injury is serious and neuron <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> increase shows early and lasts longer </plain></SENT>
