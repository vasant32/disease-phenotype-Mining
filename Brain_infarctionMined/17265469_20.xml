<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the reaction of microglia in traumatic and ischemic lesions caused by stab wounds and the transient 90-min occlusion of middle cerebral artery in a mature rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although many Iba1(+) resident microglia underwent apoptotic degeneration in the lesion core within 24 hr after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the brain insult as revealed by TUNEL staining, numerous small, round, isolectin B4(+)/CD11b(+)/CD68(+) cells were localized in the lesion core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These small, round cells with diameters of 7-9 mum and polymorph nuclei expressed neutrophil-specific elastase, alkaline phosphatase, and platelet-activating factor receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, they were not activated microglia but neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining with antibodies to inducible NO synthase (iNOS) showed that most iNOS(+) cells were neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results from spatial and kinetic analyses using RT-PCR and immunoblotting were consistent with the immunohistochemical observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the necessity of reevaluating the traditional view on the roles of activated microglia in severe neuropathologic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Note that the traditional microglial markers isolectin B4, CD11b, and CD68 are not specific for microglia, particularly in a pathologic brain </plain></SENT>
