<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Investigators frequently quantify and evaluate the location and size of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesions to help uncover cerebral anatomical correlates of deficits observed after first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is common to discover silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> such as lacunes in patients identified clinically as 'first-ever' <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and it is unclear if including these incidental findings may impact lesion-based investigations of brain-behaviour relationships </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is also debate concerning how to best define the boundaries of necrotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesions that blend in an ill-defined way into surrounding tissue, as it is unclear whether including this altered peri-necrotic tissue region may influence studies of brain-behaviour relationships </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, for patients with clinically overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we examined whether including altered peri-necrotic tissue and incidental silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> influenced either lesion volume correlations with a measure of sensorimotor impairment or the anatomical localization of this impairment established using subtraction lesion analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesions of 41 patients were manually traced from digital T1-MRI to sequentially include the: necrotic lesion core, altered peri-necrotic tissue, silent lesions in the same hemisphere as the index lesion, and silent lesions in the opposite hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lesion volumes for each region were examined for correlation with motor impairment scores, and subtraction analysis was used to highlight anatomical lesion loci associated with this deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For subtraction lesion analysis, including peri-necrotic tissue resulted in a larger region of more frequent damage being seen in the basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For correlational analysis, only the volume of the lesion core was significantly associated with motor impairment scores (r = -0.35, p = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a sub-analysis of patients with small subcortical index lesions, adding silent lesions in the opposite hemisphere to the volume of the index <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> strengthened the volume-impairment association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Including peri-necrotic tissue strengthened lesion localization analysis, but the influence of peri-necrotic tissue and incidental lesions on lesion volume correlations with motor impairment was negligible barring a small index lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, the potential influence of incidental lesions and peri-necrotic tissue on brain-behaviour relationships may depend on the characteristics of the index <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and on whether one is examining the relationship between lesion volume and impairment or lesion location and impairment </plain></SENT>
