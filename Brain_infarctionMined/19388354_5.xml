<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to elucidate the role of HIF-1alpha in neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (HI) brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2), a HIF-1alpha inhibitor, was tested at different dosages (1.5, 15 and 150 mg/kg) and a therapeutic window was tested by administrating 2-methoxyestradiol (15 mg/kg) immediately or 3 hours after the induction of a hypoxic ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size using TTC staining and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> were measured at 48 hours post <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) permeability was examined by IgG staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and HIF-1alpha expression and distribution were studied by immunohistochemistry and western blotting analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: 2ME2 exhibited dose-dependent neuroprotection by decreasing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and attenuating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>2ME2 also attenuated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption, and decreased HIF-1alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotection, however, was lost when 2ME2 was administered 3 hours after neonatal HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The study shows that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> inhibition of HIF-1alpha is neuroprotective in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic injury by preserving <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> integrity and reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
