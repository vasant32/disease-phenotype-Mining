<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: No previous study has investigated the association of kidney dysfunction with silent lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and white-matter hyperintensity (WMH) independent of ambulatory blood pressure (BP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional study involving 1,008 participants (mean age 66 years) from a general population of Ohasama, Japan, was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Calculated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance (CCr) was estimated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In continuous and categorical analyses, the association between CCr and the prevalence of silent lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and WMH was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Silent lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and WMH were detected on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for 24-hour ambulatory BP, sex, age, body mass index, smoking and drinking status, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medication, and histories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On univariate analysis, decreased CCr (continuous variable) and CCr &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (categorical variable) were significantly associated with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and WMH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment, each 1-standard-deviation decrease in CCr (odds ratio = 1.22; p = 0.036) and CCr &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (odds ratio = 1.68; p = 0.007) was significantly associated with a high prevalence of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Even when 24-hour ambulatory BP was within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range (&lt;130/80 mm Hg), CCr &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) was associated with a high prevalence of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (odds ratio = 1.62; p = 0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CCr &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and 24-hour ambulatory BP had additive effects on lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After the same adjustment, the association between CCr and WMH was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CCr is closely associated with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, suggesting that kidney dysfunction in the elderly is an independent risk factor or predictor for silent lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
