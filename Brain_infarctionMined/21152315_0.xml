<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abnormal findings, including silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (SBI), are frequently observed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with nonvalvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (NVAF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, whether there is a relationship between <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi> level and the prevalence of SBI has not been extensively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the association between them was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>235 patients with NVAF, 116 cases of SBI without NVAF and 120 cases of healthy volunteers (control group), who did not receive any antithrombotic therapy, were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi> levels in the NVAF with SBI group were significantly higher than that in the control group (p &lt; 0.01), NVAF without SBI group (p &lt; 0.01) and SBI without NVAF group (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi> levels are lower in the control group than in the NVAF without SBI and SBI without NVAF groups (p &lt; 0.01), however, the latter two groups did not significantly differ from each other for <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi> levels (p &gt; 0.05) There were significant differences in the positive rate of platelet activation between each of the groups (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The positive rate of platelet activation was significantly higher in the NVAF with SBI group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi> might be a novel marker for estimation of the status of platelet activation and the risk factor for SBI <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in NVAF patients </plain></SENT>
