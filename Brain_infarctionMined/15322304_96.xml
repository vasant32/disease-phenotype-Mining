<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intravenously delivered human umbilical cord blood cells (HUCBC) have been previously shown to improve functional recovery of stroked rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To extend these findings, we examined the behavioral recovery and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the presence of increasing doses of HUCBC after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were subjected to MCAO and allowed to recover for 24 hours before intravenous infusion of 10(4) up to 3 to 5x10(7) HUCBC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Behavioral tests (spontaneous activity, step test, elevated body swing test) were performed 1 week before MCAO and at 2 and 4 weeks after HUCBC infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On completion of behavioral testing, animals were euthanized and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HUCBC were identified by immunofluorescence for human nuclei and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers specific for human <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> 3-phosphate dehydrogenase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 4 weeks after infusion, there was a significant recovery in behavioral performance when 10(6) or more HUCBC were delivered (p=0.001 to p=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume measurements revealed an inverse relationship between HUCBC dose and damage volume, which reached significance at the higher HUCBC doses (10(7) cells, p&lt;0.01; 3 to 5x10(7) cells, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, HUCBC were localized by immunohistochemistry and PCR analysis only in the injured brain hemisphere and spleen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results extend previous observations of HUCBC infusion in the MCAO rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model by demonstrating a dose relationship between HUCBC, behavioral improvement, and neuronal sparing </plain></SENT>
