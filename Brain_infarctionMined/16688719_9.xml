<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16348">3-Nitropropionic acid</z:chebi> (3-NPA) is an irreversible inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27093">tricarboxylic-acid</z:chebi> cycle, and provides ischemic tolerance to the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>So far, there have been no reports on the relationship of astrocytic GS and ischemic tolerance by chemical preconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to test the hypothesis that astrocytes serve a pivotal role in 3-NPA-induced chemical preconditioning, we have investigated the temporal profile of GS expression in astrocyte parallel with those of glial fibrillary acidic protein and heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In our rat model of permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, preconditioning with 3-NPA singnificantly reduced the subsequent neurological deficits and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume within 24-72 hours after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, protoplasmic astrocytes in the cortex and striatum were activated in terms of upregulation of GS and more abundant protoplasmic processes with 3-NPA preconditioning, however, HSP70 expression could not be induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the activation of astrocytes and upregulation of GS play an important role in 3-NPA-induced preconditioning but HSP70 does not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In view of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> being imposed on the cerebral ischemic damage, the astrocytic GS may contribute to 3-NPA-induced ischemic tolerance </plain></SENT>
