<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A cross-sectional observation was performed to assess the relationship between the coagulation-fibrinolysis system and the subclinical indicators of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> in a healthy male population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subjects were 445 workers (18.9-49.4, Av </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>36.2 yrs) in viscose rayon manufacturing factories in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coagulation-fibrinolysis parameters determined were D-dimer(DD), thrombin antithrombin III complex (TAT), tissue plasminogen activator (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>), and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following indicators of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> were examined; systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>), stiffness parameter of the carotid artery using ultrasound (beta), pulse wave velocity of the aorta (PWV), and a number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> from brain MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After age-stratification(-29, 30-39, 40+ yrs), the subjects were classified into quartiles by coagulation-fibrinolysis parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean values of SBP and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> and beta and PWV, the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> were compared across these quartiles by means of analysis of variance, chi-square test, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis was also employed to adjust other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, SBP and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> and beta, PWV were elevated by increase of PAI1, TAT, respectively, in the 40+ years group even after adjustment for other possible risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DD had no relation to any of the indicators of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the coagulation-fibrinolysis parameters had any relation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
