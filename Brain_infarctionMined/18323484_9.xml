<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Risks and predictors of IPR and its impact on outcome have not been clearly established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Potential predictors of IPR were evaluated in patients treated in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>Cerebral Aneurysm</z:hpo> Rerupture After Treatment (CARAT) study using multivariate logistic regression with stepwise elimination stratified by treatment modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or disability was defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or a change of &gt;or=2 points on the Modified Rankin Scale at discharge compared to before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IPR occurred in 14.6% of 1010 patients (299 coiled, 711 clipped): 19% with clipping and 5% with coiling (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among those clipped, 31% with IPR had periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or disability compared to 18% without IPR (P=0.001); among those coiled, 63% with IPR had periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or disability compared to 15% without IPR (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and initial lower Hunt and Hess Grade were independent predictors of IPR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For those undergoing coiling, independent predictors of IPR were Asian race, black race, COPD, and lower initial Hunt and Hess Grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among those undergoing clipping, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> and lower initial Hunt and Hess Grade were both independent predictors of IPR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IPR was common in patients undergoing treatment of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, particularly with surgical clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequency of IPR with new disability was similar in the surgical and endovascular treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>Coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, race, COPD, and lower Hunt and Hess Grade were associated with greater risk of IPR, which may reflect differences in vessel fragility but requires further confirmation </plain></SENT>
