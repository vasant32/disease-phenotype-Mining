<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We generated a transgenic mouse overexpressing PGRN and found significantly elevated expression in the forebrain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To explore the neuroprotective capacity of PGRN, we measured brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and functional recovery in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> and transgenic mice following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both neurological and motor functions were rescued by PGRN overexpression, as behaviors recovered more rapidly and to a greater extent following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in PGRN transgenic mice and in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> mice injected with lentivirus-PGRN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were smaller in transgenic mice compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (WT) mice as revealed by computerized image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Glial cells overexpressing PGRN were protected from LPS-induced cytotoxicity in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven days after LPS treatment, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) was lower in glial cells cultured from PGRN-overexpressing mice compared to glia from WT mice, while expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was upregulated in glial cells from transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate consistent and significant improvements in postischemic neurological functions in mice overexpressing PGRN, possibly due to reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine release and elevated anti-inflammatory cytokine release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Progranulin is a promising endogenous neuroprotectant with anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory properties </plain></SENT>
