<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The relationships between single (SLI) and multiple lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (MLI) and occult <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) have not yet been sufficiently evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the prevalence of silent CAD in patients with SLI, MLI and large vessel disease (LVD) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and to identify factors associated with its presence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 125 patients who had suffered their first non-cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> but had no documented history of CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to their pathologies, these patients were assigned to one of three groups: MLI (n=21), SLI (n=50) or LVD (n=54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic CAD was detected by myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Silent CAD was detected in 40 patients (32% of the total); of those that experienced CAD, 15 (30%) were from the SLI group, 7 (33%) had MLI, and 18 (33%) had an LVD <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differences between the groups were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 48 months, the overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence was 8.8%; the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence rates for each subgroup were 6% in patients with SLI, 7% in LVD and 19% in MLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mortality was higher in patients from the MLI and LVD groups (26% and 14%, respectively) than in those from the SLI group (6%; p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found no relationships between the various risk factors and silent CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this exploratory study, SPECT imaging results revealed that the prevalence of abnormal myocardial perfusion was similar in patients with either single or multiple lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and those that had experienced large vessel disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
