<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The medial vestibulospinal tract (VST) is known to mediate the vestibular-evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) in the contracting sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether disruption of the medial VST in the medulla impairs formation of VEMP, we measured VEMP in 14 patients with medial medullary infarction (MMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>VEMP was induced by a short tone burst and was recorded in contracting SCM while patients turned their heads forcefully to the contralateral side against resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Normative data were obtained from 47 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (50%) had abnormal VEMP in the side of the MMI lesion, absent in two, decreased in four, and delayed in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient showed both decreased and delayed response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the seven patients with abnormal VEMP, five had the lesions that extended to the dorsal tegmentum while five of the seven patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> VEMP showed restricted anteromedial lesions mainly involving the pyramids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> (4/7, 57%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000640'>gaze-evoked nystagmus</z:hpo> (6/7, 86%), and ocular tilt reaction/tilt of the subjective visual vertical (4/7, 57%) were frequently observed in the patients with abnormal VEMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The abnormal VEMP in patients with infarctions involving the medullary tegmentum supports that VEMP is mediated by the medial VST descending within the medial longitudinal fasciculus </plain></SENT>
