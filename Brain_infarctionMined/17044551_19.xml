<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Radical removal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo> involving the major dural sinuses remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, whether the fragment invading the sinus must be resected and whether the venous system must be reconstructed continue to be issues of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper the authors studied the effects, in terms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence rate as well as morbidity and mortality rates, of complete lesion removal including the invaded portion of the sinus and the consequences of restoring or not restoring the venous circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study consisted of 100 consecutive patients who had undergone surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo> originating at the superior sagittal sinus in 92, the transverse sinus in five, and the confluence of sinuses in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A simplified classification scheme based on the degree of sinus involvement was applied: Type I, lesion attachment to the outer surface of the sinus wall; Type II, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> fragment inside the lateral recess; Type III, invasion of the ipsilateral wall; Type IV, invasion of the lateral wall and roof; and Types V and VI, complete sinus occlusion with or without one wall free, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lesions with Type I invasion were treated by peeling the outer layer of the sinus wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In cases of sinus invasion Types II to VI, two strategies were used: a nonreconstructive (coagulation of the residual fragment or global resection) and a reconstructive one (suture, patch, or bypass) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gross-total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> removal was achieved in 93% of cases, and sinus reconstruction was attempted in 45 (65%) of the 69 cases with wall and lumen invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The recurrence rate in the study overall was 4%, with a follow-up period from 3 to 23 years (mean 8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate was 3%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> after en bloc resection of a Type VI <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> without venous restoration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eight patients--seven of whom harbored a lesion in the middle third portion of the superior sagittal sinus--had permanent neurological aggravation, likely due to local venous infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six of these patients had not undergone a venous repair procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The relatively low recurrence rate in the present study (4%) favors attempts at complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> removal, including the portion invading the sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The subgroup of patients without venous reconstruction displayed statistically significant clinical deterioration after surgery compared with the other subgroups (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>According to this result, venous flow restoration seems justified when not too risky </plain></SENT>
