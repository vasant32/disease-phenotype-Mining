<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the clinical presentations of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> admitted between 1990 and 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The etiologies of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were also classified using well-established criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 1,061 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, 216 (20.3%) had AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of bedridden state was 41.2% in patients with AF, compared to 23.7% in patients without AF (p &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other measures of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity showed similar disparities between these groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio for bedridden state following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> due to AF was 2.23 (95% CI = 1.87-2.59, p &lt; 0.0005) by multivariate logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic stroke</z:hpo> associated with AF is typically more severe than <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> due to other etiologies, and this increased severity is independent of advanced age and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors </plain></SENT>
