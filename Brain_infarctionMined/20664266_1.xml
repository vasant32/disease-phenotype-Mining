<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: CADASIL is responsible for diffuse hyperintensities in the white matter on FLAIR images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These lesions are often associated with focal lesions in the basal ganglia such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence and significance of diffuse or confluent thalamic hyperintensities (CTH) remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The frequency of hyperintensities on FLAIR images in the thalamus was assessed in 147 CADASIL patients, and signal abnormalities on both FLAIR and T(1)-weighted images were categorized as focal/punctuate or diffuse/confluent by the same reader </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The areas of increased diffusion were also analyzed on apparent diffusion coefficient maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association of CTH with vascular risk factors, the main clinical manifestations of the disease and MRI markers (brain parenchymal fraction, volume of white matter hyperintensities, volume of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and number of microbleeds) was analyzed with generalized linear regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CTH were detected in 12% of the CADASIL subjects in association with hypointensities on T(1)-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CTH corresponded to areas of increased diffusion on apparent diffusion coefficient maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CTH were found significantly associated with age and independently related to the volume of white matter hyperintensities but not to that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> or to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> after adjustment for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant association was found between CTH and global cognitive performances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CTH are observed on FLAIR images in a sizeable proportion of CADASIL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>They are mainly related to the extent of white matter hyperintensities and do not correlate with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>Demyelination</z:hpo> and/or loss of glial cells appear to be the most plausible cause of these confluent signal changes in the thalamus </plain></SENT>
