<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Microangiopathy</z:e> is regarded as an important cause of intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>(<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dot-like low intensity spots on T2-weighted echo planar image(EPI) have been regarded as hemosiderin deposit associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, clinical significance of dot-like hemosiderin spot(dotHS) is still debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we analyzed the number of dotHS on EPI of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To investigate how the dotHS or risk factors contributed to hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e>, the number of dotHS and various risk factors were made a comparison between 20 cases with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e>(lacunar group) and 5 cases with both symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> and symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>(complicated group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to EPI, fluid attenuated inversion recovery image, and T1- and T2-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were performed for differential diagnosis of dot HS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EPI demonstrated that asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> was significantly more frequent in complicated group (60%) than in lacunar group(10%), and dotHS were significantly more frequent in complicated group(100%) than in lacunar group(50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of dotHS of complicated group was 14.6 +/- 4.3, which was significantly larger than that of lacunar group(4.1 +/- 9.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant difference between two groups were founded in other risk factors including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, and smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggested that dotHS was one of the risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> for patients with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e>, and an increasing number of dotHS was one of the predictive factors of symptomatic and/or asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
