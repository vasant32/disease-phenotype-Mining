<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these, 14 patients presented with transitory ischemic attacks, 20 patients with regressing deficit, and 50 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients' health status and functional capacities were estimated on discharge from the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was discovered that in each patient, the maximum level of cerebral isoenzyme in the CSF was in a good agreement with the clinical course of the disease and neurological status in the survived patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It may be concluded that measurements of the concentration of the enzyme in the CSF makes it possible to draw more valid prognostic conclusions in patients with ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disorders of brain</z:e> circulation </plain></SENT>
