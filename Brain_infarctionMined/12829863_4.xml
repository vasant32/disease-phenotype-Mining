<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hyperintense vessel sign (HVS) on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) has been described in hyperacute <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether HVS was more frequent in patients with intracerebral arterial stenoses than in those without stenosis regardless of the presence of a brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this case-control study (19 symptomatic patients with multiple intracerebral arterial stenoses compared with 19 age-matched asymptomatic patients without stenosis), we looked for HVS (ie, focal or tubular hyperintensities in the subarachnoid space) on FLAIR images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the proportion of HVS-positive patients in the 2 groups and evaluated the concordance between the arterial distribution of stenoses on angiogram and that of HVS on FLAIR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HVS was found in 13 of 19 patients (68%) in the study group and 1 of 19 control patients (5.2%) (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concordance between the territorial distribution of stenoses on angiogram and HVS on FLAIR was higher for the right and left middle cerebral artery (kappa=0.6 and 0.63, respectively) compared with the right and left anterior cerebral artery (kappa=0.35 and 0.2, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HVSs were observed in 1 of 7 patients with posterior cerebral artery stenoses on angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HVSs were seen equally in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> focal (7 of 10) or diffuse (6 of 9) cerebral involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the 6 HVS-positive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> confirmed by MRI, additional HVSs were observed in a different arterial territory than that of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although their significance remains unclear, multiple HVSs are more frequently observed in symptomatic patients with multiple intracerebral stenoses than in asymptomatic patients without stenosis </plain></SENT>
