<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the specific influence of unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871399" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">spatial neglect</z:e> (USN) on rehabilitation outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A case-control study in consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> inpatients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Rehabilitation hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: One hundred seventy-eight patients with sequelae of first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, enrolled in homogeneous subgroups, matched for age (within 1yr) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> admission interval (within 3d), and difference because of the presence of USN, evaluated by a specific neuropsychologic battery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received physical rehabilitation: physiotherapy for 60 minutes twice a day (once on Saturday), 6 days a week, within 24 hours of admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>USN-positive (USN(+)) patients received specific treatment of 5, 1-hour sessions per week, for 8 consecutive weeks: (1) visual scanning, (2) reading and copying, (3) copying of line drawings on a dot matrix, and (4) describing a scene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were assessed with neurologic (Canadian Neurological Scale), neuropsychiatric (Hamilton <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Rating Scale), neuroradiologic, and functional (Barthel Index, Rivermead Mobility Index [RMI]) examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Length of stay, efficiency (average daily increase in Barthel Index), effectiveness (amount of potential improvement achieved during rehabilitation) of treatment and percentage of low- and high-response patients calculated on the Barthel Index and the RMI, and percentage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> and return home were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (ORs) of dropouts and of low and high therapeutic response were also quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with USN-negative patients, USN(+) patients had significantly more severe baseline neurologic and functional status at admission, less effectiveness and efficiency on activities of daily living (ADLs) and mobility, a higher percentage of low responders, longer hospitalization, a higher percentage of persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">incontinence</z:e> at discharge (20.5% vs 4.9%), and a lower percentage of high responders and patients returning home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presence of USN was incompatible with a high therapeutic response, for both ADLs (OR= 2.94, 95% confidence interval [CI]= 1.05-8.20; b +/- standard error = 1.08 +/- .52, p&lt; .05), and mobility (OR = 7.16, 95% CI = 2.78-18.44; b = 1.97 +/- .52, p &lt; .001) and was a relevant prognostic factor for institutional discharge (OR = 5.62, 95% CI = 1.63-19.38; b = 1.73 +/-.63, p &lt; .01, accuracy 88.41%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide further strong evidence of the relationship between USN and disability in right brain-damaged patients and of its unfavorable impact on rehabilitation, despite the cognitive training performed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> USN(+) patients </plain></SENT>
