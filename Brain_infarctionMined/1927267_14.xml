<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Extravasated endogenous serum albumin and fibrinogen were identified immunohistochemically in coronal brain sections from normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) after permanent ligation of the right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> were seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the SHR but only in 6 out of 14 WKY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six hours after ligation, extravasated proteins were located primarily within the borders of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> whereas after 24 h and later there was an increasing spread in the white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 7 days, a protein immunoreactivity was seen far outside the infarcted areas, mainly in the white matter and occasionally extending somewhat into the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three weeks after permanent ligation, the immunoreactivity for plasma proteins had a similar extension but was less intense than after 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> was noted within the protein-positive regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From 72 h and onwards the immunoreactivity for albumin but not for fibrinogen extended via the white matter into the ipsilateral thalamic nuclei, where marked, mainly cytolytic nerve cell damage and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The close spatial correlation with albumin immunopositivity and the histological features of the thalamic lesions indicate that the propagation of extravasated plasma constituents or degradation products from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> may influence the character, timing and extent of remote tissue changes after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
