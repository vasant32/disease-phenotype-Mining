<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate and compare the association of soluble <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules and C-reactive protein levels with the prevalence of SBI in patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recruited 130 patients (mean age 59.6 +/- 7.6 yrs) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 130 age- and sex-matched non-diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects underwent head MRI to determine SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We measured levels of soluble intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1(sICAM-1), vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1(sVCAM-1), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and evaluated intima-media complex thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) in common carotid arteries by ultrasound B-mode imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SBI was present in 36 (27.7%) of the diabetic patients and 31 ( 23.8%) of the non-diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Levels of sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly higher in diabetic patients than in non-diabetic subjects, and were significantly increased in both subjects with SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was only positively correlated with sVCAM-1 levels in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, hs-CRP levels were not significantly different in both subjects with and without SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, sICAM-1 levels were associated with a significantly higher relative risk for the prevalence of SBI in diabetic patients after multivariate adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that the associations between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> and presence of SBI may be stronger in diabetic patients than in nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In particular, sICAM-1 may play an important role for the pathogenesis of SBI in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
