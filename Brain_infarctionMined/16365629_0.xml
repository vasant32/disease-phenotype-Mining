<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Intracranial vertebral artery dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are a recognized cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and the hemorrhagic recurrence risk after a first rupture of the dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is high and of poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, when the dissection is discovered in a patient with vertebrobasilar territory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, little is known about the risk of hemorrhagic rupture risk and there is no consensus on management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBSERVATION: We report the case of a 49-year-old man who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> 48 hours after the occurrence of a latero-bulbar syndrome caused by a spontaneous dissection with occlusion of the right vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subsequent angiography showed a V4 dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the right vertebral artery which was treated by stenting and coiling without any complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case underlines the hemorrhagic risk of an intradural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> and its possible progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequent angiographic imaging must be carefully examined to search for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> which may require early specific treatment because of the high risk of recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
