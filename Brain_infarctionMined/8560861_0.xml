<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Investigations were performed in 151 patients with ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> in order to determine the occurrence of anticardiolipin antibodies and define the clinical characteristics of patients with an increased titer of anticardiolipin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Measurement of anticardiolipin antibody titer was performed by immunoenzyme method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Besides, analyses of certain tests indicative for blood coagulative properties were also done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the occurrence of anticardiolipin antibodies was investigated in 49 patients with other non-immune <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> and disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control sera were obtained from 50 healthy subjects and 6 patients with senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Investigation showed the increase of anticardiolipin antibody titer in 22.8% of the patients with ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> (30% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, 19% with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>) and in 4% of the patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> of non-immunological genesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients with increased titer of anticardiolipin antibodies suffered more frequently from recurrent forms of ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them were below 50, and they had less risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that the presence of increased titer of anticardiolipin antibodies in younger patients with recurrent forms of ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> and less risk factors could be the marker of the increased risk for ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
