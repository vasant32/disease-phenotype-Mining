<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frontal, occipital and hippocampal regions were dissected out from these patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals shortly after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Positive Fas neurons were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these regions of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and Alzheimer patients, but not in the brains of patients with multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Activated caspase 8 protein was found only in the brains of Alzheimer patients and not in the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plaques in the Alzheimer patients were positive for Fas and activated caspase 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The former was localized in the membrane and the inside of the plaque whereas activated caspase 8 was only present in the interior of the plaque, as revealed by confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study shows that caspase 8 was activated in the Alzheimer brain and the presence of Fas and activated caspase 8 points to a possibility that at least some plaques were of intracellular origin as Fas was a cell membrane receptor and caspase 8 was a intracellular enzyme downstream to Fas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we had confirmed that in most neurons Fas and caspase 8 did not exist concomitantly and that the glial cells (astrocytes) did not express caspase 8 in Alzheimer patients </plain></SENT>
