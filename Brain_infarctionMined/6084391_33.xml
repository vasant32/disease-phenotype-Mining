<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored the utility of this technique in detecting experimental brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and report our findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> were produced in cats, gerbils, and rats by unilateral temporal and permanent cerebral vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After various time periods the animals were killed, and their brains were reacted with 2,3,5, triphenyl, 2H-tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The experimental and contralateral hemispheres were examined by light and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The TTC-stained tissue was correlated with histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In some situations the histological condition of the tissue correlated well with the TTC staining results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain regions supplied by temporarily occluded vessels and judged infarcted by light and electron microscopy did not stain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In these regions less than 6% of the mitochondria were intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In brain tissue from animals with permanent vessel occlusion (no reflow) mitochondria were intact despite the fact that other cellular organelles, such as nuclei, were destroyed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TTC stained such mitochondria and as a result could not distinguish infarcted brain in complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> situations (no reflow) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Another draw back to this staining procedure was 36 h after infarction macrophages with intact mitochondria would replace damage neurons and be stained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Under ideal conditions though this technique can detect irreversibly damaged brain as early as 2.5 h after <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
