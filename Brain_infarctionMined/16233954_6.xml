<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous evidence has shown that relaxin pretreatment reduces cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in anesthetized, male rats receiving permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the current study was designed to determine if estrogenic mechanisms or nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> production are involved in mediating this relaxin-induced neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In separate groups of rats (n=4-6), the following drugs were injected directly into the cortex 30 min prior to MCAO: (a) relaxin, (b) relaxin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>, and (c) relaxin and an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (ICI 182,780) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate the involvement of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>, relaxin or relaxin and an inhibitor of endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (L-NIO) were injected i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>30 min prior to MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Saline-treated rats (both intracortical (i.c.) and intravenously (i.v.)) served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brains were harvested 4h post <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, coronally sectioned using a brain matrix and stained using 2,3,5-triphenoltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Digital photographs were taken of brain sections and the ratio comparing the area of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> to the area of the ipsilateral hemisphere was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean ratios were compared using ANOVA and Tukey's test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intracortical and intravenous relaxin pretreatment significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area in the cortex by 33.7 and 58.6%, respectively compared to saline-treated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This effect was not dependent on an interaction with estrogenic receptors as co-injection of relaxin and ICI 182,780 did not reverse this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, inhibition of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase significantly reduced the relaxin-mediated neuroprotection suggesting that relaxin may induce the endothelin-NOS cascade in cerebral vasculature causing vasodilation and improved perfusion of neural tissue </plain></SENT>
