<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A national survey on health status and health behavior of the adult population included 15,379 Slovene inhabitants, aged 25 to 64 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate to a mailed questionnaire was almost 64%, and 9,043 questionnaires were eligible for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prevalence rates per 100 population (smoking, nutrition, alcohol intake, physical activity, stress) were determined, chi-square test was used for global assessment of interregional differences, and logistic regression for adjusting them for sex and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Interregional differences in prevalence were observed in very unhealthy nutrition related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (west: 34.0, center: 30.6, east: 41.8; p&lt;0.001), very unhealthy nutrition related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (west: 25.5, center: 29.4, east: 28.4; p=0.011), very unhealthy nutrition related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>-based diseases (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo>, myocardial and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, etc.) (west: 33.1, center: 31.8, east: 44.1; p&lt;0.001), heavy alcohol drinking (west: 11.2, center: 12.0, east: 15.2; p&lt;0.001), and physical inactivity (west: 18.0, center: 21.0, east: 15.3; p&lt;0.001), but not in smoking (west: 22.4, center: 24.5, east: 23.9; p=0.230) or stress (west: 23.2, center: 24.4, east: 24.7; p=0.388) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We confirmed significant interregional differences in the prevalence of most observed behavioral risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In behaviors with statistically significant interregional differences, the highest prevalence was confirmed for eastern Slovenia </plain></SENT>
