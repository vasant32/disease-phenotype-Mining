<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we sought to identify whether LA, independent of advancing age, affects outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: LA volume was quantified in 240 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and MRI within 24 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We explored the relationship between LA volume at admission and clinical outcome at 6 months, as assessed by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An ordinal logistic regression model was developed to analyze the independent effect of LA volume on clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bivariate analyses showed a significant correlation between LA volume and mRS at 6 months (r = 0.19, p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean mRS was 1.7 +/- 1.8 among those in the lowest (&lt; or =1.2 mL) and 2.5 +/- 1.9 in the highest (&gt;9.9 mL) quartiles of LA volume (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The unfavorable prognostic effect of LA volume on clinical outcome was retained in the multivariable model (p = 0.002), which included age, gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>), previous history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, admission plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, admission NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score, IV rtPA treatment, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume on MRI as covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The volume of leukoaraiosis is a predictor of clinical outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and this relationship persists after adjustment for important prognostic factors including age, initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
