<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The spatiotemporal electroencephalogram (EEG) pathology associated with brain injury was studied using high-resolution, 10-electrode cortical EEG mapping in a rat model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using this model we evaluated the ability of the novel <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel blocker and neuroprotective agent RS100642 to resolve injury-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>EEG abnormalities</z:hpo> as a measure of neurophysiological recovery from brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was occluded for 1 h during which a dramatic loss of EEG power was measured over the injured cortex with near complete recovery upon reperfusion of blood to the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> region in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The resultant progression of the MCAo/reperfusion injury (6-72 h) included the appearance of diffuse polymorphic delta activity (<z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp>), as visually indicated by the presence of high-amplitude slow-waves recorded from both brain hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp> was associated with large increases in EEG power, particularly evident in outer 'peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>' regions of the ipsilateral parietal cortex as visualized using topographic EEG mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Post-injury treatment with RS100642 (1.0 mg/kg, i.v.) significantly reduced the <z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp> activity and attenuated the increase in EEG power throughout the course of the injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These effects were associated with a reduction in brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improved neurological function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These methods of EEG analysis may be helpful tools to evaluate the physiological recovery of the brain from injury in humans following treatment with an experimental neuroprotective compound </plain></SENT>
