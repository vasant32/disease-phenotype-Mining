<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The benefits of surgical correction of moderate internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> have been demonstrated only in symptomatic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is debatable whether patients with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> ipsilateral to a moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> may be considered symptomatic like those with large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to seek markers capable of differentiating patients with lacunar or non-lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> ipsilateral to a moderate internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We enrolled 95 patients with a first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> ipsilateral to a moderate (50-69 %) stenosis of the internal carotid artery and divided them into lacunar and non-lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> based on clinical presentation and neuroradiological findings; 34 subjects with asymptomatic moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and 31 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline characteristics; risk factors, cerebrovascular reactivity to <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> evaluated by means of the breath-holding index (BHI), the presence and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and intimamedia thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) of the common carotid arteries were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 36 patients with lacunar and 59 with non-lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Degree of stenosis, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and BHI ipsilateral to symptomatic stenosis were found to be significant independent predictors as each 10 % increase of stenosis carried a 4.3 higher probability of non-lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (95 % CI: 1.91-9.51); each decimillimeter increment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> increased this probability by 1.45 (95 % CI: 1.10-1.92); and the risk odds ratio associated with each 0.1 increase in BHI was 1.88 (95 % CI: 1.33-2.66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A decrease in BHI of 0.1 thus carried a 90% greater probability of having a lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results show that patients with moderate internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> can be differentiated from those with non-lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on the basis of distinctive ultrasonographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to clarify whether our findings have pathogenetic implications and may be of help for the planning of different therapeutic strategies in patients with moderate internal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and lacunar or non-lacunar ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
