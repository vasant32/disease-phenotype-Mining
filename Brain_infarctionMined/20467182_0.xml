<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the first attack, the responsible lesion was unclear on MRI including DWI, but demonstrated a high uptake of (99m)Tc-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> SPECT during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase; thereafter the lesion became atrophic with a low uptake on SPECT during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the second attack, the responsible lesion revealed weakly hyperintense changes on DWI without marked changes on conventional modalities, but had a high uptake on SPECT and capillary blush on angiography during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that incomplete infarction can solely result in a massive and clinically critical lesion without an accompanying complete infarction </plain></SENT>
