<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Protocols were drafted by residents and staff members, criticised in protocol meetings and amended if necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During 6 months it was ascertained in each newly admitted patient (n = 317), whether a protocol was available, whether it was used and if not, why not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the period before the introduction of the protocol for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (the largest category), protocols were available for 20% of the patients and used in 61% of those patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After introduction of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> protocol, these percentages rose to 46 and 82, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Protocols were not used if doctors were not aware of them or forgot to use them or if they were not applicable to individual patients </plain></SENT>
