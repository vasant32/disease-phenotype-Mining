<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This pilot study assessed the possible neuroprotective action of high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> administration during the first week after an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, to obtain data for planning a wider multicenter study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, aged 75.3 (SD, ±11.9) years (68% women), were randomized into a placebo (n = 31) and an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> 80 mg/d (n = 31) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The double-blind treatment lasted 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was a decrease of National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score of 4 points or higher after 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume measured on computed tomographic scan after 3 days and a modified Rankin Scale of less than 2 at 3 months were secondary end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no difference in the primary end point between the 2 groups (odds ratio, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> vs placebo, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-2.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume also was similar in the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Instead, there were more patients with modified Rankin Scale of less than 2 at 3 months in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> than in the placebo group (adjusted odds ratio, 6.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-45.0; P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This prevalence concerned only the subgroup with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale, ≤10; 53.8% vs 15.4%, respectively; P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">Atorvastatin</z:chebi> was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study was unable to show any short-term benefit of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, it suggested a possible favorable functional effect at 3 months in the least severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, which could be the primary end point for a future multicenter trial </plain></SENT>
