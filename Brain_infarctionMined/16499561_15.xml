<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein, we examined whether <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> would reduce postischemic increase in the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) permeability and, therefore, attenuate the risk of hemorrhagic transformation after t-PA therapy in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve mice were subjected to transient occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> for 1 hr, followed by 24 hr of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">Melatonin</z:chebi> (5 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle was given at the beginning of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability was evaluated by quantitation of Evans Blue leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An additional 32 mice underwent photothrombotic occlusion of the distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, and were administered vehicle or t-PA (10 mg/kg, i.v.), alone or in combination with <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> (5 mg/kg, i.p.), at 6 hr postinsult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The animals were then killed after 24 hr for the determination of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relative to controls, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>-treated animals had significantly reduced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability (by 52%; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we found that at 6 hr after photo-irradiation, either t-PA or <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>, or a combined administration of t-PA plus <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>, did not significantly affect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (P &gt; 0.05), compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mice treated with t-PA alone, however, had significantly increased hemorrhagic formation (P &lt; 0.05), and the event was effectively reversed by co-treatment with <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> improved postischemic preservation of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability and a decreased risk of adverse hemorrhagic transformation after t-PA therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The findings further highlight <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>'s potential role in the field of thrombolytic treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
