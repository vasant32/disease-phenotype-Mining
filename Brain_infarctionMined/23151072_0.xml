<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies over the past years have provided interesting insights into the molecular mechanisms of this neuroprotective phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this research, we attempted to see changes in the expression of group I and II metabotropic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptors (mGluR I and II) following intermittent <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp> preconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were divided into five groups (<z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp>-intact, <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp>-MCAO, room air-intact, room air- MCAO, room air-sham) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>Hyperoxia</z:mp> groups were exposed to 95% inspired O2 for 4 h/day and 6 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Oxygen level in room air groups was %21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>48 hours after pretreatment, MCAO-operated groups were subjected to focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> for 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>24 hours after reperfusion, neurologic deficit score (NDS) and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (IV) were evaluated in MCAO-operated subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sham-operated and intact groups were used to assess expression of group I and II mGluR and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) levels of core, penumbra and subcortex regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of this study showed that preconditioning with intermittent HO decreased NDS and IV, increased GSH levels in subcortex, and upregulated mGluRs I and II significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although additional studies will be required to further elucidate precise mechanism(s) of ischemic tolerance, it seems that intermittent HO may exert its protective effects in part through upregulation of mGluR I and II </plain></SENT>
