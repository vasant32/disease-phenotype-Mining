<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the predictive value of the ischemic lesion size, as depicted in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> phase on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) images and time-to-peak (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) maps of tissue perfusion imaging, for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, as derived from T2-weighted imaging in the postacute phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty patients who underwent diffusion-weighted and perfusion imaging within 1-24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and a follow-up T2-weighted investigation after about 8 days were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lesion volumes were evaluated by using a semiautomatic thresholding technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Volumetric results of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> diffusion-weighted and perfusion imaging were analyzed in comparison with follow-up T2-weighted images and in terms of the time difference between symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At diffusion-weighted imaging, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lesion defined by a signal intensity increase of more than 20%, compared with the contralateral side, showed the best correlation with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size after 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At perfusion imaging, the best predictor relative to the contralateral side was a delay of more than 6 seconds on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Temporal analysis of volumetric results, which depended on the time difference between symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and examination, revealed two patient subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Diffusion-weighted imaging helped to predict the size of the lesion on T2-weighted images obtained after about 8 days in patients with a symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of more than 4 hours (r = 0.96), while in patients with a symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of less than 4 hours, perfusion imaging provided important additional information about brain tissue with impaired perfusion </plain></SENT>
