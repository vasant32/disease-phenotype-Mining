<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 48 patients, 28 men and 21 women, mean age 68.1 (range 54-75), observed within 5 h of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the middle cerebral artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound evaluation (duplex scanner and transcranial doppler) and cerebral angiography were carried out in close sequence immediately after CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT was repeated by Day 7 to estimate the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size: 27/48 patients had intracranial arterial obstructions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An acoustic temporal "window" was not found in 6.25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transcranial doppler showed a sensitivity of 80.0% and a specificity of 90.0% compared with cerebral Angiography for patients with patent acoustic temporal "windows" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Accuracy was 79.2%, when patients with no "windows" were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With respect to intracranial internal carotid artery and middle cerebral artery mainstem, transcranial doppler showed a sensitivity of 95.0%, and a specificity of 92.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Including patients with no windows, accuracy was 87.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Our data suggest that Transcranial Doppler can be reliably used to demonstrate intracranial internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery mainstem obstructions in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
