<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We produced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> with cavitation in five rats by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After in vivo MRI, histologic sections of the MRI plane were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured the signal intensity of regions on FLAIR and spin-echo images, and measured the area of cavitation on histologic sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We plotted curves of cavity percentage to signal intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Theoretical values were calculated using a two-compartment model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the curve of cavity area to signal intensity, the signal on FLAIR images peaked in tissues with 20% to 30% area of cavitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the theoretical curve, the signal on FLAIR images peaked at 90% tissue water content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results seem to be characteristic of FLAIR </plain></SENT>
