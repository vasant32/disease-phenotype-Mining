<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A series comprising 12 patients who had intraarterial local fibrinolysis in the carotid territory is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A classification is proposed that divides the different types of occlusions into three groups on the basis of angiographic location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group 1 (two cases) comprises occlusion of the extra- and/or intracranial carotid artery with patency of the circle of Willis and the lenticulostriate arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this group, there is no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, the CT findings are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and the clinical signs are mainly hemodynamic and intermittent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fibrinolysis may be performed late and rather safely and completed by surgery or angioplasty of the neck vessel stenosis responsible for the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group 2 (five cases) comprises occlusions of the cortical arteries without involvement of the lenticulostriate arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of the occlusion can be hemodynamic or embolic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group 3 (five cases) comprises occlusions of intracerebral arteries involving the lenticulostriate arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In groups 2 and 3 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, fibrinolysis will only be able to restore viability of the area of cerebral tissue surrounding the infarction (penumbra) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The time factor is particularly critical in group 3 because lenticulostriate arteries are terminal vessels whose revascularization may induce <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> with increasing frequency as the occlusion time is prolonged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The time factor is less critical in group 2 because collaterals make the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> less severe in the infarcted area and the vital and functional consequences of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> are not as serious as in group 3 because of the location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this series, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the symptomatic complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (two cases) occurred in group 3, in patients treated later than 6 hr after clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Given the time delay inherent in performing CT and angiography and in making the medical decision, it is considered dangerous to undertake fibrinolytic therapy in group 3, unless it can be started before 4 or 5 hr after clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
