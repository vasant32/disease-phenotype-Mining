<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its non-anti-oxidant, intracellular molecular mechanism remains elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For in vivo experiments in rats, orally administered vitamin E significantly reduced not only the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume but also space navigation disability after permanent middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The level of anti-oxidant after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion was significantly increased specifically in the ipsilateral brain tissues of vitamin E-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For in vitro experiments, posttreatment with vitamin E protected primary cultured neurons from nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>-induced insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vitamin E induced the expression of the alpha subunit of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and its target genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> response element on the VEGF promoter was responsible for this vitamin E-induced transcriptional activation of VEGF gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> increased the permeability of vitamin E across the blood-brain barrier, and this increased vitamin E in brain tissue elicited neuroprotective effects not only through scavenging oxidants, as are previously well reported, but also by transactivating HIF-1-dependent genes, which results in protection of brains from ischemic insults </plain></SENT>
