<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies show that intravascular injection of human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) significantly improves neurological functional recovery in a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> improves the efficiency of intraarterial MSC delivery (i.e., fewer injected cells required for therapeutic efficacy) after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were four post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> groups (N=9): group 1, negative control with only intraarterial injection of 1 million human fibroblasts in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); group 2, intravenous injection of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> alone in PBS (1.5 g/kg); group 3, intraarterial injection of 1 million hBMSCs alone in PBS; and group 4, intravenous injection of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> (1.5 g/kg) in PBS followed by intraarterial injection of 1 million hBMSCs in PBS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group 4 exhibited significantly improved neurological functional outcome as assessed by neurological severity score (NSS) and corner test scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining of group 4 suggested increased synaptogenesis, proliferating immature neurons, and neuronal migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of hBMSCs recruited to the injured region increased strikingly in group 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tissue loss was notably reduced in group 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, the beneficial effects of intraarterial infusion of MSCs are amplified with intravenous injection of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preadministration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> significantly increases the number of hBMSCs located in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> region, improves histochemical parameters of neural regeneration, and reduces the anatomical and pathological consequences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
