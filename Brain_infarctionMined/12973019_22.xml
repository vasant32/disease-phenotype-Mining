<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> that exacerbates cerebral injury after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is an attractive therapeutic target: it progresses over days and strongly contributes to worsening of the neurologic outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors show that, after transient ischemic injury to the rat brain, systemic application of interferon-beta (IFN-beta), a cytokine with antiinflammatory properties, attenuated the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that IFN-beta treatment reduced lesion volume on diffusion-weighted MRI by 70% (P &lt; 0.01) at 1 day after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IFN-beta attenuated the leakage of contrast agent through the blood-brain barrier (P &lt; 0.005), indicating a better-preserved blood-brain barrier integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both control and IFN-beta-treated animals showed a similar degree of relative hyperperfusion of the lesioned hemisphere, indicating that neuroprotection by IFN-beta was not mediated by improved cerebral perfusion as assessed 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IFN-beta treatment resulted in an 85% reduction (P &lt; 0.0001) in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume 3 weeks later, as determined from T2-weighted MRI and confirmed by histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect was achieved even when treatment was started 6 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Quantitative immunohistochemistry at 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> showed that IFN-beta almost completely prevented the infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes into the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Gelatinase zymography showed that this effect was associated with a decrease in matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, treatment with the antiinflammatory cytokine IFN-beta affords significant neuroprotection against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury, and within a relatively long treatment window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because IFN-beta has been approved for clinical use, it may be rapidly tested in a clinical trial for its efficacy against human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
