<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case-controlled study was conducted with 131 cases of CI and 148 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma fibrinogen levels were detected by the Clauss method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High fibrinogen level (3.09 +/- 0.94 g/L) was correlated with CI (OR = 2.47, 95% CI: 1.51-4.04, P &lt; 0.005) at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Persistent high fibrinogen level (3.14 +/- 0.81 g/L) at 6-month after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was detected and correlated with CI (OR = 4.34, 95% CI: 1.80-10.51, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Higher fibrinogen level was correlated with total anterior circulation infarction (TACI), partial anterior circulation infarction (PACI), and posterior circulation infarction (POCI) (OR = 4.008, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher fibrinogen level was correlated with extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (OR = 3.220, P &lt; 0.05, but not with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Fibrinogen level may be a risk factor of CI and probably correlates with subtypes of CI and distributions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
