<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Focal cortical injuries result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of cortical neurons and their efferents and ultimately in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or damage of thalamocortical relay (TCR) neurons that project to the affected cortical area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurons of the inhibitory reticular thalamic nucleus (nRT) receive excitatory inputs from corticothalamic and thalamocortical axons and are thus denervated by such injuries, yet nRT cells generally survive these insults to a greater degree than TCR cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>nRT cells inhibit TCR cells, regulate thalamocortical transmission, and generate cerebral rhythms including those involved in thalamocortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The survival and reorganization of nRT after cortical injury would determine recovery of thalamocortical circuits after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the physiological properties and connectivity of the survivors remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To study possible alterations in nRT neurons, we used the rat photothrombosis model of cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using in vitro patch-clamp recordings at various times after the photothrombotic injury, we show that localized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in the somatosensory cortex induce long-term reductions in intrinsic excitability and evoked synaptic excitation of nRT cells by the end of the first week after the injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We find that nRT neurons in injured rats show (1) decreased membrane input resistance, (2) reduced low-threshold calcium burst responses, and (3) weaker evoked excitatory synaptic responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such alterations in nRT cellular excitability could lead to loss of nRT-mediated inhibition in relay nuclei, increased output of surviving TCR cells, and enhanced thalamocortical excitation, which may facilitate recovery of thalamic and cortical sensory circuits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, such changes could be maladaptive, leading to injury-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
