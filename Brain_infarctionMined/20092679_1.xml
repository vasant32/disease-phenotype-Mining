<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aims to determine if cerebral blood flow is constituently higher during the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or reperfusion events in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned into exercise or non-exercise (control) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exercised rats underwent 30 minutes of running on a treadmill for 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 2 hour unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> using an intraluminal filament was performed to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, followed by a 24 hour reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A sham control without exercise and middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) and (15)O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) were used to determine cerebral blood flow, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(18)F-fluorodeoxy-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4167">D-glucose</z:chebi> was used to determine cerebral metabolism in some animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histological analysis determined <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the same animal after blood flow examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LDF and PET both indicated that middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> significantly (p&lt;0.05) reduced cerebral blood flow during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion in association with reduced cerebral metabolism after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, pre-ischemic exercise significantly (p&lt;0.05) improved cerebral blood flow during reperfusion, although cerebral blood flow remained at a similar level to that of the non-exercise <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group during the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This improved cerebral blood flow during reperfusion was associated with decreased brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that pre-ischemic exercise in rats improved cerebral blood flow during reperfusion, suggesting that exercise provides neuroprotection by partially ameliorating the 'no reflow' phenomenon in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
