<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Results from case-control and case-case studies indicate that a positive family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (FHstroke) is an independent risk factor for lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> phenotypes can be distinguished on the basis of the presence of asymptomatic lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (aLACs), ischemic white-matter lesions, or brain microbleeds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine whether familial aggregation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was different for lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 157 patients with a first-ever lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, a complete first-degree FHstroke was obtained by a standardized questionnaire and additional interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were categorized successively into groups, depending on the presence of aLACs, ischemic white-matter lesions, and brain microbleeds on magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-two percent of patients reported a positive FHstroke in at least one of their first-degree relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In younger (&lt;65 years) probands, a high frequency of parental FHstroke (59% versus 20%, P&lt;0.01) in those with aLACs compared with probands without aLACs was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, the strongest associations were found for parental FHstroke (odds ratio=6.46; 95% CI=1.96 to 21.33), maternal FHstroke (odds ratio=4.00; 95% CI=1.18 to 13.56), and paternal FHstroke (odds ratio=5.40; 95% CI=1.14 to 25.61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> might be an independent risk factor for the lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> phenotype with aLACs at younger ages, suggesting a role for genetic factors in this phenotype caused by diffuse vasculopathy </plain></SENT>
