<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We wanted to establish independent associations of various clinical variables, computed tomographic (CT) scan features, presenting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes, and outcome with the presence of silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 755 consecutive patients in a prospective registration of patients with first-ever supratentorial atherothrombotic, cardioembolic, or lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of undetermined cause by multiple logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred six patients (27%) with a first symptomatic territorial or small deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> had one or more silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> silent lesions, 169 (82%) were small and deep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were significantly more strongly associated with a lacunar than atherothrombotic (odds ratio [OR], 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 2.47; P = .039) or cardioembolic (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.99; P = .005) index <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Silent territorial lesions were more strongly associated with cardioembolic than with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> but not with atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this respect, no differences were found between the atherothrombotic and undetermined-cause group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Advanced age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were the only risk factors that were significantly associated with silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.14 to 2.71; P = .011; and OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.13 to 2.21; P = .007; respectively), mainly because of a strong independent association of these risk factors with silent small deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.79; P = .018; and OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.09 to 2.24; P = .014; respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A cardioembolic source or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in specific was not independently associated with any type or number of silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (diameter reduction &gt; 50%) was not significantly associated with any type of silent lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Initial severe handicap (Rankin Scale score &gt; 3), 30-day case fatality rate, and 1-year mortality were not affected by the presence of silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The strong association of silent small deep lesions with first symptomatic small deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> suggests a common underlying mechanism (presumably small-vessel vasculopathy), whereas cardiogenic embolism and large-vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> are the most likely causes in both silent and first symptomatic territorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Single or multiple silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> do not predict a cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism in first symptomatic supratentorial brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>As silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> do not predict the cause of carotid embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in first symptomatic brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, their presence should not influence the decision on carotid surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> do not affect the degree of initial handicap, 30-day case fatality, or 1-year mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The significance of silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> for predicting possible future <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> deserves further study </plain></SENT>
