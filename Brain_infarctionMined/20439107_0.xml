<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively collected demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from 188 Chinese hypertensive patients (111 with SCI, 77 with non-SCI) and analyzed nocturnal BP variation in the SCI and non-SCI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression was used for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that both single and multiple SCI were more common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695689" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nondipping</z:e> patients than dipping patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In further analysis comparing the SCI group with the non-SCI group, we found that carotid artery plaques and duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were independent risk factors of SCI (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The nocturnal BP fall (r=-10.614, p=0.000) was also found to be negatively correlated with SCI in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695689" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nondipping</z:e> was not different between the users of three different classes of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our ambulatory blood pressure monitoring study suggested that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695689" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nondipping</z:e> was associated with both single and multiple SCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Abnormal circadian blood pressure rhythm, a parameter in evaluating injury of brain blood vessels, might be a risk factor of SCI </plain></SENT>
