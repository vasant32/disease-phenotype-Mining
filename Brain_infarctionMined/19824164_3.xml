<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined general cognition in 30 nonaphasic first-ever lacunar syndrome participants, using a battery of standard clinical neuropsychological measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At a group level, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> participants did not demonstrate any <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> relative to well-matched community-based controls up to 12 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was also no evidence of increased frequencies of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> after a single clinical lacunar syndrome relative to matched control participants within the first year post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that a clinically diagnosed first ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> event, presenting as a lacunar syndrome, was not associated with an elevated risk of developing mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> 12 months post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
