<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The autopsy material is considered to be representative for the population in Oslo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The area stenosis was determined morphometrically in histological sections and the cases were examined for the occurrence of atherosclerotic plaques, calcifications, plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp>, ulcerations, and mural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>About one half of the cases had more than 50% stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was increasing frequency of plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp>, ulcerations and mural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> with increasing stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the stenosis exceeded 60%, most cases had small recent and old plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> and one half had ulcerations and mural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, numerous healed ulcerations and organized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that plaque complications are frequent in cases with stenosis and that most of them apparently heal without giving rise to symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of such lesions in asymptomatic cases must therefore be interpreted with caution </plain></SENT>
