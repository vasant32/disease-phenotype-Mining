<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) is increasingly used to assess adequate occlusion after embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (ES) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Employing LDF, relative regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was continuously monitored during the first 2 h following ES and correlated with 24 h 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC)-staining of corrected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a preliminary experiment (n=18), it was demonstrated that rCBF-reduction to 37% or less of baseline correctly identified occlusion success in the suture middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (sMCAO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the same methodology, we then assessed whether LDF allowed for identification of animals with successful ES (experiment 2, n=26) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-mediated reperfusion following ES (experiment 3, n=28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In ES rats, 3 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patterns were identified: small (&lt;150 mm(3)), medium ( approximately 250 mm(3)), and large (&gt;400 mm(3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats with an rCBF below 45% of preocclusion values had an 80% probability of developing medium to large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, whereas rats with an rCBF above the 45%-threshold had a 100% chance of developing small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LDF did not reliably detect reperfusion in tPA-treated animals (sensitivity=40%), because it apparently occurred within brain areas remote from the LDF-monitoring site as indicated by TTC-staining and magnetic resonance angiography in a subset of animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: LDF is an excellent screening method to identify animals with successful ES; however, distinction of medium from large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> is not possible, the critical threshold for identifying adequate occlusion is higher than in the sMCAO model, and LDF poorly predicts tPA-mediated reperfusion </plain></SENT>
