<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in functional imaging of human brain activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging, have revealed that cortical hemisphere contralateral to the infarction plays an important role in the recovery process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, underlying mechanisms occurring in contralateral hemisphere during functional recovery have not been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We experimentally induced a complete infarction of somatosensory cortex in right hemisphere of mice and examined the neuronal changes in contralateral (left) somatosensory cortex during recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both basal and ipsilateral somatosensory stimuli-evoked neuronal activity in left (intact) hemisphere transiently increased 2 d after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, followed by an increase in the turnover rate of usually stable mushroom-type synaptic spines at 1 week, observed by using two-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> imaging in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 4 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, when functional recovery had occurred, a new pattern of electrical circuit activity in response to somatosensory stimuli was established in intact ipsilateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the left somatosensory cortex can compensate for the loss of the right somatosensory cortex by remodeling neuronal circuits and establishing new sensory processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding could contribute to establish the effective clinical treatments targeted on the intact hemisphere for the recovery of impaired functions and to achieve better quality of life of patients </plain></SENT>
