<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several clinical scales have been developed for predicting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These clinical scores could be extremely useful to guide triage decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to compare the very early predictive accuracy of the most relevant clinical scores [age, blood pressure, clinical features and duration of symptoms (ABCD) score, ABCD and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (ABCD2) score, ABCD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> on imaging score, ABCD2 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> on imaging score, ABCD and prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> within 1 week of the index event (ABCD3) score, California Risk Score, Essen <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Risk Score and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Prognosis Instrument II] in consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between April 2008 and December 2009, we included 1,255 consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients from 30 Spanish <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> centers (PROMAPA study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A neurologist treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients within the first 48 h after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The duration and typology of clinical symptoms, vascular risk factors and etiological work-ups were prospectively recorded in a case report form in order to calculate established prognostic scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We determined the early short-term risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (at 7 and 90 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the performance of each model, we calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards multivariate analyses determining independent predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence using the different components of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinical scores were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We calculated clinical scales for 1,137 patients (90.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven-day and 90-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risks were 2.6 and 3.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (LAA) was observed in 190 patients (16.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We could confirm the predictive value of the ABCD3 score for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence at the 7-day follow-up [0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-0.77] and 90-day follow-up (0.61, 95% CI 0.52-0.70), which improved when we added vascular imaging information and derived ABCD3V scores by assigning 2 points for at least 50% symptomatic stenosis on carotid or intracranial imaging (0.69, 95% CI 0.57-0.81, and 0.63, 95% CI 0.51-0.69, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>When we evaluated each component of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinical scores using Cox regression analyses, we observed that prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and LAA were independent predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence at the 7-day follow-up [hazard ratio (HR) 3.97, 95% CI 1.91-8.26, p &lt; 0.001, and HR 3.11, 95% CI 1.47-6.58, p = 0.003, respectively] and 90-day follow-up (HR 2.35, 95% CI 1.28-4.31, p = 0.006, and HR 2.20, 95% CI 1.15-4.21, p = 0.018, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> published scores that do not take into account vascular imaging or prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> when identifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> failed to predict risk when applied by neurologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Clinical scores were not able to replace extensive emergent diagnostic evaluations such as vascular imaging, and they should take into account unstable patients with recent prior transient episodes </plain></SENT>
