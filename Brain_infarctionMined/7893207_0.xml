<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Evaluate current practice in a university hospital on management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood-pressure</z:mp> in patients in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (BI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case report of a lucid patient admitted 8 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of a BI with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CT and <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> (BP = 186/110 mmHg) was presented to staff members and resident physicians (departments of neurology and neurosurgery excluded) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Responders were asked to decide as to the best therapeutic option: no treatment/reduction/elevation of BP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 27 of 44 responders (61%) considered BP reduction as the best treatment option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same trend was observed among residents (16/27: 60%) and staff members (11/17: 65%); among surgeons (6/12: 50%) and clinicians (20/30: 67%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BP reduction in the hyperacute phase of BI may be harmful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This basic concept of BI management has not been adequately assimilated by physicians of our university hospital, including those recently graduated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of this study signal to the urgent need of a wide diffusion of current concepts on pathophysiology and treatment of BI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Organization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> units may contribute to better patient management, medical education and research </plain></SENT>
