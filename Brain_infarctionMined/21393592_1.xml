<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cortical venous reflux (CVR) is a high risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behavior</z:hpo> of intracranial dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> (DAVF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathological conditions in brain tissue affected by CVR were investigated by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review identified 56 patients with DAVFs who underwent diffusion-weighted imaging before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients had neurological symptoms corresponding to the brain area affected by CVR (Group I), 21 patients with CVR had no focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain dysfunctions</z:e> (Group II), and 15 patients had no CVR (Group III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) was measured for 11 brain areas predefined based on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> venous drainage patterns in the 56 patients and in 21 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> ratio was calculated for each area by dividing the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> value of patients by that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Areas affected by CVR in Group I showed a mean <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>-to-control ratio of 0.72, which was significantly lower than that of Group II (0.96, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up studies demonstrated significantly increased <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> ratios in brain areas affected by CVR after the DAVFs were treated successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> ratio of an affected area remained low, with persistent symptoms in 1 patient who underwent palliative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Decreased <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> was observed in the brain parenchyma affected by CVR and was associated with regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Successful treatment of the DAVF increased the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> toward <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> may be a useful indicator of the severity of CVR </plain></SENT>
