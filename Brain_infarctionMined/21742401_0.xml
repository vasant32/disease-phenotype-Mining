<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We conducted a 3-year longitudinal study concerning an association between cognitive function and cerebral small vessel disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>) seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in elderly type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four cognitive function tests--MMSE, word recall, Digit Symbol Substitution (DSS), and Stroop Color Word (Stroop)--were performed in 67 diabetic patients twice in 2006 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> was diagnosed as silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (SBI) and white matter lesions (WMLs) according to MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Number of SBI was significantly correlated with a decline in DSS and Stroop tests, while WMLs grade was only associated with it in DSS tests after adjustment for age, gender, education years, the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, and smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> at baseline was stronger associated with cognitive function after the 3-year follow-up than at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>WMLs progression was associated with more rapid decline of DSS tests compared to a group without progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> seen on MRI is a good marker for predicting future <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>, and monitoring of treatment through the use of such markers is expected to maintain a good quality of life for elderly diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
