<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The association between non-rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has been studied in 402 patients consecutively admitted to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain infarction</z:e> patients with sinus rhythm (n = 196) and non-rheumatic AF (n = 92) were further compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some findings supported an embolic origin of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>: half of the deceased AF patients (n = 24) at autopsy either had left <z:mp ids='MP_0001855'>atrial thrombosis</z:mp> or arterial embolism compared to none of the ten with sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with AF also had a higher mortality and more severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e>, findings compatible with a sudden occlusion of blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, these differences might also be explained by an atherothrombotic occlusion with impaired autoregulation in the ischaemic region in conjunction with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, which was more common in the AF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other findings supporting an atherothrombotic mechanism were: the prevalence of AF was higher (19-29%) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> kinds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, including haemorrhage, than in age-matched controls (3-9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also patients with previous AF and no present embolic source resembled the whole AF group and differed from patients with sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus embolism is a plausible cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in many AF patients, whereas an atherothrombotic origin is more likely in others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Characteristics identifying the mechanism in an individual case were not found </plain></SENT>
