<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Non-recognition of a critical aortic arch branch variation at surgery, with fatal consequences, prompted a retrospective analysis of the prevalence of aortic arch branch variations in the South African population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three hundred and twenty aortic arch angiograms were analysed from existing records (January 1988--March 1998) of the vascular unit, Department of Surgery, University of Natal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Aortic arch branch variations were observed in 17 cases (5.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These variations were as follows: (i) 11 cases with two primary branches (3.4%); (ii) 1 case with three primary branches (0.3%); and (iii) 5 cases with four primary branches (1.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The clinical presentations which these variations give rise to are well known and may present during the first days of life or later in adulthood, or remain clinically silent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Non-recognition of the latter situation in the presence of vascular trauma may have fatal consequences </plain></SENT>
