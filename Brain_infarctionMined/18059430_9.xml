<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cortical spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> is a pathophysiological excitation wave that occurs during pathophysiological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393420" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain conditions</z:e> such as ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> aura, and others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Judged from experiments in rodents, the brainstem is thought to be comparatively resistant to the generation of spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, because spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> can be elicited in the brainstem of rat pups after superfusing the brainstem with solutions enhancing excitability, we reinvestigated spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in the brainstem of the adult rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on theoretical predictions indicating a major role of extracellular <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> in susceptibility to spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, we used conditioning solutions in which <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> ions were replaced by <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44296">tetraethylammonium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> and a small amount of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> were added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Under these conditions, spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was reproducibly elicited in the brainstem either by topical application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> crystals to the brainstem surface or by local microinjection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> into the brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The direct current shifts so elicited were accompanied by typical elevation of extracellular <z:chebi fb="3" ids="29103">potassium ions</z:chebi>, propagated in the brainstem, and were prevented by MK-801, an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl D-aspartate</z:chebi> blocker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, the regional blood flow in the brainstem was transiently increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, systemic arterial blood pressure, but not the heart rate, was transiently enhanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the nonconditioned brainstem, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> stimulation neither elicited spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> nor induced changes in regional blood flow and blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data show that proper conditioning renders the brainstem susceptible to spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and that spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> at this site elicits changes in local circulation and systemic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
