<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to find out whether RH patients with (T+) or without (T-) thrombolytic treatment and healthy controls differ in their starting points in three cancellation tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our sample comprised of 77 patients and 62 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients received thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rightward orientation bias was more evident in the T-â€‰group than in the T+ group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The T+ group showed a robust tendency to start <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cancellation tasks more often on the right side than the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regardless of whether they had visual neglect, patients in the T+ group showed still defective rightward orienting, possibly indicating residual attentional problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The analyses of starting points in visual cancellation tasks provide additional information on residual symptoms of attention difficulties after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
