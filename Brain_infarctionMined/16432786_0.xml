<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this model, small burr holes were made over the anterior and posterior anastomotic veins and after precisely locating these vessels, bipolar coagulation and microscissors were used to perform permanent occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three days later, rats were sacrificed by perfusion and fixation and specimens were evaluated by histopathological techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Morphological changes of ependymal, subependymal and choroids plexus cells were evaluated in operated and intact hemispheres and revealed cell proliferation in the subventricular zone adjacent to the territory of venous occlusion in the operated hemisphere as well as midline shift, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedema</z:hpo>, subcortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031256" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">petechial haemorrhage</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and hemispheric swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, following anterior (the vein of Throlard) and posterior (the vein of Labb√©) anastomotic vein occlusion, cell proliferation can be seen in the choroids plexus, ependymal and subependymal regions in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that these morphological changes might be part of a self-repairing mechanism in the brain </plain></SENT>
