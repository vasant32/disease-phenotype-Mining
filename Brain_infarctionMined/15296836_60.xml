<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">Minocycline</z:chebi>, an antibiotic, has recently been shown to have neuroprotective effects distinct from its antimicrobial effect in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> including ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> on neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752304" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoxic-ischemic brain injury</z:e> by using histologic scoring in both mouse and rat models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mouse (C57Bl/6) and rat (SD) pups were exposed to a unilateral hypoxic-ischemic insult at 8 and 7 days of age, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50697">Minocycline hydrochloride</z:chebi> was administered according to protocols that were reported to provide neuroprotection in adult or neonatal rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven days after the insult, we examined brain injury in Nissl stained sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> ameliorated brain injury in the developing rat, it increased injury in the developing mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This detrimental effect in the mouse was consistent across different regions (cortex, striatum, and thalamus), with both single and multiple injection protocols and with both moderate and high-dose treatment (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of the contrasting effects in mouse and rat is not clear and remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">Minocycline</z:chebi> has been used as an antibiotic in the clinical setting for decades; therefore, it may be considered for use in infants with hypoxic-ischemic brain damage, based on prior reports of neuroprotection in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, it is important to examine this drug carefully before clinical use in human infants, taking our data in the mouse model into consideration </plain></SENT>
