<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We compared the usefulness of two methods for diagnosing asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>: an ultrasonic quantitative flow measurement system (QFM) and a transcranial Doppler arteriography (TCDA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 137 patients (73 men and 64 women) who underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, QFM, and TCDA were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their ages ranged from 41 to 83 years (mean age, 63 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into 3 groups: 45 without cerebrovascular disease (Group N); 40 with asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (Group AS); and 52 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (Group LI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean blood flow in the common carotid artery (CCA-BF) was measured by QFM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean blood velocity and Fourier pulsatility index in the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-BV, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-PI) were measured by TCDA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Group N, 28 patients were examined twice at a mean interval of 2 years; 19 remained without asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (Group N1), and asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> developed in the remaining 9 (Group N2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 3 groups differed significantly in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-PI (N &lt; AS &lt; LI), but not in CCA-BF or in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-BV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-PI in Group N2 was higher than that in Group N1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the Fourier pulsatility index determined by TCDA may be useful for detecting the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
