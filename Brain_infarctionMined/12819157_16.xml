<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To compare the accuracy of ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter abnormalities</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">preterm infants</z:e> and to determine the specific indications for MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A neonatal intensive care unit in France </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">preterm infants</z:e> (&lt;/= 33 weeks gestation) without severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> syndrome precluding MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: US and MRI performed contemporaneously during the third postnatal week were analysed by an independent observer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The findings were compared with those of a term MRI scan, the results of which were taken as the final diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed to determine which early imaging study best predicted the term MRI findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The early US and MRI findings (79 infants) correlated closely for severe lesions (cystic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023529" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periventricular leucomalacia</z:e> and parenchymal infarction; kappa coefficient = 0.86) but not for moderate lesions (non-cystic leucomalacia and parenchymal punctate haemorrhages; kappa = 0.62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, early MRI findings predicted late MRI findings in 98% of patients (95% confidence interval (CI) 89.5 to 99.9) compared with only 68% for early US (95% CI 52.1 to 79.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: US is highly effective in detecting severe lesions of the white matter in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">preterm infants</z:e>, but MRI seems to be necessary for the diagnosis of less severe damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MRI performed at about the third week of life is highly predictive of the final diagnosis at term </plain></SENT>
