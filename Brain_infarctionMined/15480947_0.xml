<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Patients admitted to our hospital for the purposes of rehabilitation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and had SLB prescription from October 2001 to October 2003 were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 20 patients (19 men, 11 women) were investigated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Average age was 60.8 +/- 8.60 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (12), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (7), and subarachnoid hemorrage (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> in 15 patients, and left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> in 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Activities of daily living (ADLs) were evaluated by FIM at admission and at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference between these FIM scores was recorded as DeltaFIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The levels of ambulation were classified into "need help," "need observation," and "self-sufficient." At the same time, the need for walking aid was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To determine the effects of SLB, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients were checked for period of ambulation with cane to the prescription of SLB (period A), period of completion of SLB to acquirement of final walking ability (period B), and Brunnstrom recovery stage for the evaluation of motor recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, the level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo>, the periods of A and B, ADL assessments, and final ambulation level were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the time of admisison, the average FIM was 73.9 +/- 24.2; average FIM at time of discharge was 98.2 +/- 21.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DeltaFIM was 24.3 +/- 21.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The period A was 37.9 +/- 22.7 days and the period B was 36.8 +/- 24.6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The final gait performance was need help, 6; need supervision, 11; and self-sufficient, 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>When we compared Brunnstrom recovery stage III and IV patients and Brunnstrom recovery stage II patients, stage II patients had a longer period A </plain></SENT>
