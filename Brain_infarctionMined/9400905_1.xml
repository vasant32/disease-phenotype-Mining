<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred milligrams of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2379">acebutolol</z:chebi> twice daily (n = 15) is effective in lowering the BP during the daytime, but has little effect during the night and the morning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty milligrams of slow-release <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> twice daily (n = 14) produced a consistent reduction in the BP over the entire 24-h period and effectively blunted the rise in BP in the morning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">Captopril</z:chebi> (12.5 mg) twice daily (n = 15) produced a mild reduction in BP with little change in the circadian pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The slow-release <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> group had the greatest decrease in mean systolic and diastolic BP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The heart rate significantly increased after administration of slow-release <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> and decreased after administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2379">acebutolol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
