<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is increasing evidence that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> during midlife may represent a predictor of subsequent mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> decades later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the exact mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unknown since plasmatic cholesterol is not able to cross the blood-brain barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we evaluated the hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> triggered by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> during aging may be related to brain <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and altered brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also performed a neuropathological investigation in order to analyze whether the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> may be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To address these questions we used three- and fourteen-month-old <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> receptor-deficient mice (LDLr-/-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The current findings provide new evidence that aged LDLr-/- mice, exposed to over three-fold cholesterol levels from early life, show working, spatial reference, and procedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairments</z:hpo>, without alterations in motor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">Antioxidant</z:chebi> imbalance and oxidative damage were evidenced by a marked increase in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi> reactive substances levels) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> metabolism (increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> levels, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> reductase, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase activities) together with a significant increase in the AChE activity in the prefrontal cortex of aged hypercholesterolemic LDLr-/- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Notably, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> was not related to brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> in mice, independent of their age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These observations provide new evidence that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> during aging triggers <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> on different types of learning and memory, accompanied by <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> imbalance, oxidative damage, and alterations of cholinergic signaling in brain areas associated with learning and memory processes, particularly in the prefrontal cortex </plain></SENT>
