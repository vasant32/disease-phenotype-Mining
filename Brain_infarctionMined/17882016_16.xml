<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, a neuroprotective effect of G-CSF was reported in a model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to elucidate the potential therapeutic effect of G-CSF for spinal cord injury (SCI) in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that G-CSF is neuroprotective against <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of cerebellar granule neurons in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we used a mouse model of compressive SCI to examine the neuroprotective potential of G-CSF in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histologic assessment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi> staining revealed that the number of surviving neurons in the injured spinal cord was significantly increased in G-CSF-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry for neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> revealed that G-CSF suppressed neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> after SCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, administration of G-CSF promoted hindlimb functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Examination of signaling pathways downstream of the G-CSF receptor suggests that G-CSF might promote functional recovery by inhibiting neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> after SCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>G-CSF is currently used in the clinic for hematopoietic stimulation, and its ongoing clinical trial for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> makes it an appealing molecule that could be rapidly placed into trials for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> SCI </plain></SENT>
