<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a case of a 35-year-old man who died of a brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> 20 months after radiotherapy for <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the tonsil with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> to the cervical lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histology revealed mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, necrotizing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, and occlusive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significant changes were observed in the vasa vasorum: swelling and detachment of the endothelium, subendothelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, hyaline change, fibrinoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of the vessel walls with mononuclear cellular infiltration, accompanied by focal haemorrhages and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the periadventitial soft tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We believe that these changes of the vasa vasorum and necrotizing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> are causally related and that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> represents focal ischaemic necroses with inflammatory reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings support the hypothesis, based on experimental studies, that injury to the vasa vasorum is an important mechanism in the development of radiation-induced vasculopathy of large arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They also suggest an evolution of the injury to the vasa vasorum and periadventitial tissue from the early lesions described in our patient, to late stages resulting in dense periadventitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> as reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suggest that injury to the vasa vasorum and the consequent ischaemic lesions of the arterial wall are morphological features distinguishing radiation-induced arterial injury from spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
