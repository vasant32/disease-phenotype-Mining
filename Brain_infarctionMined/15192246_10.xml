<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Increased soluble thrombomodulin (sTM) concentration has been associated with recurrent coronary events, whereas in one prospective study it predicted fewer first-ever coronary events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One study found no relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (BI) and sTM levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects of the Etude <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">du</z:e> Profil Génétique de l'Infarctus Cérébral (GENIC) cohort and those free of previous vascular history, we investigated the relationship between sTM level and BI risk, and among cases, its relationship with BI prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with BI (n=492) were consecutively recruited from 12 centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hospital controls without a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n=492) were individually matched for age, sex, and center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were collected after hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Determination of sTM levels was centralized in a single laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Soluble TM concentration significantly increased with age and hypertensive status, but was similar in cases and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With analyses restricted to 278 pairs of subjects with no previous vascular history, sTM concentration &gt;59.6 microg/L (second and third tertiles compared with the first) was associated with fewer first-ever BI (adjusted odds ratio of 0.56 (95% CI, 0.35 to 0.89; P=0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the cases, increased sTM concentration was associated with a higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate after a median follow-up of 5.2 (1.4 to 6.4) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The adjusted hazard ratio per 1 SD of sTM concentration increase (34.2 microg/L) was 1.19 (95% CI, 1.02 to 1.39; P=0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased sTM concentration may be protective against BI in subjects with no previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, whereas it may predict a fatal outcome in patients who have already had a BI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Consequently, sTM levels should be interpreted according to vascular history </plain></SENT>
