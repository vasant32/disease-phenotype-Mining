<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to determine the neuron-specific enolase (NSE) concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma in patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (BI) and analyze the correlation between the measured NSE concentration and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and the degree of neurological and functional deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study included 55 patients aged 56-68 with BI in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The control group consisted of 16 patients subjected to diagnostic radiculography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed a significant increase of NSE concentration within the first seven days in patients compared to the controls (2.838 +/- 0.504 ng/ml CSF and 4.479 +/- 0.893 ng/ml plasma) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was found between NSE concentration and infarction volume and the degree of neurological and functional deficit both in the CSF (r = 0.828, r = 0.735, r = 0.796; p &lt; 0.001) and in plasma (r = 0.810, r = 0.681, r = 0.783; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that an early determination of this marker in CSF and plasma in patients with BI could be a valuable diagnostic factor </plain></SENT>
