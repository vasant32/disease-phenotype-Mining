<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined plasma sRAGE levels associated with clinical features in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma sRAGE was measured in 482 patients (318 men; mean age 71 years) admitted within three days of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median values of sRAGE were significantly different among <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes (p=0.001); 1010 pg/ml in atherothrombotic infarction, 933 pg/ml in lacunar, 1280pg/ml in cardioembolic infarction, 1050 pg/ml in other types of infarctions, and 943 pg/ml in primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The low level of sRAGE was associated with severe leukoaraiosis, reflecting long-standing presence of hypertensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RAGE signaling can contribute to the deterioration of neuronal damage under severe leukoaraiosis, result in a high NIHSS score on admission in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, especially those with smoking habits </plain></SENT>
