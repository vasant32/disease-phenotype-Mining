<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Images of one cat which had undergone ligation of the middle cerebral artery three weeks previously showed brain changes associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and compared favorably with findings on computed tomography (CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The NMR images have millimetric spatial resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NMR parameters inherent in the tissues provide intensity variations and are sufficiently sensitive to yield contrast resolution surpassing that of CT </plain></SENT>
