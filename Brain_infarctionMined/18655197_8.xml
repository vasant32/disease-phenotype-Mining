<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HI produces a broad spectrum of neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> phenotypes ranging from a more noninflammatory apoptotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> to a more inflammatory necrotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> that may be responsible for the broad spectrum of reported dysfunctional outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms that would account for this phenotypic spectrum of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> are not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we provide evidence that Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) can shuttle to different subcellular compartments in response to HI, thus triggering the different organelle-associated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> signaling cascades resulting in cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> phenotype diversity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was an early increase in intranuclear and total nuclear Bax protein levels followed by a later Bax redistribution to the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associated with the organelle-specific Bax shuttling time course, there was an increase in nuclear phosphorylated p53, cytosolic cleaved caspase-3, and caspase-12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When HI-treated P7 rats were resuscitated with 100% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> (HHI), there were increased lesion volumes as determined by T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging with no change in cortical apoptotic signaling compared with HI treatment alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was, however, increased inflammatory (cytosolic-cleaved interleukin-1beta) and necrotic (increased nuclear 55-kDa-cleaved PARP-1 [poly-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi> 1] and decreased nuclear HMGB1 [nuclear high-mobility group box 1]) after HHI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, HHI increased ER calpain activation and ER Bax protein levels compared with HI alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that 100% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> resuscitation increases Bax-mediated activation of ER cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> signaling, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and lesion volume by increasing necrotic-like cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In light of these findings, the use of 100% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> treatment for neonatal HI should be reevaluated </plain></SENT>
