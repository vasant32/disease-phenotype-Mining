<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A considerable body of evidence supports the notion that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar lesions</z:e> lead to neuropsychological deficits, including impairments in working-memory, executive tasks and verbal fluency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies employing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and anatomical tracing in primates provide evidence for a cortico-cerebellar circuitry as the functional substrate of working-memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present fMRI study explores the activation pattern during an n-back working-memory task in patients with an isolated cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine each patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, neuropsychological tests of working-memory and attention were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conducted fMRI in nine patients and nine healthy age-matched controls while they performed a 2-back task in a blocked-design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both groups we found bilateral activations in a widespread cortico-cerebellar network, consisting of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 44, 45), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 9, 46), parietal cortex (BA 7, 40), pre-supplementary motor area (BA 6) anterior cingulate (BA 32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relative to healthy controls, patients with isolated cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> demonstrated significantly more pronounced BOLD-activations in the precuneus and the angular gyrus during the 2-back task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The significant increase in activation in the posterior parietal areas of the cerebellar patients could be attributed to a compensatory recruitment to maintain task performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar lesions</z:e> affect remote cortical regions that are part of a putative cortico-cerebellar network </plain></SENT>
