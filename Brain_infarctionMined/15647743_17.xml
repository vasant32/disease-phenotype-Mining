<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The expression profile of the protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) and effects of PAR-2 gene knockout (PAR-2 KO) on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size were investigated after 60 minutes of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) in mice in relation to phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) and astrocyte activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PAR-2 was normally distributed mainly in neurons of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>), and strongly upregulated at 8-24 hours after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Deficiency of PAR-2 gene significantly increased the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and the number of TUNEL-positive cells at 24 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The strong neuronal expression of p-ERK was induced at 5 minutes as a peak after reperfusion in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, but the signal change was significantly reduced in PAR-2 KO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Astroglial activation was also greatly inhibited at 24 hours after tMCAO in PAR-2 KO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results show that the deficiency of PAR-2 gene increases the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic cerebral injury associating with suppression of neuronal ERK activation and reactive astroglial activation </plain></SENT>
