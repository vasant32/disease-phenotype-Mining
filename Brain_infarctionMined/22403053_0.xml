<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is unclear whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in patients with spontaneous cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissection</z:e> (CAD) are due to secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> or to a reduction in cerebral blood flow from the primary cervical lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify the most likely mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> using cervical and cerebral imaging parameters in patients with CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Informed consent was waived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively evaluated the cerebrovascular ultrasound, cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> brain MRI in consecutive patients with CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An embolic mechanism was considered in the case of direct visualization of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752140" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial embolism</z:e> as a susceptibility vessel sign on T2* or in the case of pial artery territory infarction on diffusion-weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A hemodynamic mechanism was considered in the case of watershed infarction and in the case of an association of watershed infarction and pial artery territory infarction when â‰¥ 2 of the following were present: severe stenotic or occlusive CAD, reduced intracranial velocity on cerebrovascular ultrasound or signal on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography, or hyperintense vessel sign on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients were considered to have a mixed mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 172 consecutive patients with CAD, 100 (58%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on diffusion-weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> was attributed to a thromboembolic mechanism in 85 of 100 patients, a hemodynamic mechanism in 12 of 100 patients, and a mixed mechanism in 3 of 100 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> in patients with CAD is most frequently associated with both direct and indirect signs of artery-to-artery embolization on imaging, a finding that should help design future therapeutic trials </plain></SENT>
