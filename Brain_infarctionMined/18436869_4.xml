<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are usually regarded as benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but population-based studies are required to assess the exact place of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype in cerebrovascular pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated trends in incidence rates, risk factor profiles, and survival rates in symptomatic lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from a prospective population-based registry from 1989 to 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We recorded 2536 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among these, 715 (28%) were lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (354 men and 361 women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From 1989 to 2006, we observed a significant rise in the incidence of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the 2 sexes considered together (relative risk, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.005 to 1.035; P=0.007), whereas the variation was not significant in either men or women when considered separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates significantly increased in young patients under 65 years old (relative risk, 1.049; 95% CI, 1.0175 to 1.0817; P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concerning the distribution of cerebrovascular risk factors, lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> differed from nonlacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> only with regard to the lower prevalence of a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in the former (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, survival rates were 96% at 1 month (95% CI, 0.94 to 0.97), 86% at 1 year (95% CI, 0.83 to 0.89), and 78% at 2 years (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.81) and were significantly higher than those for nonlacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (hazard ratio, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.70 to 2.47; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a significant increase in the incidence rates of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with a relatively good short-term prognosis in terms of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The association among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, and lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was no stronger than the association between these 2 risk factors and nonlacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
