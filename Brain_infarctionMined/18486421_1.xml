<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Microthrombi are undoubtedly the most common embolic material in the cerebral circulation, originating from even minor irregularities of the arterial wall, fibrillating atria, cardiac valves, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Thrombus</z:e> fragments are globular and likely to completely obstruct terminal vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, previous work with "atheroemboli" of needle-like cholesterol crystals rarely cause occlusions or infarctions instead creating small foci of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this work, we asked if microthrombi would occlude terminal vessels and create lacunar type infarctions in the subcortical tissues of the rat brain where, as in human brain, collateral flow is limited relative to the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three treatment groups of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> groups underwent general anesthesia with monitoring of temperature and blood pressure during cannulation of the right internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the group embolized with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> fragments (n = 12), animals had injections of 300 fragments of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> size 60 to 100 microns, the cholesterol group (n = 6) had injections of 300 cholesterol crystals of similar size, and the control group (n = 4) had injections of saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brains were harvested at 4 days with perfusion fixation and were examined by immunohistochemical staining for breaks in the blood brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) (albumin), microglial activation (CD11b), astrocyte activation (GFAP), and infarction (loss of NeuN staining) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Size and location of the areas of injury and infarction were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clot fragments caused discreet <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in 10/12 animals that were 0.1-1.7 mm in diameter and coincided with activation of microglia and astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In some areas, <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was already underway at this early time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Consistent with our previous work, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> caused by cholesterol crystals were smaller (P = .014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Foci of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption and microglial activation were distributed throughout the brain whereas areas of infarction were found almost exclusively in subcortical tissues (P = .029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Injecting microthrombi reproducibly caused areas of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> resembling lacunar type infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These were primarily located in the striatum and thalamus presumably because these areas lack the branching, collateral network seen in the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In addition, these data give further evidence that the extent of brain injury from emboli depends upon composition and shape as well as size </plain></SENT>
