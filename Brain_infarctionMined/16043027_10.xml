<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HO consists of two isozymes: HO-1, which is an <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>-response protein, and HO-2, which is constitutively expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HO-2 accounts for most HO activity within the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Its posttranslational modifications and/or interactions with other proteins make HO-2 a unique regulator of cellular homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our previous results revealed that brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was enlarged in HO-2 knockout mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A similar neuroprotective role of HO-2 was shown using primary cortical neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To better understand the neuroprotective mechanism of HO-2, we used a catalytically inactive mutant, HO-2H45A, and investigated its cellular effects in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi>-induced cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed that HO-2WT overexpression in the HEK293 cell lines became less sensitive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi>, whereas the inactive mutant HO-2H45A was more sensitive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi> as compared to control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, HO-2WT- and HO-2H45A-overexpressing cells were both protected against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and had less oxidatively modified proteins as compared to control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that when HO-2 cannot metabolize the prooxidant <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi>, more cytotoxicity is found, whereas, interestingly, the catalytically inactive HO-2H45A was also able to protect cells against <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the multiplicity of action of the HO-2 protein itself </plain></SENT>
