<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Early ischemic change after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> can be demonstrated with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and quantified by measuring the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) and/or lesion volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the reliability and reproducibility of lesion volume and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> measurement on DWI images, and discuss the implications for clinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using 38 DWI scans from 15 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, two observers (a physicist and a neuroscience graduate) blind to each other, recorded the lesion volume on DWI sequences, measured the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values in this volume and calculated the ratio of ischemic: control <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> (ADCr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One observer repeated his measurements blind to his first, and also examined the effect on lesion volume and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> of deliberately varying by only one pixel, the outline of the visible boundary of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inter and intra-rater reliability were worse for lesion volume than <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> or ADCr measurements: lesion volume, inter-rater coefficient of variation (CoV) 85 +/- 130%, intra-rater CoV 20+/-SD80% (p &lt; 0.05); <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> inter-rater CoV 7.7 +/- SD 19%, intra-rater CoV 0.2 +/- SD 12% (p = NS); and ADCr inter-rater CoV 8 +/- SD27%, intra-rater CoV 0.8 +/- SD73% (p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Altering the position of the outline tracing of the lesion boundary by one pixel altered the measured volumes by 22 +/- SD25% (p &lt; 0.05), but <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values were altered by only 2.9 +/- SD4.9% and ADCr by 2.7 +/- SD4.8% (p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and ADCr values are more reliable and reproducible than DWI lesion size in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> because altering where the lesion boundary is measured has a much greater impact on lesion volume than on the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> or ADCr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This effect is greatest in large lesions </plain></SENT>
