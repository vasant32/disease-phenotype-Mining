<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We found previously that the measurement of plasma levels of protein-conjugated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> (PC-Acro) together with IL-6 and CRP can be used to identify silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (SBI) with high sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to clarify how three biochemical markers are correlated to SBI, carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (CA) and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The levels of PC-Acro, IL-6 and CRP in plasma were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SBI and WMH were evaluated by MRI, and CA was evaluated by duplex carotid ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 790 apparently healthy volunteers were classified into 260 control, 214 SBI, 263 CA and 245 WMH subjects, which included 187 subjects with two or three pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the combined measurements of PC-Acro, IL-6 and CRP were evaluated together with age, using a receiver operating characteristic curve and artificial neural networks, the relative risk value (RRV), an indicator of tissue damage, was in the order SBI with CA (0.90)&gt;SBI (0.80)&gt;CA (0.76)&gt;WMH with CA (0.65)&gt;WMH (0.46)&gt;control (0.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RRV was also correlated with severity in each group of SBI, CA and WMH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The RRV supports the idea that the degree of risk to develop a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is in the order SBI&gt;CA&gt;WMH </plain></SENT>
