<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE A low risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> has previously been reported, but follow-up has been limited to &lt;/=5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred eighty patients with pure motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, collected between 1983 and 1986 from a hospital-based <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry, were followed up until at least 10 years after the index <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two patients were lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival status was determined from the official population registry and compared with survival rates of the Swedish population, matched for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to identify independent prognostic predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During follow-up 106 (60%) of the 178 patients died, most commonly as a result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the first 5 years after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, survival rates were similar to those of the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Beyond this time the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was increased among patients with pure motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, with an excess of 10 to 15 percent units compared with the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Independent determinants for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were age (P&lt;0.01), male sex (P&lt;0.01), and nonuse of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred in 42 (23.5%) of the patients, corresponding to an annual risk of 2.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> (P=0.025) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P=0.024) were independent risk factors for recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For the first few years after lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was similar to that of the general population, but later a clear excess of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The long-term prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> appears less favorable than previously reported </plain></SENT>
