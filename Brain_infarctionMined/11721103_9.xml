<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Since little is known concerning factors which may influence long-term prognosis of patients presenting with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we conducted a longitudinal study of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Variables likely to affect outcome were assessed at baseline, including those from transoesophageal echocardiographic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients presenting with first-ever lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> underwent diagnostic workup that included brain CT or MRI, carotid duplex, and transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An assessment of patients was planned at entry (baseline), and thereafter every 12 months (clinic visit or telephone call), drop-out, or endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was nonfatal or fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoint was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to any cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 60 consecutive lacunar patients with the mean follow-up period of 3.9 years, 12 patients (20%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean annual rate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 5.2%, and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> 2.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, the following three variables with the values of p &lt; 0.1 after univariate testing were chosen: age (p = 0.095); aortic atheroma (p = 0.066); and any source of embolism from heart (p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Any source of embolism from heart was the only factor which significantly enhanced the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence (p = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using Kaplan-Meier life table analysis, the curves of percent free of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were significantly different (log rank test p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Until the mechanism of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is better understood, it is reasonable to suggest that its investigation and prevention should be directed at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> potential causes of future <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> including cardioembolism </plain></SENT>
