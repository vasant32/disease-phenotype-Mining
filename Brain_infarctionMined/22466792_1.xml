<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Animal models suggest that a month of heightened plasticity occurs in the brain after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, accompanied by most of the recovery from impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This period of peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and remote plasticity is associated with changes in excitatory/inhibitory balance and the spatial extent and activation of cortical maps and structural remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The best time for experience and training to improve outcome is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In animal models, very early (&lt;5 days from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) and intense training may lead to increased histological damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversely, late rehabilitation (&gt;30 days) is much less effective both in terms of outcome and morphological changes associated with plasticity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In clinical practice, rehabilitation after disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> involves a relatively brief period of inpatient therapy that does not come close to matching intensity levels investigated in animal models and includes the training of compensatory strategies that have minimal impact on impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Current rehabilitation treatments have a disappointingly modest effect on impairment early or late after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Translation from animal models will require the following: (1) substantial increases in the intensity and dosage of treatments offered in the first month after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with an emphasis on impairment; (2) combinational approaches such as noninvasive brain stimulation with robotics, based on current understanding of motor learning and brain plasticity; and (3) research that emphasizes mechanistic phase II studies over premature phase III clinical trials </plain></SENT>
