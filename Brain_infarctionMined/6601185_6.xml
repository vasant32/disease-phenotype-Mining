<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The carbohydrates were extracted from the cells with dilute HCI and the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was isolated and purified using high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The manipulations in the hot cell are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the material (gas liquid chromatography and HPLC) showed that the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> obtained was radiochemically pure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The total incorporation of the 11CO2 added to the algae was 60-80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The radiochemical yield of pure carrier-added <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was approximately 25%, at 40 min after E.O.B. including the HPLC purification and <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> filtration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The C-11 glucose uptake in rat brain was compared with that of commercial D[U-14C]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and preliminary PET studies with D-[<z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in a patient with a brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> are presented </plain></SENT>
