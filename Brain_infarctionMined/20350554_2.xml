<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MAIN METHOD: The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26689">1O2</z:chebi> scavenging activity was examined by direct analysis of near-infrared luminescence in a cell-free system and by fluorospectrometry in the presence of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The protective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26689">1O2</z:chebi>-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were examined, using rat neuronal B50 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was evaluated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiration (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay), confocal microscopy and time-lapse imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The chemical reaction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26689">1O2</z:chebi> was examined by production analysis using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: When <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose Bengal</z:chebi> (RB) in D2O was irradiated by a 514nm laser beam, the signal of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26689">1O2</z:chebi> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">Edaravone</z:chebi> suppressed the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26689">1O2</z:chebi> signal more potently than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40910">azide</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26689">1O2</z:chebi> scavenger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When B50 cells were irradiated by 525nm green light in the RB solution, production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26689">1O2</z:chebi> and induction of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The fluorospectrometric study and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay revealed that 100-400microM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> suppressed the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26689">1O2</z:chebi> production and attenuated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in a concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Confocal microscopy and the time-lapse imaging revealed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> prevented the impairment of membrane integrity and the progression of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26689">1O2</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The HPLC study revealed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> chemically reacted with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26689">1O2</z:chebi> and changed another compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: Since <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26689">1O2</z:chebi> is possibly involved in post-ischemic neuronal damage, the clinically approved curative effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> might be attributed to its potent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26689">1O2</z:chebi> scavenging activity </plain></SENT>
