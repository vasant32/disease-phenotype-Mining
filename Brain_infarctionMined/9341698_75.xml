<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report investigates SSBI, detected by MRI, as a clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MRI scans were performed in 933 neurologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adults (30 to 81 years; mean age, 57.5 +/- 9.2 years) without history of cerebrovascular diseases who received our health screening of the brain 1 to 7 years before investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We obtained information of their clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> through sending out a questionnaire for subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We detected SSBI (focal T2 hyperintensities larger than 3 mm with correlative T1 hypointensity), FWT2HL (focal white matter T2 hypertensity lesions similar to SSBI but without correlative T2-hypointensity), and PVH (periventricular hyperintensity) by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age, sex, family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, hematocrit, blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, smoking, alcohol habits, ischemic changes on electrocardiogram, and sclerotic changes of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arteries were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Incidence of SSBI was 10.6% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was detected in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR], 4.07; 95% CI, 2.57 to 6.45), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.20 to 4.85), alcohol habits &gt; or = 58 g/day (OR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.50 to 4.45), <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.32 to 2.38), and age (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.32 to 2.38) were significant and independent risk factors for SSBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For FWT2HL, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR, 4.49; 95% CI, 2.54 to 7.96) and age (OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.45 to 3.00) were also independent risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for PVH were age (OR, 3.46; 95% CI, 2.23 to 5.36), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR, 3.06; 95% CI, 1.62 to 5.78), and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.02 to 4.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We found 14 brain infarctions, 4 brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp>, and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> during observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Annual incidence of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was higher in the subjects with SSBI than in those without focal lesions (10.1% versus 0.77%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>ORs for clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were 10.48 for SSBI (95% CI, 3.63 to 30.21) and 4.81 for FWT2HL (95% CI, 1.13 to 20.58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The PVH did not relate to clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The strong association of SSBI, FWT2HL, and PVH with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> suggests a common underlying mechanism (presumably small-vessel vasculopathy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The SSBI showed the most significant association for clinical subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The FWT2HL was also a risk factor for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> but was less significant than SSBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The subjects with SSBI should be considered at high risk for clinical subcortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> or brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
