<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the relationship of linguistic ability in early life to the neuropathology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The analyses were done on a subset of 74 participants in the Nun Study for whom we had handwritten autobiographies completed some time between the ages of 19 and 37 (mean = 23 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An average of 62 years after writing the autobiographies, when the participants were 78 to 97 years old, they died and their brains were removed for our neuropathologic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linguistic ability in early life was measured by the idea (proposition) density of the autobiographies, i.e., a standard measure of the content of ideas in text samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Idea density scores from early life had strong inverse correlations with the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> pathology in the neocortex: Correlations between idea density scores and neurofibrillary tangle counts were -0.59 for the frontal lobe, -0.48 for the temporal lobe, and -0.49 for the parietal lobe (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p values &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Idea density scores were unrelated to the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the major arteries at the base of the brain and to the presence of lacunar and large brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Low linguistic ability in early life may reflect suboptimal neurological and cognitive development, which might increase susceptibility to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> pathology in late life </plain></SENT>
