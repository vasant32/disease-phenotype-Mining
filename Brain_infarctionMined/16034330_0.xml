<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> is a clinical diagnosis, but there is uncertainty as to the relative risks of surgery in patients with a visible infarction on brain CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is not clear whether visible infarction is associated with higher operative risk and poor outcome or is simply an indicator of a more "severe" <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some studies have indicated that CT evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> carries an increased risk, other studies have found that patients with a low density and without significant shift on CT, with a stable neurological deficit and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level of consciousness can safely undergo carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to answer a the specific question whether visible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> on CT increases the operative risk of carotid endarterectomy, with special attention to the neurological complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This analysis involved 105 patients with a visible brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> on CT scan who underwent carotid endarterectomy in Vilnius University Emergency Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carotid endarterectomy was performed in 86 men and in 19 women with mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> 87%, ranging from 42% to 99% by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were present in 95 patients (86 carotid and 9 vertebrobasilar) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Carotid endarterectomy underwent 76 patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, 16 patients with symptoms of contralateral carotid artery, 9 patients with vertebrobasilar symptoms and 4 patients with nonspecific symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among symptomatic patients there were 46 patients with unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and 30 patients with bilateral stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Angiography of asymptomatic patients (n=29) revealed unilateral carotid lesions in 9 cases, bilateral stenosis in 8 patients and concomitant bilateral carotid and vertebral stenosis in 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The postoperative mortality rate was 2.9%, a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred in 1.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The total rate of complications--4.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with visible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> on CT scan can safely undergo carotid endarterectomy with a standard operative risk, but risks modelling will be required if we are to target surgery most effectively at individuals </plain></SENT>
