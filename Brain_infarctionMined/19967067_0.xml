<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanisms known as preconditioning (PC)-induced ischemic tolerance are not completely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether kinetic changes of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 during reperfusion time-periods after PC were related to ischemic tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were given PC by occlusion of middle cerebral artery (MCAO) for 10 min and sacrificed after the indicated time-periods of reperfusion (1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18 or 24 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In PC-treated rats, focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced by occlusion of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> for 24 h and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was then studied to determine whether different reperfusion time influenced the damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We report that the most significant protection against focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was obtained in rats with 8 h reperfusion after PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> (10 mg/kg, oral) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8887">rofecoxib</z:chebi> (5 mg/kg, oral) 48 h prior to PC counteracted the effect of PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis showed that COX-2 and HO-1 protein were induced in PC-treated rat brain, which was significantly inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8887">rofecoxib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, we concluded that the kinetic changes of COX-2 expression during the reperfusion period after PC might be partly responsible for ischemic tolerance </plain></SENT>
