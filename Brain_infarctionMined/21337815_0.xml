<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurologic complications are seen in up to 40% of patients with infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> and are the presenting symptom in a substantial percentage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe in detail the clinical scenarios of three patients admitted to our hospital, compare their characteristics and review the recent literature describing neurologic manifestations of infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our patients demonstrate that infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> can develop without comorbidity or a valvular defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our patients were young and lacked the most common symptom of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common neurologic manifestations were focal neurologic deficits and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> should always be considered in patients presenting with new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> neurologic complaints, especially in those without comorbidities or other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A prompt diagnosis should be reached and antibiotic treatment initiated as soon as possible </plain></SENT>
