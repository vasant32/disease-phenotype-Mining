<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cellular rescue in the penumbra region by (-)-D-deprenyl administration was examined after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(-)-D-Deprenyl was given continuously following permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two days later, the rats were killed and their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coronal brain sections were stained with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16991">deoxyribonucleic acid</z:chebi> (DNA) nick-end labelling (TUNEL) and caspase-3, TUNEL and anti-neuronal nuclei (NeuN) double labelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neural plasticity was characterized by growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 1000 x 1000-microm region was sampled at both cortical margins of the TUNEL-positive area at its borders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The numbers of TUNEL-labelled and TUNEL-caspase-3-labelled cells decreased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(-)-D-Deprenyl treatment increased the number of GAP-43-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that (-)-D-deprenyl reduced the number of affected cells and induced neuronal plasticity </plain></SENT>
