<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> is the most prevalent disease involving the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since medical modalities are sometimes ineffective for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> following massive infarction, surgical decompression may be an effective option when medical treatments fail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to assess the outcome and prognostic factors of decompressive surgery in life threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, severe, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed twenty-six patients (17 males and 9 females; average age, 49.7yrs) who underwent decompressive surgery for severe cerebral or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> from January 2003 to December 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgical indication was based on the clinical signs such as neurological deterioration, pupillary reflex, and radiological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was assessed by Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 26 patients, 5 (19.2%) showed good recovery, 5 (19.2%) showed moderate disability, 2 (7.7%) severe disability, 6 (23.1%) persistent experienced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917808" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vegetative state</z:e>, and 8 (30.8%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this study, the surgical decompression improved outcome for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e>, but decompressive surgery did not show a good result for <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction (30.8% overall mortality vs 100% mortality) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The dominant-hemisphere <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> showed worse prognosis, compared with nondominant-hemisphere <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (54.5% vs 70%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Poor prognostic factors were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, dominant-hemisphere <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and low preoperative Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale (GCS) score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The patients who exhibit clinical deterioration despite aggressive medical management following severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> should be considered for decompressive surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For better outcome, prompt surgical treatment is mandatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We recommend that patients with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> should be referred to neurosurgical department primarily in emergency setting or as early as possible for such prompt surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
