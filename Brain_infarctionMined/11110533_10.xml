<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to determine whether high-b-value diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging improved contrast and detection of signal changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> scans of 30 subjects with a history of possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> on a 1.5-T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imager with 40 mT/meter gradients (slew rate 150 T/m/s) by use of the following single-shot echo-planar diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> sequences: 1) 7,999/ 71.4/1 (TR/TE/excitations, b = 1,000; 2) 999/ 88.1/3, b = 2,500; and 3) 7,999/ 92.1/4, b = 3,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was performed in three orthogonal directions during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were scanned with fast fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) (10,006/145/2,200/1 [TR/TE/TI/excitations]) and fast spin-echo T2-weighted (3,650/95/3 [TR/TE/excitations], echo train length, 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was established by clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty women and 10 men with a mean age of 67.7 years were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One subject was excluded owing to poor image quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twelve of 29 subjects had a clinical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 12 had lesions that were hyperintense on diffusion-weighted images at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three b values; five were cortical and seven subcortical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was increased contrast of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lesions on high-b-value scans (b = 2,500 and 3,000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lesions that were hypointense on diffusion-weighted images were identified and evaluated at the three different b values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At b = 1,000, there were 19 hypointense lesions, whereas at b = 2,500 and 3,000 there were 48 and 55 lesions, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>On FLAIR and T2-weighted images, these low-signal lesions were predominantly <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, subcortical, ischemic lesions and lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, but four <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, one porencephalic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath>, and one primary <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumor</z:mp> were also found </plain></SENT>
