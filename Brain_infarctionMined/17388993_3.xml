<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a population-based, cross-sectional study on residents from two age groups (61- and 72-year olds) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 376 subjects participated in the study, which included brain magnetic resonance image and genetic analysis of the ALDH2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 61- and 72-year-old subjects, 46.4% and 64.3%, respectively, had one or more lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> also increased from 2.0 to 2.8 in men and from 2.3 to 3.5 in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant association between the ALDH2 genotype and the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (&gt; or =1) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e>, the genotype of ALDH2 *1/*1 was associated with a larger number of the lesion ['single' versus 'multiple' odds ratio (OR) 3.73, 95%CI: 1.43-9.74] in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The OR was comparable even after adjusting for alcohol consumption, tobacco habits, age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) (OR 3.88; 95% CI: 1.10-13.66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In women, there was no significant association between the ALDH2 genotypes and lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present study revealed that the ALDH2 *1/*1 genotype was significantly associated with the prevalence of multiple lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in Japanese men </plain></SENT>
