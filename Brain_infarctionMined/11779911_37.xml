<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Cognitive dysfunction</z:e> is a common and disabling sequela of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although several clinical and radiographic findings have been implicated in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> after SAH, few prospective studies have comprehensively and simultaneously evaluated these risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between July 1996 and March 2000, we prospectively evaluated 113 of 248 consecutively admitted nontraumatic SAH patients alive at 3 months with a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Summary scores for 8 cognitive domains were calculated to express test performance relative to the entire study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and radiographic variables associated with domain-specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> were identified with forward stepwise multiple regression, with control for the influence of demographic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study participants were younger (P=0.005), less often white (P=0.006), and had better 3-month modified Rankin scores (P=0.001) than those who did not undergo neuropsychological testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of subjects who scored in the impaired range (&gt;2 SD below the normative mean) on each neuropsychological test ranged from 10% to 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> in 2 or more domains in the multivariate analysis included global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> (4 domains), left-sided infarction (3 domains), and lack of a posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (2 domains) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other variables consistently associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> in the univariate analysis included admission Hunt-Hess grade &gt;2 and thick SAH in the anterior interhemispheric and sylvian fissures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> and left-sided infarction are important risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment strategies aimed at reducing neurological injury related to generalized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e>, infarction, and clot-related hemotoxicity hold the best promise for improving cognitive outcomes after SAH </plain></SENT>
