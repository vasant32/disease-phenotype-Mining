<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The presence of new ischemic brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, detected by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), have been reported in considerable number of patients after cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the role of proximal thoracic aortic atheroma in predicting embolic events and new ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> in patients undergoing conventional coronary revascularization surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transesophageal echocardiography and epiaortic scanning was performed to assess the severity of aortic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the ascending aorta and the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were allocated to either low-risk group, (intimal thickness &lt; or =2mm), or high-risk group (intimal thickness &gt;2mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler was used to monitor the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DW-MRI was performed 3-7 days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The NEECHAM <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>Confusion</z:hpo> Scale was used for assessment and monitoring patient consciousness level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients in the high-risk group were considerably older; 71+/-6 (n=38) versus 67+/-6 (n=72) years, P=0.004 and were more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0005162'>impaired left ventricular function</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>Confusion</z:hpo> was present in 6 (16%) patients in the high-risk group and 5 (7%) patients in the low-risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients in the high-risk group had a three-fold increase in median embolic count, 223.5 versus 70.0, P=0.0003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DW-MRI detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> were only present in patients from high-risk group, 61.5 versus 0%, P&lt;0.0001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was significant correlation between the NEECHAM scores and embolic count in the high-risk group; r=0.63, P&lt;0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this investigation suggest that mild to moderate atheromatous disease of the ascending aorta and the aortic arch (intimal thickness &gt;2mm) is a major contributor to ischemic brain injury after cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
