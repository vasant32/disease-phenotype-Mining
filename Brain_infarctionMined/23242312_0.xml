<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their clinical relevance is controversial, with postulated sequelae ranging from cognitive sparing to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address the consequences of microinfarcts, we used controlled optical methods to create occlusions of individual penetrating arterioles or venules in rat cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Single microinfarcts, targeted to encompass <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> or part of a cortical column, impaired performance in a macrovibrissa-based behavioral task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the targeting of multiple vessels resulted in tissue damage that coalesced across cortex, even though the intervening penetrating vessels were acutely patent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Post-occlusion administration of memantine, a <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> that reduces <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, ameliorated tissue damage and perceptual deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these data imply that microinfarcts likely contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Strategies that have received limited success in the treatment of ischemic injury, which include therapeutics against excitotoxicity, may be successful against the progressive nature of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
