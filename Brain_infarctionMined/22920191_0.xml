<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> remains one of the most common diseases with a serious impact on quality of life but few effective treatments exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (33°C) is a promising neuroprotective therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether a delayed short mild hypothermic treatment is still beneficial as neuroprotective strategy in the endothelin-1 (Et-1) rat model for a transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hours of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (33°C) was induced 20, 60 or 120 minutes after Et-1 infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the experiment the cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured via Laser Doppler Flowmetry in the striatum, which represents the core of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were assessed 24 hours after the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this sub-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induction, the effects of the hypothermic treatment on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, phagocytosis and <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> were assessed as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was determined using caspase-3 immunohistochemistry, phagocytic cells were visualized by CD-68 expression and <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> was studied by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cooling could be postponed up to 1 hour after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the insult without losing its positive effects on neurological deficit and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results correlated with the caspase-3 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the increased CD-68 expression post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was reduced in the core of the insult with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>Hypothermia</z:hpo> also reduced the increased levels of GFAP staining, even when it was delayed up to 2 hours after the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The study confirmed that the induction of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> treatment in the Et-1 model does not affect the CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that in the Et-1 rat model, a short mild hypothermic treatment delayed for 1 hour is still neuroprotective and correlates with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At the same time, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> also establishes a lasting inhibitory effect on the activation of <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
