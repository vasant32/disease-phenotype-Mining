<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Baseline and 3-year follow-up MRI were collected within the LADIS study (n=358) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incident lacunes were characterized with respect to brain region, their appearance within pre-existent white matter hyperintensities (WMH), surrounding WMH size, and risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 106 incident lacunes were observed in 62 patients (58 subcortical white matter [WM], 35 basal ganglia, and 13 infratentorial) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incident subcortical WM lacunes occurred more often within preexisting WMH (P=0.01) and were mostly accompanied by new and expanded WMH (P&lt;0.001), compared to incident basal ganglia and infratentorial lacunes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for incident subcortical WM lacunes were history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> predicted incident basal ganglia/infratentorial lacunes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Differences in relation to WMH and risk factor profiles may suggest that incident lacunes in the subcortical WM have a different pathogenesis than those in the basal ganglia and infratentorial region </plain></SENT>
