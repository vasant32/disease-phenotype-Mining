<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The serum CK-BB activity of 33 patients with ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> was measured with a bioluminescence method (CK-B Kit, LKB-Wallac) in combination with immunoprecipitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with lesions determined by computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the control group (N = 19) there was a mean activity of 0.35 +/- 0.26 U/l (means +/- SE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with small lesions (N = 11) the activity was 0.41 +/- 0.21 U/l, which was not significantly elevated when compared to the control group (Mann/Whitney U test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, patients with more extensive lesions (N = 12) and the group with severe lesions (N = 10) showed a significant elevation, with a mean activity of 0.61 +/- 0.34 U/l and 1.12 +/- 0.52 U/l, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The group with severe lesions had a maximum activity on the first day after the initial symptoms </plain></SENT>
