<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the pathophysiology of these findings remains uncertain, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, a process regulated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (TIMPs), may be implicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the cross-sectional relations of circulating MMP-9 and TIMP-1 to these MRI indices in 583 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-free, Framingham Offspring participants (mean age 57 years, 58% women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using multivariable regression MMP-9 (detectable versus non-detectable) and TIMP-1 (modeled as sex-specific quartiles) were related to LWMH (&gt;1S.D. above age-specific mean; yes/no), SCI (yes/no) and total brain volume (ratio of parenchymal to intracranial volume, TCBVr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean TCBVr was 0.78 (S.D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>0.03), 13% of subjects had LWMH and 12% had SCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Detectable MMP-9 was associated with higher prevalence of LWMH (OR 2.09, 95%confidence interval (CI) 1.00-4.37), but not with TCBVr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TIMP-1 was associated with a high prevalence of LWMH (OR for Q4 versus Q1-3: 1.83, 95%CI 1.06-3.18) and with lower mean TCBVr (Q4 associated with 0.17 S.D. units lower value relative to Q1-3; p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither biomarker was associated with SCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings are preliminary but if confirmed in further studies, suggest a pathophysiological role for the MMP/TIMP pathway in processes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> and aging </plain></SENT>
