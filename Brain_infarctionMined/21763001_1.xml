<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (PSD) is a common consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that negatively interferes with the rehabilitation outcome in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It remains unclear what relationship exists between the site and size of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and the development of PSD and the risk factors for PSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a MRI-based cohort study to examine the radiological correlations for PSD in Chinese patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our study included 163 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of PSD was made with World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WHO-CIDI), which is based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e>-Fourth Edition (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV) during a follow-up exam at 3-month post <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The demographic, clinical, and detailed radiological variables (e.g., lesion location, and degree of white matter lesions) were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The univariate analyses suggested that the frequency of multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, the total number and volume of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were higher in the PSD group than those in the non-PSD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, PSD patients showed higher rates of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in cortical-subcortical area of the frontal and temporal lobe as well as in internal capsule (including genu, anterior and posterior limb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The multivariate analysis suggested that independent radiological risk factors for PSD may include the presence of multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> affecting either side of posterior limb of internal capsule, genu of internal capsule, and cortical-subcortical areas in the temporal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients suggested that certain neuroanatomical factors (i.e., lesions at posterior limb and genu of internal capsule and cortical-subcortical area of the temporal lobe, as well as the presence of multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>) may correlate with the PSD development </plain></SENT>
