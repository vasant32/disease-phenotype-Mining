<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We prospectively studied levels of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and glycohemoglobin, and their correlations with types, severity, and prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 37 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (BI) and 35 patients with brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (BH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that in the BH group, patients with an elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level due to stress, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, or both, had a lower consciousness level on admission, larger <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> size, higher incidence of rupture into the ventricles, and a worse 1-month outcome than patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with BI, however, no significant difference was found as related to levels of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, though a difference in 6-month mortality between stress hyperglycemic and normoglycemic patients (p less than 0.05) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conclude that an elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level is associated with a worse clinical condition, larger <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> size, higher incidence of rupture into the ventricles, and worse outcome in patients with BH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, it seems to be the severity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, not the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, that causes the poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>Hyperglycemia</z:hpo> may be an epiphenomenon of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity </plain></SENT>
