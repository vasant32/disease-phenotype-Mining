<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It has been suggested that interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a potent inflammatory mediator and that it is synthesized and secreted into the brain parenchyma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study is to evaluate the contribution of IL-1 to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> formation after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The brain water content was measured to evaluate postischemic brain injury in rats after 60 minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of exogenous application of recombinant human interleukin-1 beta (rhIL-1 beta), anti-interleukin-1 beta neutralizing antibodies (anti-IL-1 beta), and the IL-1 blocker <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28783">zinc protoporphyrin</z:chebi> (ZnPP) on brain water content were observed, and histological technique was used to measure the infarction size and number of inflammatory cells infiltrated into the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Transient ischemia</z:e> induced marked increase of brain water content, <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, and neutrophilic infiltration in the cortex perfused by the middle cerebral artery and the dorsal and ventral areas of the caudate putamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Injection of rhIL-1 beta into the left lateral ventricle immediately after reperfusion markedly enhanced ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> formation in these three areas in a dose-dependent manner (88.4 +/- 0.7% and 86.6 +/- 0.4% in the dorsal and ventral parts of the caudate putamen, respectively, in rats treated with 10 ng rhIL-1 beta; P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>rhIL-1 beta also increased the size of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, and it tended to increase the number of infiltrating neutrophils in ischemic areas and the number of neutrophils adherent to the endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, administration of anti-IL-1 beta and ZnPP into the left cerebral ventricle attenuated the postischemic increase of brain water content and decreased the size of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (83.5 +/- 2.0% and 79.9 +/- 2.0% in the dorsal and ventral parts of the caudate putamen, respectively, in rats treated with 10 micrograms anti-IL-1 beta; P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of neutrophils that infiltrated into ischemic areas also tended to decrease with anti-IL-1 beta or ZnPP treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Application of rhIL-1 beta augmented the increase of brain water content, and application of anti-IL-1 beta depressed the increase of water content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results tended to correlate with the neutrophilic infiltration into the parenchyma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It thus appears that IL-1 beta may play an important role in ischemic brain damage after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
