<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Despite several known risk factors it is still difficult to foresee who will develop a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and who will not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vascular brain damage, visualised with MRI, reflects how the brain tolerates the effects of vascular risk factors and may therefore be relevant in predicting individual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the presence of small vessel disease on brain MRI could improve the prediction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> beyond the classic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors from the 1991 Framingham <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Risk Function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 1007 community-dwelling elderly people, free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at baseline were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Small vessel disease--that is, the presence of silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (SBI) and white matter lesions (WML), was scored on MRI scans obtained in 1995-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>10-Year <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk prediction was assessed by the C statistic and by reclassification adding SBI and WML to a risk model including the classic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 10-years of follow-up 99 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Individual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk prediction significantly improved from 0.73 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.78) to 0.75 (0.69 to 0.80) in men and from 0.69 (0.64 to 0.75) to 0.77 (0.71 to 0.82) in women after inclusion of SBI and periventricular WML to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reclassification occurred mainly in the intermediate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk group (men 26%; women 61% reclassified) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of small vessel disease with MRI beyond the classic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors improved the prediction of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, especially in women with an intermediate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings support the use of MRI as a possible tool for better identifying people at high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
