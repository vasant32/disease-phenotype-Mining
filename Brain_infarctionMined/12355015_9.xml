<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> measurements of flow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> (FH) and mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) with follow-up data to determine which method yields better predictive measures of final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> underwent magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage, and the tissue at risk was estimated from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> maps and maps generated by means of detecting abnormal FH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were calculated from T2-weighted follow-up <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> image measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Wilcoxon signed rank test was performed to compare the two predictive maps (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> and FH) with T2-weighted follow-up maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven (48%) patients experienced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> and the FH maps enabled prediction of 10 of these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were five false-positive cases with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> measurement but three with FH measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In terms of predicting final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes, the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size on the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> maps was overestimated by 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size on the FH maps also was overestimated, but by only 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> map measurements were significantly different from follow-up <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> image measurements (P =.005), but FH map measurements were not (P =.059) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FH maps may enable more precise prediction of final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
