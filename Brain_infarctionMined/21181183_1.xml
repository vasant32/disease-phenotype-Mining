<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six consecutive patients with first <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> RH <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> were matched for age, years of education and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity at the time of admission to the emergency department (baseline NIHSS; National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale), compared according to whether (T+) or not (T-) they received thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological (NIHSS at hospital ward; Barthel index; BI) and neuropsychological examinations were conducted 4 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Visuoconstructive abilities were assessed with the block design and visual search and reasoning with the picture completion subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale revised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Visual neglect was assessed with the conventional subtests of the Behavioural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0424101" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Inattention</z:e> test and visual memory with the visual reproduction subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale Revised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T+ and T- patients did not differ in baseline NIHSS, age, years of education, hemianopia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, or in basic ADL (BI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>T- patients had more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (NIHSS at hospital ward) and poorer visuoconstructive abilities than T+ patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that thrombolysis has a favourable effect on visuoperceptual functions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
