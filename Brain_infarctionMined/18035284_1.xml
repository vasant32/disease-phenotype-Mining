<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The detection and management of asymptomatic lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) images are important tasks for radiologists to ensure the prevention of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, accurate identification of the lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images is a difficult task for the radiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore the purpose of this study was to develop a computer-aided diagnosis scheme for the detection of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> to assist radiologists' interpretation as a "second opinion." MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our database comprised 1,143 T1- and 1,143 T2-weighted images obtained from 132 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The locations of the lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were determined by experienced neuroradiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We first segmented the cerebral region in a T1-weighted image by using a region growing technique for restricting the search area of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For identifying the initial lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> candidates, a top-hat transform and multiple-phase binarization were then applied to the T2-weighted image within the segmented cerebral region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For eliminating the false positives (FPs), we determined 12 features--the locations x and y, signal intensity differences in the T1- and T2-weighted images, nodular components from a scale of 1 to 4, and nodular and linear components from a scale of 1 to 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The nodular components and the linear components were obtained using a filter bank technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rule-based schemes and a support vector machine with 12 features were applied to the regions of the initial candidates for distinguishing between lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and FPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our computerized scheme was evaluated by using a holdout method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of the detection of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was 96.8% (90/93) with 0.76 FP per image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our computerized scheme would be useful in assisting radiologists for identifying lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
