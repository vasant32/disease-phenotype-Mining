<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To establish, using brain spiral computerised tomography (SCT) and modified Barthel index (MBI), whether the location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> could be correlated with functional outcome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients who undergo early intensive rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Observational cohort, assessor blinded and correlational prospective 12-weeks study that included 111 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients, admitted consecutively to an early intensive inpatient rehabilitation programme (5 days a week, 3-5 h a day) during 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Confirmation of diagnosis and stratification was done by brain SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain lesion locations were correlated to motor performance and functional outcome, on admission and discharge, using MBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Statistical analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between motor performance, functional outcome and brain lesion locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The groups with deep, combined deep and large superficial, small superficial and large superficial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> showed the most consistent improvement in that order of frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> brain SCT group did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.051) while the bi-hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> group did not show any change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The inter and intra group differences were highly significant (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Immediate non-contrasted brain SCT may act as an independent predictor of final functional outcome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It may provide clinicians with an opportunity to offer realistic expectations to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and their relatives </plain></SENT>
