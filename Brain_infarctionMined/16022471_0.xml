<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A few days later he visited at our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurologically he exibited marked isolated right superior rectus palsy which was also indicated by the Hess test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurological abnormalities</z:hpo> were found such as other ocular muscle <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsies</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, sensory impairement or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI showed a left medial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarction</z:e> extending to a rostral part of the midbrain anterolateral to the cerebral aqueduct at the superior colliculi level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unilateral superior rectus palsy can rarely be caused by a contralateral midbrain infarction, because fibers from the subnucleus subserving the superior rectus decussate within the oculomoter nerve complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this case the crossing fibers toward the contralateral superior rectus may have been selectively involved by a tinny lesion in the area of the oculomotor nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient had a slightly narrowed right palpebral fissure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is indicated that crossing fibers toward the contralateral levator muscle of the eyelid may be also involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> completely resolved two months later after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
