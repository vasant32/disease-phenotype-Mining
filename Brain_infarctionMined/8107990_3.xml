<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the ability of superparamagnetically contrast-enhanced MRI and conventional T2-weighted MRI to detect ischaemic injury early after unilateral occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in 12 male Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Permanent vessel occlusion was achieved by a transvascular approach, which has the advantage of not requiring a craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 45-60 min after the procedure, the animals had conventional T2-weighted MRI before and after administration of a superparamagnetic contrast agent (<z:chebi fb="27" ids="50820">iron oxide</z:chebi> particles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unenhanced images were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After administration of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="50820">iron oxide</z:chebi> particles, the presumed ischaemic area was clearly visible, as relatively increased signal, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals; this high signal area corresponded to the area of ischaemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> seen on histological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Magnetic susceptibility effects of iron particles cause low signal in normally perfused cerebral tissue, whereas tissue with reduced or absent blood flow continues to give relatively high signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that superparamagnetic iron particles may significantly reduce the interval between an ischaemic insult and the appearance of parenchymal changes on MRI </plain></SENT>
