<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two cell lines were used for encapsulated grafting in this experiment, namely, a bFGF-secreting cell line established by genetic manipulation of baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, and a naive BHK cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were divided into the following three groups: those receiving grafts of encapsulated bFGF-secreting cells (BHK-bFGF group); those with grafts of encapsulated naive BHK cells (naive BHK group); and those with no grafts (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors implanted encapsulated cells into the right striatum of host rats in the BHK-bFGF and naive BHK groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six days after grafting, the host and control animals underwent permanent right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) with an intraluminal suture procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was evaluated using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining and computerized image analysis 24 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fragmentations of DNA in the host brains were analyzed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> nick-end labeling 12 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The authors found that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the BHK-bFGF group was reduced by approximately 30% compared with that in the naive BHK and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic penumbral area, the number of apoptotic cells in the BHK-bFGF group was significantly decreased compared with that in the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The grafting of encapsulated BHK bFGF-secreting cells protected the brain from ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Encapsulation and grafting of genetically engineered cells such as bFGF-secreting cells is thus thought to be a useful method for protection against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
