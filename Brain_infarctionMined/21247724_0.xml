<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was a retrospective, nonrandomized, observational study of patients, admitted within 9 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, at 3 academic, university-affiliated hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures were neurologic improvement, defined by improvement in National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score at 7 days or discharge of 4 or more, or achieving a score of 0; symptomatic and asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>; favorable outcome (discharge modified Rankin score 0-2); and in-hospital mortality </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>rt-PA (7.2; 95% CI, 2.7-19.5) and endovascularly treated patients (5.8; 95% CI, 2-16.8) when compared with nonthrombolytic medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A prominently higher rate of neurologic improvement and favorable clinical outcome was observed among <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients 80 years or older treated with i.v </plain></SENT>
