<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently observed a high prevalence (60%) of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 30 splenectomized adults with TI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this work, we further evaluate cerebral involvement in the same 30 patients using fluorodeoxyglucose <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age was 32 years (range, 18-54��years) with a male to female ratio of 13:17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients (63.3%) had evidence of decreased neuronal function on PET-CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Involvement was mostly left sided, multiple, and most commonly in the temporal and parietal lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Elevated liver iron concentration, beyond 15 mg Fe/g dry weight, characterized patients with decreased neuronal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The concordance rate between brain MRI and PET-CT for the detection of brain abnormality was only 36.7% (Kappa 0.056, P = 0.757), highlighting that both modalities reveal different types of brain pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Decreased neuronal function is a common finding in patients with TI and is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the addition of PET-CT to MRI identifies a greater proportion of TI patients with silent neuroimaging abnormalities </plain></SENT>
