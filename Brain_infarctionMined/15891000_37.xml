<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Most previous studies addressed the cognitive impact of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> using radiologic correlations that are known to correlate poorly with neuropathological data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, absence of systematic bilateral assessment of vascular lesions and masking effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> pathology and macrovascular lesions may explain discrepancies among previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To define the relative contribution of silent lacunes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>, we performed a detailed analysis of lacunar and microvascular pathology in both cortical and subcortical areas of 72 elderly individuals without significant neurofibrillary tangle pathology or macrovascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cognitive status was assessed prospectively using the Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating (CDR) scale; neuropathological evaluation included Abeta-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_45'>protein deposition</z:mpath> staging and bilateral assessment of microvascular ischemic pathology and lacunes; statistical analysis included multivariate models controlling for age, amyloid deposits, and microvascular pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thalamic and basal ganglia lacunes were negatively associated with CDR scores; cortical microinfarcts, periventricular and diffuse white matter <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> also significantly affected cognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate model, cortical microinfarcts and thalamic and basal ganglia lacunes explained 22% of CDR variability; amyloid deposits and microvascular pathology explained 12%, and the assessment of thalamic and basal ganglia lacunes added an extra 17% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Deep white matter lacunes were not related to cognitive status in univariate and multivariate models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In agreement with the recently proposed concept of subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, our autopsy series provides important evidence that gray matter lacunes are independent predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in elderly individuals without concomitant dementing processes such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
