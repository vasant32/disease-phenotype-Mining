<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Elevated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> has been associated with a higher prevalence of cerebral white-matter lesions and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and worse cognitive performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This raises the question whether factors involved in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> metabolism, such as vitamin B(12), are also related to these outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the association of several markers of vitamin B(12) status with cerebral white-matter lesions, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and cognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study evaluated the association of plasma concentrations of vitamin B(12), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30860">methylmalonic acid</z:chebi>, holotranscobalamin and transcobalamin saturation with cerebral white-matter lesions and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> at baseline and cognition at baseline and during follow-up among 1019 non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> elderly participants of the population-based Rotterdam Scan Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyses were adjusted for several potential confounders, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Poorer vitamin B(12) status was significantly associated with greater severity of white-matter lesions, in particular periventricular white-matter lesions, in a concentration-related manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for common vascular risk factors (including blood pressure, smoking, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and intima media thickness) did not alter the associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> modestly weakened the associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No association was observed for any of the studied markers of vitamin B(12) status with presence of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and baseline cognition or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that vitamin B(12) status in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range is associated with severity of white-matter lesions, especially periventricular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Given the absence of an association with cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, it is hypothesised that this association is explained by effects on myelin integrity in the brain rather than through vascular mechanisms </plain></SENT>
