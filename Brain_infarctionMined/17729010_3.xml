<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prompt treatment with thrombolytic drugs can restore blood flow and improve recovery from an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of local intraarterial thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rtPA) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) infarctions within 6 hours of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixteen patients (10 females and six males) aged from 42 to 61 years, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were selected for treatment with local i.a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>rtPA up to 6 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient selection was based on clinical examination, computed tomography (CT), and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A clinical evaluation was performed before treatment, at the time of discharge, and 90 days post-procedure on the basis of modified Rankin and NIHSS scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Controls (n = 16, nine females and seven males) aged from 51 to 70 years were treated only with intravenous anticoagulation using i.v. <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The control group was evaluated with multidetector CT (MDCT) angiography performed on entry to the study and at 2-4 hours afterwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight patients (50%) achieved a modified Rankin score of 2 or less as the primary outcome after 90 days follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The secondary clinical outcome at 90-day follow-up was as follows: NIHSS score &lt; or =1, three (19%) of the patients; NIHSS score &gt; or =50% decrease, nine (56%) of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A recanalization rate of 75% was achieved in 12 of the 16 treated patients, but only 12.5% in two of the 16 patients in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>Intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> occurred in two (12.5%) of the patients in the treatment group, but in only one patient (6%) in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the treated group after thrombolysis up to the time of discharge; however, during the 90-day follow-up, two patients died compared to three patients in the control group (19% vs. 12.5% mortality rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> who were treated within 6 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> using intraarterial rtPA thrombolysis had a significantly improved clinical outcome 90 days after the procedure compared to patients treated only with intravenous anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
