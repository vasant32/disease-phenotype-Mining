<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to investigate whether safflor yellow B (SYB) had a protective effect on cerebral ischemic injury and to determine the possible mechanisms in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vivo, Male Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were used to make the model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The behavioral test was used to measure neurological deficit scores for evaluation of the ischemic damage of brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The infarction area of brain was assessed in brain slices stained with 2% solution of 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spectrophotometric assay was used to determine the activities of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GPx), contents of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP) of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the respiratory control ratio (RCR = state 3/state 4) was assessed in the brain mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro, the effect of SYB was tested in cultured fetal cortical cells exposed to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> to identify its neuroprotection against neurons damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results in vivo showed that SYB at doses of 3.0 and 6.0 mg kg(-1) markedly decreased the neurological deficit scores and the infarction area in MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the same time, SYB significantly improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> energy metabolism, decreased <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> content, and increased SOD and GPx activities in ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results in vitro showed that SYB remarkably inhibited neuron damage induced by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> in cultured fetal cortical cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These suggest that SYB might act as a potential neuroprotective agent against the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-induced injury in rat brain through reducing <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxides</z:chebi>, scavenging free radicals, and improving the energy metabolism </plain></SENT>
