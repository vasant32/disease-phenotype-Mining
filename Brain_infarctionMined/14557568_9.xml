<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037315" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sleep-disordered breathing</z:e> (SDB) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and its relationship to prestroke cerebrovascular disease, particularly leukoariosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors studied SDB and CT evidence of prestroke cerebrovascular disease, nonacute <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, and white matter disease (WMD) in 78 previously independent patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects underwent respiratory sleep studies to determine the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>Apnea</z:hpo>-<z:mp ids='MP_0001956'>Hypopnea</z:mp> Index (AHI) and Desaturation Index (DI) 7 to 14 days following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT scans were evaluated for severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> prestroke cerebrovascular disease and WMD severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prestroke cerebrovascular disease was present in 49 (63%) patients and was associated with worse SDB (mean AHI 35 vs 23, p &lt; 0.01; mean DI 28 vs 18, p &lt; 0.05), particularly in men (mean AHI 43 vs 27, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>WMD severity correlated with AHI (r = 0.26, p &lt; 0.05) and age (r = 0.56, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>WMD severity in frontal and basal ganglia areas showed the strongest association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, WMD severity correlated independently with AHI (R(2) = 0.07, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of prestroke cerebrovascular disease and severity of WMD are associated with worse SDB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that either white matter is particularly vulnerable to the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and blood pressure variability associated with SDB or that WMD is a major factor exacerbating SDB following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
