<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The overall goal of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid Antibodies</z:hpo>, Brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath>, and Cognitive and Motor Decline in Aging study is to test the hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) are associated with an increased risk of pathologically proven brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and are related to cognitive and motor decline in aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Putative biologic mechanisms underlying the association of aPL with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and the relation of aPL with clinical outcomes of cognitive and motor impairment, including vascular and other processes, will be examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The design of this longitudinal, clinical-pathologic study involves quantifying four aPL assays, and relating these to brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and to cognitive and motor decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vascular mechanisms assessed using antemortem magnetic resonance neuroimaging and postmortem neuropathology, as well as nonvascular mechanisms of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and blood-brain barrier permeability alterations will be examined as plausible mediators of the relation of aPL to cognitive and motor impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We will take advantage of antemortem biological specimens (longitudinally collected sera and plasma from which aPL, annexins, C-reactive protein, and matrix metalloproteinases will be quantified), and clinical, neuroimaging, and postmortem neuropathologic data from about 800 elderly, community-dwelling women and men who have agreed to brain autopsy at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, participating in one of two ongoing studies of aging: the Religious Orders Study and the Memory and Aging Project </plain></SENT>
