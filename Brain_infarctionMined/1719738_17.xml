<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The ability to perceive and express emotional, as well as number of linguistic prosodic qualities of speech was tested in 20 Swedish-speaking patients with right-sided cortical, as well as purely subcortical brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and in 18 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were assessed by clinical neurological examination, and by CT, EEG, and measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the patients the identification of emotional messages was disturbed, as well as the identification and production of several linguistic prosodic qualities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study supports the claim that prosodic impairment could be linguistic in nature, and not secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0525045" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">affective disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The total degree of anatomical and functional disturbance of the right hemisphere played a role for both the ability to identify emotional messages and for identification of two of the linguistic prosodic qualities tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, it was not possible to find support for the hypothesis that the organization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233743" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">prosody</z:e> in the right hemisphere mirrors that of propositional speech on the left side </plain></SENT>
