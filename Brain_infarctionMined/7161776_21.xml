<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty CT scans on 23 individuals were performed and read blindly and independently by 2 neuroradiologists with an 86% correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Minimal to moderate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was the most frequent finding, both in <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> SLE and controls, severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> seen in 1 patient only, and no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in 3 patients and a single control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 6 patients who had repeated scans, 4 showed no change in the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, 1 had more and 1 less <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients had evidence of multiple brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on scan with or without associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sequential scans in 1 of these patients showed total resolution of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> after 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, there was no correlation between the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> on CT scan and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rather our findings suggest that steroids may be the cause of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
