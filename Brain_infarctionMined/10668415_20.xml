<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">Adenosine</z:chebi> acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain through the activation of four specific G-protein-coupled receptors (the A1, A2A, A2B, and A3 receptors) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The A1 receptor has long been known to mediate neuroprotection, mostly by blockade of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> influx, which results in inhibition of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release and reduction of its excitatory effects at a postsynaptic level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the development of selective A1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> as antiischemic agents has been hampered by their major cardiovascular side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More recently, apparently deleterious effects have been reported following the activation of other <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> receptor subtypes, namely, the A2A and the A3 receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In particular, selective A2A receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> have been demonstrated to markedly reduce cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> in the rat, suggesting that the cerebral A2A receptor may indeed contribute to the development of ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effects evoked by A2A <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> may be due to blockade of presynaptic A2A receptors (which are stimulatory on <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release) and/or to inhibition of A2A receptor-mediated activation of microglial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Even more puzzling data have been reported for the A3 receptor subtype, which can indeed mediate both cell protection and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, simply depending upon the degree of receptor activation and/or specific pathophysiological conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, a mild subthreshold activation of this receptor has been associated with a reinforcement of the cytoskeleton and reduction of spontaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, which may play a role in "ischemic preconditioning" of the brain, according to which a short ischemic period may protect the brain from a subsequent, sustained ischemic insult that would be lethal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a robust and prolonged activation of the A3 receptor has been shown to trigger cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by either <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such apparently opposing actions may be reconciled by hypothesizing that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>-mediated cell killing during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> may be aimed at isolating the most damaged areas to favor those parts of the brain that still retain a chance for functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In fact, both A3 receptor-mediated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and A2A receptor-mediated actions may be viewed as an attempt to selectively kill irreversibly damaged cells in the "core" ischemic area, in order to save space and energy for the surrounding live cells in the "pneumbra" area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hence, the pharmacological modulation of the A2A and A3 receptors via selective ligands may represent a novel strategy in the therapeutic approach to pathologies characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> neurodegenerative events </plain></SENT>
