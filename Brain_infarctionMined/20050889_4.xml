<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Case series with a focus on neurologic involvement are not common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With this study, we intended to evaluate the frequency and types of neurologic manifestations and complications at time of diagnosis and during follow-up of patients with CSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this monocentric study, consecutive patients of our hospital with first diagnosis of CSS based on the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology were included between 2001 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each patient underwent a periodic follow-up with clinical and electrophysiologic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were obtained prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745091" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypereosinophilia</z:e> and a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twelve of 14 patients had a neurologic involvement, mainly as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> multiplex <z:hpo ids='HP_0009831'>mononeuropathy</z:hpo> (eight patients) or an axonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> (three patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients suffered from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> of cranial nerves, and two patients had a cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up period was 31 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With immunosuppressive therapy, 13 patients had no additional neurologic complications, one patient suffered from a cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Initial neurologic symptoms as a result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> improved, but sequelae of axonal damage were persistently detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Even at time of diagnosis of a CSS, neurologic manifestations are common, especially as a multiplex <z:hpo ids='HP_0009831'>mononeuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>With a consequent immunosuppressive therapy, new neurologic complications can be avoided for the most part </plain></SENT>
