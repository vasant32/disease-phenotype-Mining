<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to compare the incidence of new ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> on diffusion-perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences after transcervical CAS performed with carotid flow reversal vs stenting via transfemoral approach with distal filter protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During a 26-month period, 64 consecutive patients diagnosed with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> by ultrasound imaging were assigned to transcervical CAS with carotid flow reversal or a transfemoral approach with a distal filter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Rankin <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale was administered by an independent neurologist, and diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) studies were performed ≤24 hours before and ≤24 to 48 hours after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DW-MRI studies were compared by two neuroradiologists not involved in the study and blinded for time, clinical status, and treatment option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hyperintense DW-MRI signals found after the procedure were interpreted as postoperative ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were assessed at 1, 6, and 12 months after the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The distribution of demographic and pathologic variables was similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> procedures were technically successful, with a mean carotid flow reversal time of 22 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one (70%) and 23 patients (69.69%) were symptomatic in the transcervical and transfemoral groups, respectively (P=.869) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After intervention, new postprocedural DW-MRI ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were found in four transcervical (12.9%) and in 11 transfemoral (33.3%) patients (P=.03), without new neurologic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No major adverse events occurred at 30 days after the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients remained neurologically intact, without an increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale scoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> stents remained patent, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients remained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, age (relative risk [RR], 1.022; P&lt;.001), symptomatic status (RR, 4.109; P&lt;.001), and open-cell vs closed-cell stent design (RR, 2.01; P&lt;.001) were associated with a higher risk of embolization in the transfemoral group but not in the transcervical group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that transcervical carotid stenting with carotid flow reversal carries a significantly lower incidence of new ischemic brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> than that resulting from transfemoral CAS with a distal filter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The transcervical approach with carotid flow reversal may improve the safety of CAS and has the potential to improve results in especially vulnerable patients such as the elderly and symptomatic </plain></SENT>
