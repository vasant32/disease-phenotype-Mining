<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To study the influence of various factors on the health related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients who have suffered a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (BI), with special attention to psychopathological disorders (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective observational study on 45 patients admitted due to a BI, evaluated at 4, 12 and 26 weeks of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Social and demographic data, and medical history were collected; the SF-36 scale was used for the assessment of HRQOL, and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), MMSE, Canadian Neurological Scale, Modified Rankin Scale and other instruments for assessing psychopathological, cognitive, neurological and functional status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A linear regression analysis was performed to identify potential predictors of the SF-36 scores at 26 weeks, introducing, as independent variables, medical and psychiatric history, demographic characteristics and the functional, neuropsychological and psychopathological assessments at 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Valid predictive models for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the SF-36 domains were obtained, in which a history of pre-morbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, higher scores in the NPI and Rankin Scale, and lowest in the Canadian Neurological Scale were the main predictors of a worse HRQOL in the long term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Psychopathology related caregiver's distress (assessed with the NPI) was associated with a lower score in the social function index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDs</z:e> and functional status were the main determinants of HRQOL in patients with BI </plain></SENT>
