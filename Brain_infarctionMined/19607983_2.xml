<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Administration of BEO (0.1-0.5 ml/kg but not 1 ml/kg, given intraperitoneally 1 h before occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, MCAo) significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size after 24 h permanent MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most effective dose (0.5 ml/kg) resulted in a significant reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> extension throughout the brain, especially in the medial striatum and the motor cortex as revealed by TTC staining of tissue slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microdialysis experiments show that BEO (0.5 ml/kg) did not affect basal amino acid levels, whereas it significantly reduced excitatory amino acid, namely <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, efflux in the frontoparietal cortex typically observed following MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blotting experiments demonstrated that these early effects were associated, 24 h after permanent MCAo, to a significant increase in the phosphorylation and activity of the prosurvival kinase, Akt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indeed, BEO significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of the deleterious downstream kinase, GSK-3beta, whose activity is negatively regulated via phosphorylation by Akt </plain></SENT>
