<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cortical hemisphere contralateral to the infarction site plays an important role in functional recovery process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying processes occurring in contralateral hemisphere during recovery has not yet been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that the turnover of synaptic spine of somatosensory cortex (SSC) is increased at 1st week after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in contralateral SSC infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After this period, neuronal circuit is remodeled, and functional compensation is achieved by processing bilateral information to remaining SSC [18] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the present study, to examine whether similar changes are observed in different brain regions, we have induced an infarction in the visual cortex (VC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that the spinal remodeling in contralateral VC was also increased at 1st week after VC <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the magnitude of changes was not as great as those seen in SSC infraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the regional difference may exist in the ability to induce functional recovery after ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
