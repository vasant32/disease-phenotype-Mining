<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that I/R injury and HHcy cause increased cerebrovascular permeability; however, the associated mechanism remains obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, during HHcy, cytochome-c becomes homocysteinylated (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi>-cyto-c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">Cytochrome-c</z:chebi> (cyto-c) transports electrons and facilitates bioenergetics in the system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, its role in autophagy during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tetrahydrocurcumin (THC) is a major herbal <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory agent</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether THC ameliorates autophagy during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury by reducing homocysteinylation of cyto-c in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> pathological condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we employed 8-10-week-old male <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17755">cystathionine</z:chebi>-beta-synthase heterozygote knockout (CBS⁺/⁻) mice (genetically hyperhomocystemic mice) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Experimental group was: CBS⁺/⁻, CBS⁺/⁻ + THC (25 mg/kg in 0.1% DMSO dose); CBS ⁺/⁻/I/R, and CBS⁺/⁻/I/R + THC (25 mg/kg in 0.1% DMSO dose) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> was performed for 30 min and reperfusion for 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>THC was injected intra-peritoneally (I.P.) once daily for a period of 3 days after 30 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area was measured using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Permeability was determined by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and Evans Blue extravasation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The brain tissues were analyzed for <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), damage-regulated autophagy modulator (DRAM), and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16680">S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine</z:chebi> hydrolases (SAHH) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) genes were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Co-immunoprecipitation was used to determine the homocysteinylation of cyto-c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and Evans Blue leakage were reduced in I/R + THC-treated groups as compared to sham-operated groups along with reduced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>THC also decreased oxidative damage and ameliorated the homocysteinylation of cyto-c in-part by MMP-9 activation which leads to autophagy in I/R groups as compared to sham-operated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This study suggests a potential therapeutic role of dietary THC in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
