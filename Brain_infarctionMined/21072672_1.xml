<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate the putative neuroprotective effect of Nigella sativa oil (NSO) treatment against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To induce SAH, rats were injected with 0.3 ml blood into their cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar <z:mp ids='MP_0001189'>albino</z:mp> rats were divided as control, vehicle-treated SAH, and NSO-treated (0.2 ml/kg, intraperitoneally) SAH groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight hours after SAH induction, neurological examination scores were recorded and the rats were decapitated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain tissue samples were taken for blood brain barrier permeability, brain water content, or determination of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) levels, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>-ATPase activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: On the second day of SAH induction, neurological examination scores were increased in SAH groups, while SAH caused significant decreases in brain GSH content and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>-ATPase activity, which were accompanied with significant increases in <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels and MPO activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The histological observation showed vasospasm of the basillary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, NSO treatment markedly improved the neurological scores while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> oxidant responses were prevented, implicating that NSO treatment may be of therapeutic use in preventing <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> due to SAH </plain></SENT>
