<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Altered <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vessel fractal dimensions may act as a surrogate marker for diseased cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a cross-sectional study to investigate fractal properties of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vessels in lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recruited patients presenting with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and patients with minor cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were examined by a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> expert and had MRI at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Digital <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> photographs were taken of both eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Monofractal and multifractal analyses were performed with custom-written semiautomated software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We recruited 183 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventeen were excluded owing to poor photographic quality, leaving 166 patients (86 with lacunar and 80 with cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 67.3 years (SD 11.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were younger but the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and white matter hyperintensities did not differ between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean Dbox (monofractal dimension) was 1.42 (SD 0.02), the mean D0 (multifractal dimension) 1.67 (SD 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>With multivariate analysis, decreased Dbox and D0 (both representing decreased branching complexity) were associated with increasing age and lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype after correcting for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity, and white matter hyperintensity scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype and increasing age are associated with decreased fractal dimensions, suggesting a loss of branching complexity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further studies should concentrate on longitudinal associations with other manifestations of cerebral small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
