<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively examined the association between these lesions and the risk of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and mortality in neurologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed in 2,684 neurologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects with no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (mean age, 58 +/- 7 years old at entry) who underwent our health screening of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the brain screening, we obtained information about clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> using a questionnaire sent annually to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When a subject suffered from medical events, we confirmed the detailed information in a telephone interview and by asking the attending physician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SBI was defined as a focal T2-hyperintensity and T1-hypointensity lesion &gt; 3 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PVH and SWML were graded according to their severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average follow-up period was 6.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> occurred in 102 subjects (3.8%), and 93 subjects died during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was significantly higher in the subjects with SBI than in those without SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Marked PVH and marked SWML independently increased the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (for SBI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factor-adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 3.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.28-5.89; for marked PVH, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factor-adjusted OR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.04-4.17; for marked SWML, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factor-adjusted OR = 2.73, 95% CI = 1.32-5.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Regarding mortality, SBI and marked PVH increased the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (for SBI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factor-adjusted OR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.16-3.29; for PVH, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factor-adjusted OR = 4.01, 95% CI = 1.91-8.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> attributable to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred more frequently in those subjects with SBI, marked PVH, and marked SWML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that SBI, marked PVH, and marked SWML are important risk factors for clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and that SBI and marked PVH also increase the risk of mortality </plain></SENT>
