<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Medical records of eight dogs presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> of neurological signs and a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> as determined by computed tomography (CT) imaging were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective single-centre case review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ischaemic infarction in the territory of the rostral cerebellar artery was identified in three spaniel-breed dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were non-haemorrhagic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Telencephalic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were identified in five dogs, in the territories of the middle cerebral artery (2/5) and rostral cerebral artery (3/5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of these dogs had an ischaemic infarction, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other infarctions appeared haemorrhagic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> dogs were geriatric (â‰¥ 8 years old), with concurrent medical conditions identified in six dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One dog was euthanased after diagnosis because of the severity of its neurological signs and one dog was euthanased as a result of associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> 2 months after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six dogs were alive at least 1 year after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CT is useful in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> in dogs, which can present as a spectrum of images with early changes in attenuation and subtle mass effects detected after infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CT is particularly sensitive for detecting haemorrhagic infarction, but under-represent ischaemic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> when compared with MRI </plain></SENT>
