<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, little is known about temporal and spatial relationships between <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and white matter injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we quantified development of white matter damage, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and a glial limitans at 1, 3, and 7 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> in the rat striatum using immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantitative analysis showed that decreased staining for myelin basic protein and increased staining for damaged myelin basic protein began in the core, coincided with neutrophil infiltration, and progressed outward over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Axon damage (i.e. accumulation of amyloid precursor protein) began at the edge of the lesion, coinciding with substantial microglia/macrophage activation, and progressed into the core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the 7 days, activated microglia/macrophages dramatically increased only in the core and edge of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Detailed spatial analyses revealed that activated microglia/macrophages that surrounded undamaged axon bundles did not express ED1, a marker of phagocytic cells, whereas those inside damaged bundles expressed ED1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results imply different contributions of neutrophils and microglia/macrophages to white matter injury after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The distinct localizations of activated microglia/macrophages imply complex signals that regulate their migration toward and infiltration of damaged white matter </plain></SENT>
