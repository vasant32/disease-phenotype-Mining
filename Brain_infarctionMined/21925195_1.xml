<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>Hypoxia</z:mp> in vitro was modeled using oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) followed by reoxygenation of BV-2 microglial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that treatment of mice that have undergone MCAo/r injury with prodigiosin (10 and 100μg/kg, i.v.) at 1h after <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> ameliorated MCAo/r-induced oxidative/nitrosative stress, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, and neurological deficits in the mice, and enhanced their survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MCAo/r induced a remarkable production in the mouse brains of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a significant increase in protein nitrosylation; this primarily resulted from enhanced expression of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase 2 (gp91(phox)), inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS), and the infiltration of CD11b leukocytes due to breakdown of blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) by activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these changes were significantly diminished by prodigiosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In BV-2 cells, OGD induced ROS and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> production by up-regulating gp91(phox) and iNOS via activation of the NF-κB pathway, and these changes were suppressed by prodigiosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results indicate that prodigiosin reduces gp91(phox) and iNOS expression possibly by impairing NF-κB activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This compromises the activation of microglial and/or inflammatory cells, which then, in turn, mediates prodigiosin's protective effect in the MCAo/r mice </plain></SENT>
