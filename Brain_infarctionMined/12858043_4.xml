<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, imaging studies have shown a bilateral cerebellar activation during unilateral hand movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We questioned whether unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar lesions</z:e> affect pointing movements not only of the ipsilateral hand but also of the contralateral hand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Horizontal saccadic pointing movements of 10 patients with unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarctions</z:e> (infarctions of the posterior inferior or superior cerebellar artery) were compared with those of 19 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The movements were recorded with an infrared video motion analysis system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The peak velocity, time lag, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001310'>dysmetria</z:hpo> of the ipsilateral and contralateral hands were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarctions</z:e> had significantly slower movements not only for the ipsilateral but also for the contralateral arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The time lag of these movements in patients was also significantly larger for both arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there was no significant difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001310'>dysmetria</z:hpo> at the endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that both ipsilateral and contra-lateral movements of patients with unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar lesions</z:e> are slightly impaired </plain></SENT>
