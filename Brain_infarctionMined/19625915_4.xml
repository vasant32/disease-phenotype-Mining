<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: After a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), the primary cause of mortality is secondary brain injury occurring within the first 48 hours after the initial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the unknown pathophysiology of these early events, therapeutic approaches are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (33 degrees C) is among the strongest neuroprotectants known so far, the aim of this study was to investigate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and delayed effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> if applied after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to SAH and randomly assigned to the following groups: 1) SAH under normothermia, 2) SAH followed by 2 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> starting 1 hour after the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and 3) SAH followed by 2 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> starting 3 hours after the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure were continuously measured up to 6 hours after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mortality, neurological deficits, and body weight were assessed from postoperative day 1 to day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain water content and morphological brain damage were quantified 24 hours and 7 days after SAH, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> reduced intracranial pressure (P &lt; 0.001) and posthemorrhagic neurological deficits (P &lt; 0.05) and improved postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> significantly (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mortality, cerebral blood flow, and the formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> were not significantly influenced by mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The current results show that mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (33 degrees C) exhibits sustained neuroprotection if applied up to 3 hours after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> seems to be an effective neuroprotective strategy after SAH and should therefore be evaluated as a treatment option for SAH in patients </plain></SENT>
