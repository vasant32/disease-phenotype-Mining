<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>pMCAO caused a cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> whose size progressively increased after 3, 6, 9, and 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Piracetam (125 mg/kg i.p.), administered 6, 9, and 22 h after pMCAO, did not reduce pMCAO-induced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area size detected at the 24th hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By contrast, when this agent was administered at the doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg, it caused a marked reduction of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This reduction was observed in almost every brain slice affected by pMCAO, although statistical differences (p &lt;0.05) were detected in slices located at 3-5.5 mm posterior to the anterior pole in animals treated with 250 mg/kg piracetam and in slices located at 3.5-5 mm in those receiving 500 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the mean total volumes of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> resulting from pMCAO were calculated, it was observed that in animals which had received piracetam (250 or 500 mg/kg) infarction volume was markedly ( approximately 50%) and significantly (p &lt;0.05) reduced in comparison with saline injected rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, piracetam (250 mg/kg administered i.p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>6, 9, and 22 h after the ischemic insult) significantly reduced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area evaluated 48 h and 7 days after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
