<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The S100B level in peripheral blood samples is reportedly elevated in patients with various central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disorders including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since an elevated peripheral S100B level seems to be related closely to cerebral vascular damage involving a blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) disruption, we hypothesized that the peripheral S100B levels may increase earlier and to a greater extent after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> when the cerebral blood vessels are severely damaged and spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> exists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the relationship between an increase in the serum S100B level and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> was investigated within 24 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A rat model for focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> using an intraluminal filament method was utilized because <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> is sometimes observed as a result of vascular damage caused by the filament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant increases in the serum S100B levels of rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> were observed from 1 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, compared with the levels in rats without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The early increases in serum S100B were not correlated with the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes at 3 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the serum S100B level increases earlier, reflecting the existence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
