<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of secondary infarctions (SI) after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess whether SI in single (SSI) or multiple (MSI) vascular territories represent different disease entities, we compared clinical profiles of patients with these patterns of SI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CT/MRI-examinations of 448 patients were reviewed for new infarctions within 28 days after SAH, and categorized into SSI or MSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only patients with adequate follow-up imaging excluding any new infarctions were included for analysis (269 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Procedure-related infarctions were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for patients with SSI or MSI versus patients without SI to analyze differences in demographic characteristics, vascular risk factors, disease-related characteristics and treatment modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients had SSI, 53 MSI and 180 no SI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ORs in MSI-patients were &gt;1.5 times higher compared with ORs in SSI-patients for multiple vascular risk factors [MSI:5.4 (2.3-13) versus SSI:1.2 (0.5-2.8)], poor clinical condition on admission [MSI:4.6 (2.4-8.9) versus SSI:2.4 (1.1-5.2)], initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> [MSI:2.6 (1.3-5.3) versus SSI:1.1 (0.5-2.3)] and large amounts of intraventricular blood [MSI:2.9 (1.4-5.8) versus SSI:1.5 (0.7-3.2)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis ORs remained higher in MSI for presence of multiple vascular risk factors [MSI:1.9 (1.2-2.9) versus SSI:1.1 (0.8-1.7)] and initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> [MSI:3.0 (1.0-8.9) versus SSI:1.6 (0.6-4.0)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that SSI and MSI after SAH are not distinct disease entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MSI was related to the same characteristics as SSI but to a larger extent, specifically to the presence of multiple vascular risk factors, initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo>, larger amounts of intraventricular blood, and poor clinical status on admission </plain></SENT>
