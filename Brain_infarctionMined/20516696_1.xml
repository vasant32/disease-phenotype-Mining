<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study used coronal diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to investigate clinical and radiological findings in patients with small deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective study of consecutively admitted patients with small deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the subcortical area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We divided the patients into two groups as follows: (1) those with isolated lesion (IL) defined as an IL in the parenchyma by coronal DWI (group A), and (2) those with linear lesion (LL), defined as a LL extending to the basal surface on coronal DWI (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 86 patients were included in this study, with 43 patients in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological decline and ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis were observed more frequently in group B than in group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signals showed that white-matter hyperintensity was more severe in group A than in group B (p = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that LL patterns of small deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> may result in a higher rate of neurological decline and ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis than IL patterns </plain></SENT>
