<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound is a procedure commonly used to screen individuals with the major <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> S diseases, Hb SS and Hb S-beta(0), for significant stenoses in the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Flow velocities above 200 cm/s have been shown to identify patients at elevated risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among TCD's limitations is the inability to insonate the distal extracranial, petrous, and cavernous internal carotid artery (ICA) through the standard transtemporal approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We extended the submandibular approach to include infra-siphon portions of the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using the extended submandibular approach to evaluate these portions of the ICA, we identified stenotic lesions in 4 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hb SS disease</z:e> out of a population of 131 children with Hb SS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of the 4 patients had no history of overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-like symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging confirmed the stenotic lesions, and also revealed watershed infarction as well as discrete areas of silent infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 4 children had neuropsychological impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The submandibular approach, when added to a standard transcranial Doppler examination, may increase the sensitivity of this technique to identify important potential sources of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
