<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We reported a 37-year-old man who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> and left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> following neck pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the right superior cerebellar artery (SCA) territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Duplex color-flow imaging detected dissection (double lumen) in the right vertebral artery (VA) at the level of the C4-C6 vertebra (V2 segment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography showed irregular narrowing in the right V2, and occlusion of the right SCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that dissection in the right V2 caused artery-to-artery embolism in the right SCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite administration of anti-thrombotic agents, he recurrently suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serial duplex color-flow imaging echography revealed that the dissection of the right VA gradually became more stenotic and extended to the distal site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Coil-embolization of the right VA by endovascular therapy was performed, and thereafter the dissecting lesion of the right VA was completely occluded and ischemic attacks disappeared </plain></SENT>
