<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It occurs most commonly in the setting of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>; however, its association with cerebral small vessel disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>) in community-based elderly remains to be clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this cross-sectional analysis, we evaluated the association between MA and cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> in total 651 community-based elderly subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> by interviews and physical examinations, including an evaluation of urinary albumin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio (UACR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and carotid ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As endothelial markers, the serum levels of thrombomodulin (TM) and a tissue-type plasminogen activator/ plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 complex were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean TM and UACR were higher in subjects with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> or with moderate white matter hyperintensities (mWMH) on MRI than in those without them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the prevalence of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> or mWMH was higher in the highest tertile of UACR level than in the lowest or middle tertile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in logistic regression analysis, the elevation of logarithmically transformed UACR (log UACR) was associated with the higher likelihood for total lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (odds ratio [OR], 1.85 per one log UACR increase), multiple lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (OR, 1.89 per one log UACR increase), and mWMH (OR, 2.15 per one log UACR increase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present study revealed that levels of urinary albumin are associated with cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>, independently of traditional cerebrovascular risk factors, in community-based elderly </plain></SENT>
