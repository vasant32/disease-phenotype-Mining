<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the possible role of inflammatory reaction and TLR2/4 signaling pathway in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, in the present study, we explored the spatio-temporal distribution of inflammatory reaction, and further investigated the time-course expression of TLR2/4 and the downstream effector molecules after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats underwent permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) for 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficit, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and neutrophil infiltration were measured at different time points following pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of TLR2/4 were examined by immunohistochemistry, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were determined by western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum content of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Experimental results showed that pMCAO caused an increase of neutrophil infiltration in infarcted brain tissue, with a peaked activity at 24 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The inflammatory molecules including TLR2, TLR4, NF-kappaB, COX-2 and TNF-alpha were significantly increased after pMCAO, especially during 12-24 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, which were correlated with pMCAO-induced brain injury and cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our studies suggested that TLR2/4 signaling pathway likely aggravated ischemic brain injury through mediating the inflammatory reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TLR2/4 signaling pathway may be a promising therapeutic target for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> injury </plain></SENT>
