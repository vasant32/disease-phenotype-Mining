<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of variable rates of tissue salvage, we hypothesized that this pattern may fragment over time and may be influenced by vessel patency, mismatch volume, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were recruited with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> studies performed within 48 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mismatch patterns based on diffusion-weighted/perfusion-weighted images were categorized as classical (majority of the diffusion-weighted image within the perfusion-weighted image lesion) or nonclassical (fragmented) patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patterns was assessed with reference to time, vessel patency, mismatch volume, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients (33 classical [49.3%] and 34 nonclassical patterns [50.7%]) were studied within 48 hours (median age, 74.0 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to the nonclassical pattern, the classical pattern had a shorter time to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> (3.4 hours vs 10.4 hours; P=0.004) and a larger mismatch volume (62.0 mL vs 3.5 mL; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The positive predictors for the classical pattern were earlier time, vessel occlusion, superficial core location, and larger mismatch volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The classical mismatch pattern may fragment with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Over 48 hours the classical pattern is seen earlier after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, with higher rates of vessel occlusion and larger mismatch volumes </plain></SENT>
