<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To obtain a pharmacological tool to dissect the mechanisms of ARBs' protective benefits in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we synthesized a novel ARB-derivative, R-147176, which is 6,700 times less potent than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">olmesartan</z:chebi> in AT(1)-binding inhibition and therefore has a minimal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> effect, but retains marked inhibitory effects on <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and advanced glycation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effect of R-147176 (10-30 mg/kg per day), administered orally or intravenously, on brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in transient thread occlusion and photothrombotic models in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The antioxidative and antiinflammatory properties were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>R-147176 significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, without influence on blood pressure, in both models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>R-147176 significantly reduced the numbers of ED-1-positive cells and of TUNEL-positive cells, and protein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi> formation in the damaged brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This ARB derivative, despite its significantly lower AT1 affinity and virtually no <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> effect, ameliorated ischemic cerebral damage through antioxidative and antiinflammatory properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest potential usefulness of R-147176 as a pharmacological tool to investigate the ARBs' protective effect in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and open new therapeutic avenues </plain></SENT>
