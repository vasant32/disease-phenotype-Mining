<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared a Thai series of 56 hospitalized brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patients younger than 50 years (16% of 357 similar patients from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages) with a series of 55 Dutch patients (8% of 694 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Thai patients had 12% (95% confidence interval: 3-21) more often a cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cause, due to a higher frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rhd">rheumatic heart disease</z:e> in the Thai series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percentage of patients with atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cause was higher in the Dutch series, whereas the percentage of those with hematologic abnormalities, or those with vasculopathies did not differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients in the Thai series had 17% (95% confidence interval: 7-27) more often an unidentified <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cause, which was probably related to less extensive ancillary investigations compared with the Dutch series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that especially centers in developing countries that treat young <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients should be supplied with ancillary testing facilities, such as cardiac echo, carotid ultrasound, and some laboratory facilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, could lower the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the young </plain></SENT>
