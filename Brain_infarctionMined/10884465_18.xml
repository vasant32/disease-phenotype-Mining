<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) synthesized by endothelial constitutive NO synthase (ecNOS) plays a key role in vascular regulation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known concerning the role of the ecNOS gene (NOS3) as a risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (BI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate the relation between the Glu298Asp polymorphism in exon 7 of NOS3 with BI and its subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients (n=460; cases) with BI were consecutively recruited and classified into etiological subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control subjects (n=460; controls) without a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were recruited among individuals hospitalized at the same institutions and individually matched on age, sex, and center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genotypes of the polymorphism were determined by polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The distribution of genotypes was significantly different between cases and controls (P=0.008); the GG genotype was more frequent in cases (46.1%) than in controls (35.4%; OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.19 to 2.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among subtypes, the frequency of the GG genotype was significantly higher in cases than in controls in the lacunar subtype (OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.05 to 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>80); in this group, the relation between BI and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> level was stronger among carriers of the GG genotype than among noncarriers (P for interaction, 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Homozygosity for the G allele of the Glu298Asp polymorphism in NOS3 was associated with BI, and especially with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that genetic susceptibility and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> have a synergistic relation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although these findings should be replicated in a larger sample of subjects and the functionality of the Glu298Asp polymorphism has not been established, these results may help us to understand the cause of the arteriolopathy underlying lacunae and have future implications in their treatment and prevention </plain></SENT>
