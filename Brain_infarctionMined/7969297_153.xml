<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic disease of the aortic arch has been suspected to be a potential source of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a study to quantify the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> associated with atherosclerotic disease of the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using transesophageal echocardiography, we performed a prospective case-control study of the frequency and thickness of atherosclerotic plaques in the ascending aorta and proximal arch in 250 consecutive patients admitted to the hospital with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and 250 consecutive controls, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> over the age of 60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Atherosclerotic plaques &gt; or = mm in thickness were found in 14.4 percent of the patients but in only 2 percent of the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for atherosclerotic risk factors, the odds ratio for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> among patients with such plaques was 9.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 3.3 to 25.2; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 78 patients who had brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> with no obvious cause, 28.2 percent had plaques &gt; or = 4 mm in thickness, as compared with 8.1 percent of the 172 patients who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> whose possible or likely causes were known (odds ratio, 4.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.2 to 10.1; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plaques of &gt; or = 4 mm in the aortic arch were not associated with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> or stenosis of the extracranial internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, plaques that were 1 to 3.9 mm thick were frequently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> of &gt; or = 70 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate a strong, independent association between atherosclerotic disease of the aortic arch and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The association was particularly strong with thick plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Atherosclerotic disease of the aortic arch should be regarded as a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and as a possible source of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
