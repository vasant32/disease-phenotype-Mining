<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Elevated plasma total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (tHcy) levels have been associated with increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but it is uncertain whether the mediating mechanisms are predominantly cellular, vascular, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between tHcy levels and findings at brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a community-based sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Our sample comprised 1965 participants in the Framingham Offspring Study (1050 women; mean [SD] age, 62 [9] years) who were free of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, or other neurologic disease affecting brain MRI and for whom at least 1 measurement of plasma tHcy level (1991-2001) and a brain MRI (1999-2002) were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used multivariate regression analysis to relate initial (1991-1995) and concurrent (1998-2001) plasma tHcy levels to total cerebral brain volume and lobar volumes as measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and to the presence or absence of silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and extensive white matter hyperintensity (log-white matter intensity &gt; or =1 SD above the age-adjusted mean) as separate measures of vascular injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean total cerebral brain volume was 78% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At MRI, 218 participants had silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and 250 demonstrated extensive white matter hyperintensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Participants with a plasma tHcy level in the highest age- (-0.37%, P = .01) or sex-specific (-0.48%, P &lt; .001) quartile had smaller total cerebral brain volumes compared with participants with lower tHcy levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Initial tHcy levels were associated with a higher prevalence of silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (relative risk, 1.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.1; P = .02) and concurrent tHcy levels, with smaller frontal (-0.14%, P = .001) and temporal lobar (-0.10%, P = .04) volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of extensive white matter hyperintensity did not differ according to initial or concurrent plasma tHcy levels (relative risk, both 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.7-1.4 and 0.8-1.4, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Higher plasma tHcy levels are associated with smaller brain volume and the presence of silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> at MRI, even in healthy, middle-aged adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, both cellular and vascular mechanisms may underlie the association of plasma tHcy level with brain aging, as reflected by the effects on both subclinical and overt disease </plain></SENT>
