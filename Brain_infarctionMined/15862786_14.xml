<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following brain injury, environmental enrichment, pharmacological and rehabilitative treatments can markedly alter neuronal plasticity and behavioral recovery even when delayed by several weeks after the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">Fluoxetine</z:chebi> has been given to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients to combat <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> but its effects on recovery of function are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional magnetic resonance imaging reveals that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi> alters brain activity and modulates motor performance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients in a use-dependent fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several antidepressants, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi>, increase growth factors and other proteins associated with plasticity, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi> combined with rehabilitation affected recovery of function on 3 separate tests of forelimb reaching, preference and limb coordination after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> was induced in male Long-Evans rats by intracortical and striatal injections of endothelin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">Fluoxetine</z:chebi> (10 mg/kg/day) combined with rehabilitation therapy (6 h/day) for 4 weeks did not alter the degree or rate of recovery of function compared to non-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite the ability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi> to alter brain activity and increase growth factors, it does not appear to be an effective pharmacological adjunct to functional recovery after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
