<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Current studies suggest an interaction between vascular mechanisms and neurodegenerative processes that leads to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested whether AD pathology was associated with white matter hyperintensities (WMH) or cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the oldest old individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Brains from 132 subjects over 85 years old, who came to autopsy from the Vantaa 85+ population-based cohort, were scanned by postmortem MRI and examined for neuropathologic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coronal images were analyzed to determine the degree of frontal and parietal periventricular WMH (PVWMH) and deep WMH (DWMH) and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuropathologic variables included Consortium to Establish a Registry for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> scores for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>neuritic plaques</z:hpo> and Braak staging among subjects in 5 groups: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aging (NA), borderline with insufficient AD pathology, AD, AD plus other pathology, and other primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1285162" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">degenerative diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Frontal DWMH were detected in &gt;50% of the sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both frontal PVWMH and DWMH were significantly more extensive in the AD group compared to the NA group or the NA and borderline groups combined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Frontal PVWMH and DWMH were also associated with increased Braak staging (p = 0.03) and the neuritic plaque load (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further analysis revealed there were a greater number of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> associated with frontal DWMH (p = 0.03) but not with frontal PVWMH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed an association between neurofibrillary pathology and frontal PVWMH and DWMH (rather than parietal), as a surrogate of small vessel disease, particularly in very old community-dwelling individuals </plain></SENT>
