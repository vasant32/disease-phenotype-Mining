<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In approximately one-fourth of cases an underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> can be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the importance of genetic risk factors of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in childhood or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in adulthood as risk factors for ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in children in a multicentre survey focusing on patients with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>38 of 162 white infants and children (neonate-18 years) with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were suffering from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An age-matched group of 100 children from the same geographic areas as the patients served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients and controls were analysed for increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (a) levels &gt; 30 mg/dl, for the presence of the factor V (FV) G1691A mutation, the prothrombin (PT) G20210 A variant, and deficiencies of protein C, protein S, and antithrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The following frequencies (patients vs. controls), odds ratios (OR) and confidence intervals (CI) of single risk factors were found: Lp(a) &gt; 30 mg/dl (18.4% vs. 5%; OR/CI: 4.3/1.3-14.4; p = 0.03), FV G1691A (13.2% vs. 4%; OR/CI 3.63/0.92-14.3; p = 0.12) protein C type I deficiency (15.8% vs. 1%; OR/CI: 18.5/2.15-16.0; p = 0.0017), anticardiolipin antibodies (10.5% vs. 0%; p = 0.0051) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No protein S or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Combinations of haemostatic disorders were found in 10.5% of cases but in none of the controls (Fisher 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: While FV G1691A and prothrombin G20210 A mutations show no significant data in our study, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (a) levels &gt;30 mg/dl <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo>, anticardiolipin antibodies and combined prothrombotic disorders seem to be important risk factors for manifestation of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in children with underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
