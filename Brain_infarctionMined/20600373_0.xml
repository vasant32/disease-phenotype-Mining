<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the cortex and lateral hypothalamus of rats subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO)-reperfusion brain injury were examined by double immunofluorescence staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number of orexin-A-expressing neurons in the non-ischemic side was significantly lower than the ischemic side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Next, orexin-A was administered intracerebroventricularly followed by the induction of MCAO-reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Administration of orexin-A at 0.3nmol significantly reduced the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggested that orexin-A alters the pathological mechanisms involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> and has a neuroprotective effect </plain></SENT>
