<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alzheimer' disease (AD) and cerebral vascular lesions are common in the elderly and represent, with increased age, the most frequent contributors to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is now believed that these pathologies frequently coexist in the same brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The border discriminating vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> from AD is blurred and challenges our understanding of these clinical entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further research, at both basic and clinical levels, is mandatory in order to better understand the interactions of vascular ischemic injury and primary degenerative physiopathologies of the brain, in order to prevent and better manage patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We review recent published clinical evidence of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> as a contributor to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microemboli, from both cardiac and vascular origins, have been shown to be associated with structural changes in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The role of transcranial Doppler as an objective tool for detecting and quantifying microemboli is discussed in light of recent clinical evidence </plain></SENT>
