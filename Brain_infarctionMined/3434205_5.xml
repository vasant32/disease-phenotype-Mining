<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, 8 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> and 20 controls were investigated for lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) <z:chebi fb="3" ids="25375">monoamine</z:chebi> metabolites and cholinesterases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diseased patients were lumbar punctured on 2 occasions, mean Days 1 (0-3) and 5 (3-9) after debut of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="25375">Monoamine</z:chebi> concentrations were determined by reverse phase liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection and the cholinergic enzymes were measured photometrically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased concentrations of 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT), homovanillic acid (HVA), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HI-AA) and increased activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid was found in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> when compared to control values, while the levels of 3-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32772">methoxy</z:chebi>-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) were not altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No change of any neurotransmitter metabolite concentration/enzyme activity were found between Day 1 and Day 5 in the diseased patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest an increased release of these neurotransmitter markers from necrotic brain areas into the cerebrospinal fluid and/or altered barriers between blood, brain and CSF and/or a dysfunction of the arachnoid villi to clear substances from the CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We therefore concluded that CSF <z:chebi fb="65" ids="25512">neurotransmitters</z:chebi> may be useful as specific brain markers in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
