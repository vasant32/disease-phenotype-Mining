<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Long Evans rats underwent common carotid artery/middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (CCA/MCAo) and 24 hr later were randomized to receive saline IV or a bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> followed by an IV infusion of autologous separated MNCs (1 million, 10 million, or 30 million cells/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In another experiment, rats underwent CCAo/MCAo and were randomized at 24 hr, 72 hr, or 7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to receive a saline injection or 10 million/kg MNCs </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in neurological deficits in the 10 and 30 million cell/kg groups at 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Animals treated with MNCs at 72 hr but not at 7 days showed a significant reduction in neurological deficits by 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Labeled MNCs were found in the brain, spleen, lung, liver, and kidney at 1 hr and exponentially decreased over the ensuing week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we found a maximum reduction in neurological deficits at 10 and 30 million cells/kg and a therapeutic time window up to 72 hr after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>. Â© 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc </plain></SENT>
