<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used complete magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) histories from 266 HbSS children, aged 6 through 19 years, who were enrolled in the Cooperative Study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sickle Cell Disease</z:e> (CSSCD) to examine silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> prevalence, localization, recurrence, and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a baseline prevalence of 21.8%, marginally higher than previously reported due to improved imaging technologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although we observed no overall sex difference in prevalence, most lesions in girls occurred before age 6, whereas boys remained at risk until age 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were significantly smaller and less likely to be found in the frontal or parietal cortex than were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Children with silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> had an increased incidence of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (1.03/100 patient-years) and new or more extensive silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (7.06/100 patient-years) relative to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children in our cohort (0.54/100 patient-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both events were substantially less frequent than the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence among children not provided <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> transfusion therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> transfusion is known to decrease occurrence of new silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in children with elevated cerebral arterial blood flow velocity, further study is required to determine its risk-benefit ratio in children with silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> velocities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Until safe and effective preventive strategies against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> recurrence are discovered, MRI studies are best reserved for children with neurologic symptoms, neuropsychometric deficits, or elevated cerebral artery velocities </plain></SENT>
