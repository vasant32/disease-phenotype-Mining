<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarction</z:e> alone were excluded from the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography was performed in 72 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of the mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was made on the basis of cerebral angiographic and echocardiographic (presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> as a potential embolic source) findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Embolism was inferred when the presence of the patent <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> ipsilateral to the infarction, reopening of the occluded <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> or intraluminal filling defect was demonstrated by angiographic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we divided these patients into three groups according to potential source of emboli; cardiogenic, atherothrombotic (so-called artery-to-artery embolism) and embolism of undetermined origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We diagnosed the patient to have thrombotic mechanism, when an occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> was demonstrated without presence of an embolic source (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases</z:e> or stenotic arterial lesions proximal to the occluded <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the mechanism (embolic or thrombotic) could not be clearly distinguished, we categorized them "unclassified" </plain></SENT>
