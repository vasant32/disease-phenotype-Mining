<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the burden of leukoaraiosis and the number of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, defined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are prospectively and independently associated with intraparenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (IPH) incidence in a pooled population-based study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among 4,872 participants initially free of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities Study and the Cardiovascular Health Study, we assessed white matter grade (range, 0-9), reflecting increasing leukoaraiosis, and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> using MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over a median of 13 years of follow-up, 71 incident, spontaneous IPH events occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for other IPH risk factors, the hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) across white matter grades 0 to 1, 2, 3, and 4 to 9 were 1.00, 1.68 (0.86-3.30), 3.52 (1.80-6.89), and 3.96 (1.90-8.27), respectively (p for trend &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These hazard ratios were weakened only modestly (p for trend = 0.0003) with adjustment for MRI-defined brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IPH hazard ratios for 0, 1, 2, or â‰¥3 MRI-defined brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were 1.00, 1.97 (1.10-3.54), 2.00 (0.83-4.78), and 3.12 (1.31-7.43) (p for trend = 0.002), but these were substantially attenuated when adjusted for white matter grade (p for trend = 0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Greater MRI-defined burden of leukoaraiosis is a risk factor for spontaneous IPH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous IPH should be added to the growing list of potential poor outcomes in people with leukoaraiosis </plain></SENT>
