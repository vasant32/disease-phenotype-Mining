<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to recognize patterns of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> perfusion abnormalities in this presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: One thousand eight hundred fifty <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging studies performed for the suspicion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> were analyzed retrospectively to detect patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> migrainous aura not from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were examined clinically by 2 neurologists and underwent a standard <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging protocol, including PWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two radiologists reviewed the perfusion maps visually and quantitatively for the presence, distribution, and grade of perfusion abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 1850 MR imaging studies, 20 (1.08%) patients were found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> migrainous aura </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hypoperfusion was found in 14/20 patients (70%) with delayed rMTT and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>, decreased rCBF, and minimal decrease in rCBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the typical pattern in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, perfusion abnormalities were not limited to a single vascular territory but extended to &gt;1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bilateral hypoperfusion was seen in 3/14 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 11/14 cases, hypoperfusion with a posterior predominance was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> and rMTT were the best maps to depict perfusion changes at visual assessment, but also rCBF maps demonstrated significant hypoperfusion in quantitative analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, clinical and imaging follow-up findings were negative for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> migrainous aura is rare but important in the differential diagnosis among patients with the suspicion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> perfusion abnormalities can be seen in these patients </plain></SENT>
