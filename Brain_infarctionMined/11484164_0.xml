<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze the hereditary susceptibility for HLA-DQA1 alleles according to trait of multiple genes leading to disease in atherothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (ABI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: HLA-DQA1 alleles in ABI patients (n=81) and healthy controls (n=99) were detected by PCR-SSP techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1)The frequency of HLA-DQA1*0301 was significantly higher in ABI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(2)The frequency of HLA-DQA1*0301 was significantly higher in patients with family history of essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (EH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(3)The frequency of HLA-DQA1*0103 was significantly lower in ABI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HLA-DQA1*0301 allele might be a correlative gene with hereditary susceptibility of ABI and HLA-DQA1*0301 allele might be a correlative gene in ABI patients with the family history of essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, whereas HLA-DQA1*0103 allele might be a protective gene in the patients with ABI </plain></SENT>
