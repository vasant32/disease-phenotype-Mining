Symptomatic dissecting aneurysms of the extracranial internal carotid artery after blunt trauma are not frequent. Medical treatment of these lesions can be ineffective and surgical options present high morbidity. We describe a case successfully treated with endovascular therapy, using a self-expanding stent. The advantages of the endovascular treatment are outlined, the literature on carotid artery injuries by blunt trauma and management strategies are reviewed.
