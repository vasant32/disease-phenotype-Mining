We report an extremely rare case of multi-vessel dissection including left carotid artery, ascending aorta and thoracoabdominal aorta independently. A 65-year-old man suffered from cerebral infarction due to left carotid artery dissection. Five days later, he complained of severe back pain and was diagnosed as acute DeBakey type IIIb aortic dissection. He had been treated medically. One month later, computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated DeBakey type II as well as type IIIb aortic dissections. The ascending aorta was replaced on August 8, 2001. Then replacement of the descending thoracic aorta with reconstruction of the eighth and tenth intercostal arteries was performed on September 26, 2001. The left carotid artery dissection has been treated medically.
