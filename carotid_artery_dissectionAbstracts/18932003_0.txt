We present the case of a 40-year-old female patient with sudden onset of anisocoria and unilateral ptosis of the left eye. With the exception of several previous episodes of nausea and vomiting, mild headache and tiredness, combined with the early death of the patient's mother following aortic rupture, patient history and clinical condition showed no pathological findings. Following indicative findings on duplex sonography, a dissection of the left internal carotid artery from its origin to its distal section was detected on CT angiography of the brain vessels and the diagnosis of Horner syndrome due to internal carotid artery dissection was made. Since this condition is associated with serious embolic complications, prompt treatment following diagnosis is of utmost importance. Our patient was treated conservatively using PTT (partial thromboplastin time)-effective heparinisation. Regular checks including kidney ultrasound, blood pressure measurement, imaging and continuous therapy with acetylsalicylic acid are recommended.
