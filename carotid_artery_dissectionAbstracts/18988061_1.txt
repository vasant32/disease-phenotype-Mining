With the advent of improved neuroradiological methods, it has been determined that frequency of traumatic carotid artery dissections is higher than previously observed. Since delayed neurological deficits may develop in some asymptomatic undiagnosed cases, it is essential to consider the possibility of the carotid artery dissection and evaluate it properly in suspicious cases. In this article, a case of internal carotid artery dissection and subsequent cerebral infarction following a motor vehicle accident is presented. Pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnostic method choices and treatments in this rare but severe condition are discussed in light of the relevant literature in order to convey current knowledge.
