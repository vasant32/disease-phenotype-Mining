Extracranial carotid artery dissection may manifest as arterial stenosis or occlusion, or as dissecting aneurysm formation. Anticoagulation and/or antiplatelet therapy is the first-line treatment, but because it is effective and less invasive than other procedures, endovascular treatment of carotid artery dissection has recently attracted interest. We encountered two consecutive cases of trauma-related extracranial internal carotid artery dissection, one in the suprabulbar portion and one in the subpetrosal portion. We managed the patient with suprabulbar dissection using a self-expandable metallic stent and managed the patient with subpetrosal dissection using a balloon-expandable metallic stent. In both patients the dissecting aneurysm disappeared, and at follow-up improved luminal patency was observed.
