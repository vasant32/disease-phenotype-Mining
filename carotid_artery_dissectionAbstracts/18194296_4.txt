We describe 2 patients with cluster headache attacks associated with a dissection of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery at the extra-intracranial passage. These cases highlight the need for extensive neuroradiological investigation in cluster headache patients when atypical features are present. We also performed a PubMed search to review the current literature data about this association.
