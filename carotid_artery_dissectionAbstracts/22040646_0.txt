CLINICAL CASE: A 42-year-old man presented with ptosis and miosis in his left eye and a history of headache over the last 20 days. An angioresonance showed dissection of internal carotid artery. DISCUSSION: "Painful Horner's Syndrome" is considered to be a medical emergency due possible onset of an internal carotid artery dissection. We consider that awareness of neuro-ophthalmologic emergencies is very important in the clinical praxis of an ophthalmologist. Multidisciplinary treatment and follow-up of these patients is required.
