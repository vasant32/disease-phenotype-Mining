Dissection of the internal carotid artery is an important cause of ischemic stroke in children and young patients. Trauma and/or an underlying structural defect of the arterial wall have been suggested to be predisposing factors. The typical patient presents with ipsilateral headache or neck pain, ipsilateral Horner's syndrome and delayed ischemic symptoms. Diagnosis is given by ultrasound, transcranial Doppler, magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography and conventional angiography. Treatment of this type of injury includes anticoagulation therapy, antiplatelet therapy and surgery. We report a 14-year-old boy with internal carotid artery dissection who presented with ischemic stroke.
