PURPOSE: To report a case of post-traumatic internal carotid artery dissection and pseudoaneurysm formation at the C-1 level successfully treated by a percutaneous endovascular technique. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 20-year-old female presented 72 hours after a motor vehicle accident with incomplete occulosympathetic paresis (Horner's syndrome), carotidynia, and leftsided 1.5-cm x 2.5-cm pseudoaneurysm at the C-1 level. Neuroradiologists embolized the pseudoaneurysm with Guglielmi detachable coils and controlled the dissection with placement of a Wallstent. CONCLUSIONS: This report illustrates successful percutaneous endovascular treatment of a carotid dissection and pseudoaneurysm near the base of the skull.
