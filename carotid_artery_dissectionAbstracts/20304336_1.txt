Intracranial carotid dissection is an underrecognized cause of childhood stroke, and, in the face of limited therapeutic experience, its management is controversial. Reported here is the case of a 12-year-old girl who experienced an intracranial carotid artery dissection with progressive and symptomatic occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Endovascular treatment with intra-arterial thrombolysis and stent reconstruction was successfully performed to recanalize the occluded arterial segment. Current management of intracranial carotid dissection in children is reviewed, with discussion of the reasons for aggressive endovascular intervention.
