PURPOSE: To report two cases of head or neck pain and central retinal artery occlusion associated with spontaneous dissection of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery. METHODS: Case reports. RESULTS: We describe two cases of sudden visual loss caused by central retinal artery occlusion. Both cases were preceded by ipsilateral headaches or neck pain and tinnitus. The patient had no other neurological signs or history of trauma. In both cases, cerebral angiography revealed ipsilateral internal carotid artery dissection. CONCLUSION: Ipsilateral headache or neck pain with tinnitus preceding central retinal artery occlusion is highly suggestive of internal carotid artery dissection. Early diagnosis and treatment may reduce the risk of hemispheric stroke.
