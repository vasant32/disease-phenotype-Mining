A 64-year-old male presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Angiography showed a dissecting aneurysm of the right vertebral artery (VA), and severe stenosis of the right internal carotid artery (ICA). He was treated conservatively in the early stage. Repeat angiography showed enlargement of the dissecting aneurysm of the VA and partial resolution of the stenosis of the right ICA. Intraaneurysmal coil embolization with proximal coil occlusion was performed following a balloon occlusion test. The postoperative course was uneventful. Based on the neuroradiological findings, the stenotic lesion of the right ICA was considered to be due to dissection. Analysis of serial changes in dissecting lesions in the craniocervical arteries is important for the correct choice of treatment, especially in patients with multi-vessel dissections. The surgical options should be determined on an individual basis.
