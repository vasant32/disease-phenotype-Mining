A 50-year-old woman presented a sudden left occipital headache and a posterior circulation stroke after cervical manipulation for neck pain. Magnetic resonance imaging documented a left intracranial vertebral artery occlusive dissection associated with an ipsilateral internal carotid artery dissection with vessel stenosis in its prepetrous tract. This is the first reported case showing an associate vertebral and carotid artery dissection following cervical manipulation. Carotid dissection was asymptomatic and, therefore, its incidence may be underestimated. We emphasize that cervical manipulation should be performed only in patients without predisposing factors for artery dissection and after an appropriate diagnosis of neck pain.
