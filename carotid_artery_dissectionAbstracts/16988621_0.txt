INTRODUCTION: We report a case of a 66-year-old woman presenting a central retinal artery occlusion with no cardiovascular risk factor, with assessment using supra-aortic artery ultrasonography showing total internal carotid artery thrombosis. OBSERVATION: When vascular thrombosis risk factors are absent, more in-depth assessment such as a supra-aortic artery angioscan can provide the diagnosis of arterial dissection on arterial fibromuscular dysplasia. CONCLUSION: Central retinal artery occlusion is a rare but severe pathology. Therefore it is very important not to neglect the etiological assessment, because it can be the revealing element of a severe pathology.
