The results of an autopsy of a 78-year-old female patient with an occluded of the right internal carotid artery after a traffic accident are reported. She presented with consciousness disturbance, right conjugate deviation, left hemiparesis and left pathological reflex. Evidence of right skull and clavicular fractures seemed to suggest that severe hyperextension of her neck associated with contralateral lateral flexion had stretched her carotid artery. Although she was treated with antiplatelet therapy, her cerebral swelling due to right global infarction progressed and she died due to bilateral cerebral herniation three days after injury. The autopsy disclosed right dissecting carotid artery occlusion and subadventitial dissection was revealed histologically. When a hematoma dissect the media and adventitia of the carotid artery wall, the outer wall weakens and may dilate without narrowing the lumen of the carotid artery. In this case, the vessel occlusion was considered to be due to a primary intramural hematoma which developed and subsequently ruptured through the intima into the vessel lumen. Early diagnosis and treatment are necessary for improving the prognosis of this disease entity. A patient with poor colateral flow, such as in this case, will show a rapid progression of cerebral infarction. It is best to consider surgical treatment in this case if the other traumatic lesions are able to tolerate surgery.
