PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of emergent carotid stenting for an acute internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection. CASE REPORT: A 51-year-old man was admitted to our emergency department's stroke unit 1 hour after the onset of left hemiparesis. Computed tomographic and transcranial Doppler scans showed no pathological findings, but the color Doppler study detected a double lumen in the right carotid bifurcation extending to the proximal ICA. Within the first 2 hours after admission, the patient's neurological status began to fluctuate; the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and Rankin scores evaluated each hour after admission ranged from 0 to 12 and from 0 to 3, respectively. Emergency carotid angiography confirmed the dissection of the bulb and proximal right ICA, which prompted implantation of 2 Wallstents from the internal to common carotid artery. Forty-eight hours later, the patient was almost totally asymptomatic with an NIHSS score of 1 and a Rankin score of 0; he was discharged on postoperative day 3. At 3 months, the patient was free of neurological symptoms and the stented carotid artery was patent. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with fluctuating neurological signs and symptoms consistent with carotid artery dissection that are refractory to medical therapy, a stent can be placed to prevent permanent neurological deficits provided that the anatomical conditions are suitable.
