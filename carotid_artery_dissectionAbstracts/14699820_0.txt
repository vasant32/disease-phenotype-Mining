Carotid artery dissection carries significant morbidity and mortality if not detected early. Carotid artery dissections can produce lesions on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) that may be confused with the characteristic findings in Multiple Sclerosis. We present a case of carotid artery dissection presenting with signs, symptoms, and MRI findings consistent with Multiple Sclerosis.
