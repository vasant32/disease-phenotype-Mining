Dissection of the internal carotid artery is becoming more frequently recognized as a cause of neurological deficits or stoke in younger adults. A dissection is diagnosed in relation to minor often primarily unrecognized trauma to the neck and the typical clinical features seen with dissection are headache, Horner's syndrome and symptoms of focal brain ischaemia. Treatment, i.e. anti-coagulant therapy, is initiated to avoid thrombosis or recurrent embolism from the damaged arterial wall. The prognosis is generally good. The diagnosis of carotid dissection can be confirmed with ultrasound-duplex-scanning, conventional angiography or magnetic resonance imaging/angiography. In this paper two cases are reported in which computed tomography (CT-scanning) with intravenous contrast enhancement has been a valuable diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of this entity.
