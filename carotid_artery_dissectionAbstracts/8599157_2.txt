A-46-year-old woman with a prior history of a spontaneously resolving right central retinal artery occlusion presented with an acute right third order Horner's syndrome and vague ocular pain. Magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated a right internal carotid artery dissection. The dissection improved on anticoagulation therapy. Marfans syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome was suspected but ruled out by clinical criteria and skin biopsy respectively.
