The baroreflex maintains blood pressure through the glossopharyngeal (IX) cranial nerve. We report a 54-year-old man who developed a left sided headache, hoarseness, dysarthria, dysphagia, and sustained hypertension from a left internal carotid artery dissection. We hypothesise that interruption of the left IX nerve caused hypertension in this patient.
