In two young patients with traumatic internal carotid artery dissection, early transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) primarily indicated the lesion. A subsequent carotid angiogram confirmed the diagnosis. The course of the disease was followed by daily TCD recordings and repeated SPECT measurements. Beside CT and angiography, TCD and SPECT are helpful guidelines for different therapeutic approaches aiming to reduce cerebral ischaemia and infarction.
