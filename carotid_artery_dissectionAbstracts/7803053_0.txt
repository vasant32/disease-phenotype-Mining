Internal carotid artery dissection at the cervical level is a known cause of stroke in young patients. The usual clinical presentation is strong ipsilateral cephalea and oculosympathetic paresis or ischemic symptoms in the affected artery. Paresis of the lower cranial nerves due to local compression in the space behind the parotid is rarely found and may complicate the diagnosis by leading physicians to look for anomalies in the vertebro-basilar territory. We present a patient with internal carotid artery dissection at the cervical level diagnosed by angiography. Symptoms at presentation were hemicranial cephalea accompanied by Villaret's syndrome. We point out the importance of keeping this diagnostic possibility in mind when looking for the etiology of subacute paresis of the lower cranial nerves.
