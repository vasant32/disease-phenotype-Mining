PURPOSE/METHODS: A 47-year-old man with a postganglionic Horner's syndrome and severe right facial pain was found to have a normal carotid angiogram. We obtained a magnetic resonance angiogram of the neck because of our continued clinical suspicion of dissection. RESULT/CONCLUSION: An area of hyperintensity was identified along the lumen of the right internal carotid artery, suggesting a subadventitial dissection. Magnetic resonance angiography is a noninvasive, sensitive technique for identifying some carotid dissections.
