The authors reviewed the histories of 33 patients (ages 44 to 50 years) treated with IV thrombolysis for acute stroke due to spontaneous cervical carotid artery dissection. Median NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on admission was 15. No new or worsened local signs, subarachnoid hemorrhage, pseudoaneurysm formation, or rupture of the cervical ICA were observed. At 3 months, median NIHSS was 7 and median modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 2.5; mRS < or = 2 was observed in 17 patients.
