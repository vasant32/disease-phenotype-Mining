In this study, clinical, MRI, and ultrasound findings in 33 patients with 37 MRI-confirmed internal carotid artery dissections (ICADs) were investigated. In 24 of 37 (64.9%) diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) revealed acute ischemic brain lesions. ICADs with subsequent DWI lesions usually had a concentric position of the mural hematoma (14 of 24; 58.3%). In contrast, ICADs without DWI lesions (13 of 37; 35.1%) demonstrated an eccentric position of the mural hematoma (10 of 13; 76.9%), sometimes without ultrasound abnormality (5 of 13; 38.5%), while nonischemic clinical signs were frequent (11 of 13; 84.6%). A hemodynamic stroke pattern with comparatively large ischemic lesions along the hemodynamic risk zones was noted in 7 of 24 patients (29.2%).
