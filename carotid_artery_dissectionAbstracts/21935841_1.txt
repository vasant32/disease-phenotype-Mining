Soccer, one of the most popular sports worldwide among young men, can result in a wide range of orthopedic injuries. Although vascular injuries such as dissection occur rarely, they can cause significant mortality if left undiagnosed. We report herein a 31-year-old male who suffered a large middle cerebral artery infarction due to traumatic internal carotid artery dissection after a ball struck his head and neck. He recovered with mild neurologic deficit after decompressive surgery.
