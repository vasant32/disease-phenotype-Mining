Dissection of the left internal carotid artery apparently occurred in a 38-year-old man when he bent over to wash his feet in the shower. Narrowing was demonstrated on a left internal carotid arteriogram. He was treated conservatively, with prophylactic anticoagulation, antihypertensive drug therapy, and weight reduction. He returned to full activity, and after four months the caliber of the narrowed segment was seen to be almost normal on arteriography.
