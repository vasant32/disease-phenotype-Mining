Management of patients with trauma to the central nervous system is a challenge for the neuroscience nurse. When trauma to the carotid artery is present, the management of closed head injury becomes even more complex.

This article discusses the mechanism of injury, associated symptoms, and theories of management for victims of carotid artery injury associated with blunt craniocervical trauma. New assessment considerations for nursing diagnosis and intervention are provided.
