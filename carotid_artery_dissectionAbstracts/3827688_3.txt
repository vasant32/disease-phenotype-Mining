Facial numbness and dysesthesia have not been emphasized as presenting features in spontaneous internal carotid artery dissection. Progressive facial pain, accompanied by oculosympathetic paresis, altered taste, and facial numbness suggest the possibility of basal skull neoplasm. We describe a patient, with previously undiscovered fibromuscular dysplasia, who presented with severe neck and face pain, dysgeusia, oculosympathetic paresis, and markedly reduced facial sensation due to a spontaneous vascular dissection. Altered facial sensation should now be included in the symptomatology of internal carotid artery dissection.
