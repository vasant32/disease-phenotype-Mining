PURPOSE: Carotid dissection is an important cause of cerebral and retinal ischemic symptoms, especially in young adults. This article presents a patient material and also includes a review of the ophthalmologic signs and symptoms of carotid dissection. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with spontaneous dissection of the extracranial internal carotid artery dissection underwent a neuro-ophthalmological examination. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients had oculosympathetic paresis. Two experienced transient monocular blindness; in one the episodes were provoked by sitting up from a supine position. One patient presented with a monocular visual field defect, due to posterior ischemic neuropathy, and two others with homonym hemianopia. Diplopia, caused by an incomplete VIth cranial nerve palsy was recognised in one. CONCLUSION: All but one patient presented with detectable ophthalmologic symptoms or signs. Very often the ophthalmologist is the first medical contact for patients with internal carotid artery dissection. The condition is serious, and a prompt evaluation and treatment is indicated to prevent irreversible sequelae.
