Internal carotid artery dissection (ICAD) is a condition involving separation of the artery's intimal lining from its medial division, with subsequent extension of the dissection along varying distances of the artery, usually in the direction of blood flow. ICAD may produce cerebral ischemia due to occlusion of the involved artery. This occlusion may occur at or near the site of the dissection, or "downstream" as a result of embolization from a dislodged thrombus fragment. The problem any chiropractic physician faces in identifying ICAD patients is that the condition may present without any symptoms or the symptoms may appear benign (e.g., headache, neck pain or cervicogenic dizziness). Consequently, it may be impossible to identify some ICAD patients, especially in the early stages of the pathology. As the ICAD progresses and neural blood flow is compromised, the symptom picture typically manifests more completely. The chiropractic physician must be alert to characteristic findings of a progressing ICAD, since an immediate referral to a medical specialist may be required.
