A previously healthy 61-year-old male presented to eye casualty with a left-sided Horner's syndrome. He reported that while offering strong vocal support at a football match 5 days previously, he had suddenly noticed an unusual sensation behind his left eye, accompanied by a left hemifacial headache. He had noted pupillary asymmetry soon after this. Radiological imaging revealed a left internal carotid artery dissection. Anticoagulant therapy was commenced, and all symptoms and signs had fully resolved at 1-month follow-up, with no further complications.
