Carotid artery dissection is not uncommon and usually starts at the internal carotid artery. It rarely begins in the common carotid artery. It may cause symptoms of cerebral vascular insufficiency such as stroke and transient ischemic attacks. The case reported here is a 38-year-old man with an acute onset of left hemiparesis 2 hours after drinking three bottles of beer. Computed tomographic scan showed cerebral infarction in the territory of the right middle and anterior cerebral arteries. Ultrasonic imagings showed an intimal flap, starting at the bifurcation of the right common carotid artery, indicative of arterial dissection. Angiography confirmed the diagnosis and the arterial dissection appeared to extend into and terminate at the internal carotid artery.
