PURPOSE: To describe the atypical localization and unusual clinical manifestation of an internal carotid artery dissection. METHODS: We examined a 43-year-old woman who had sudden onset of left ptosis and miosis with vague dysesthesia around her eye. RESULTS: Her examination showed an intrapetrous carotid artery dissection. CONCLUSIONS: The intrapetrous segment is an extremely rare localization for an internal carotid artery dissection. The differential diagnosis of acute Horner syndrome should include carotid dissection, which is usually accompanied by other neurologic manifestations.
