Spontaneous bilateral internal carotid artery dissection has frequently been described in the literature as a cause of stroke. In more than half of the patients with internal carotid artery dissection, recanalization occurs early after the event and is unusual later than 6 months after onset of the dissection. We describe a patient with ischemic stroke due to left internal carotid artery occlusion in the extracranial segment. The patient was treated with anticoagulants and early vessel recanalization did not occur. Ten months later, he developed contralateral internal carotid occlusion in the intracranial tract, which was followed by early complete recanalization. Anticoagulation therapy was continued and, 16 months after the initial event, the left internal carotid artery unexpectedly also reopened.
