Endovascular treatment of carotid cavernous fistulas (CCFs) presents many technical difficulties and hazards, some unique to each patient. This report details some of the difficulties encountered in the treatment of a 63-year-old patient with a CCF and an ipsilateral internal carotid artery dissection. After failure of conventional techniques using a detachable balloon, complete closure of the CCF was achieved by transvenous coil embolization while the arterial lumen was protected by a nondetachable balloon catheter.
