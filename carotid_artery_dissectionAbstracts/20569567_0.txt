Summary: We report a case of bilateral common carotid artery dissection due to strangulation successfully treated by stent placement, with a review of the literature. A 61-year-old woman was strangled by an apron strap. She was admitted to our hospital with tetraparesis, because of spinal cord injury. On the next day, her left hemiparesis aggravated and left facial palsy newly appeared. Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed new ischemic lesions in the right cerebral hemisphere. Aortography revealed bilateral common carotid artery dissection. Moreover, thrombus or intimal flap was recognized in the right common carotid artery. The right common carotid dissection was fixed with deployment of self expanding stents to prevent the aggravation of ischemic stroke at that time. The contralateral lesion was also treated ten days later because small ischemic lesions were newly recognized in the left hemisphere on MRI. No new neurological deficit appeared after bilateral carotid artery stenting. Her paraparesis completely improved two months after the spinal cord injury. Carotid artery stenting using self expanding stents was especially effective as the treatment for bilateral carotid artery dissection.
