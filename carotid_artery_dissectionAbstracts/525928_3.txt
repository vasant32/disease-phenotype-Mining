The functional response to occlusion of arteries supplying the head has been found to be much less severe in th dog than in man, indicating that a more significant collateral development occurs in the dog. To document the anatomic response to chronic occlusion of vessels supplying the head, patterns of collateral vessel growth and development were studied by corrosion casting in adult mongrel dogs 8 weeks after bilateral ligation of the common carotid artery. Dissection of the casts revealed two consistent and bilateral anastomotic connections: (i) internal carotid artery to maxillary artery (anastomotic artery) and (ii) internal carotid artery to ascending pharyngeal artery. Also present in all of the casts was a connection between one common carotid artery and both vertebral arteries, which has been designated as the deep collateral vessel. Significant collateral connections did not occur between the orbital vessels or between analogous vessels of the right and the left sides.
