Headache is usually the first and the most frequent symptom of cervicocephalic arterial dissection. Besides headache ipsilateral Horner's syndrome, cranial nerve palsies, or pulsatile tinnitus are observed. Serious complications of arterial dissection are ischemic strokes, which mostly occur later in the course of time. We report on a patient with spontaneous bilateral carotid artery dissection, who suffered from atypically prolonged, severe, and refractory headache. High-dose administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as well as opioids were ineffective. Pain relief was only achieved after a 3-day course of corticosteroids (100 mg methylprednisolone/day).
