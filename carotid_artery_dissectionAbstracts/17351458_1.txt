A 3-year-old boy was brought to our hospital with 62% TBSA burn injury by boiled water. He received modern burn therapy, including early d√©bridment and skin grafts. The patient discharged 70 days after being burned. Unfortunately, he sustained an acute right-sided hemiparesis 7 days after discharge. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed left middle cerebral artery territory infarction, and a magnetic resonance angiogram showed nonvisualization of left distal intra-cranial carotid artery and proximal middle cerebral artery. Thickened walls of these arteries indicated acute dissection. The patient received a follow-up magnetic resonance angiogram study 10 years later to check cerebral vascular lesions that may not have been apparent on the original image studies. It showed only persistently thickened left distal intra-cranial carotid artery and middle cerebral artery walls, indicative of old dissection. Therefore, carotid artery dissection must be considered as one cause of acute stroke in pediatric burn patient, even in the recovery phase of burn injury.
