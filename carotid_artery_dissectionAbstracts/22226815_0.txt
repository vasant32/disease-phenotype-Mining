In the presence of associated subarachnoid hemorrhage, the treatment of arterial dissection can be classified as either deconstructive (involving occlusion or sacrifice of the parent vessel) or reconstructive (preserving blood-flow through the parent vessel). In both treatment strategies, the main goal is to prevent any further risk of rebleeding. However, reconstructive treatment is reserved only for those patients in whom occlusion of the parent vessel is not feasible due to an insufficient collateral supply. This report is of a case of intra-cranial carotid artery dissection treated by a reconstructive endovascular approach, with deployment of a flow-diverter stent, for the management of an associated subarachnoid hemorrhage. This is, to the authors' knowledge, the first report of the use of a flow-diverter device as the main treatment of a ruptured supraclinoid carotid artery dissection.
