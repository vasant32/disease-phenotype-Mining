 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate quiet standing balance of patients with Wallenberg syndrome before and after rehabilitation. METHOD: Six patients with Wallenberg syndrome were enrolled within one month after being affected by an infarct of the lateral medulla. Quiet standing balance was assessed using posturography with eyes open and closed. The assessment was repeated after the patients had undergone rehabilitation treatment for three to nine months, and the results of the two assessments were compared. RESULTS: The quiet standing balance evaluation was performed by measurement of center of pressure (CoP) movement. In the initial test, the mean scores of mediolateral and anteroposterior speed, velocity movement, mediolateral and anteroposterior extent of CoP were all high, indicating impairments of quiet standing balance in the patients. After rehabilitation treatment, the anteroposterior speed and extent, the mediolateral speed and extent, and velocity moment of CoP showed statistically significant reductions in the eyes open condition (p<0.05), and the anteroposterior speed and extent and velocity moment of CoP had decreased in the eyes closed condition (p<0.05). Mediolateral speed and extent of CoP in the eyes closed condition had also decreased, but the reduction was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated improvements of quiet standing balance, especially anteroposterior balance, in patients with Wallenberg syndrome following rehabilitation. We suggest that balance training is important in the rehabilitation of Wallenberg syndrome and that, as an objective measure of balance status, posturography is useful in the assessment of quiet standing balance.
