Fifty patients with cervical dorsopathy with the vertebral artery syndrome were studied using clinical scales (neurological deficit, psychoemotional disturbances) and laboratory methods (parameters of oxidant stress). The correlations between the oxidant stress and the dynamics of neurological syndromes and psychoemotional disturbances as well as the efficacy and safety of their treatment with antioxidants (mexiprim) were determined.
