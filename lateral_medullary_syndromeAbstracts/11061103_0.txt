During the acute stage of a Wallenberg's syndrome ipsilateral appendicular dysmetria is frequently seen. The dysmetria is more apparent in the ipsilateral upper extremity. These patients also have a peculiar type of dysmetric eye movements that are characterized by hypermetric saccades toward the side of the lesion and hypometric saccades to the opposite side. We examined four patients with acute Wallenberg's syndrome and found horizontal dysmetria of the affected extremity. Hypermetric arm and hand movements were present to the side of the lesion and hypometric movements toward the opposite side. This type of dysmetria is probably related to the same patophysiological mechanism that underlies dysmetric eye movements in the Wallenberg's syndrome. The dysmetria tends to disappear with time although it continues to be present in some patients six months after the ischemic damage.
