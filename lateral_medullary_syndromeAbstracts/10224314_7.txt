Sensory deficits on the contralateral face in Wallenberg's lateral medullary syndrome (WS) may be due to an involvement of the crossing contralateral trigeminothalamic tract. Alternatively, neurons within the medullary dorsal horn (MDH) get input from the contralateral face. MDH neurons supplying the supraorbital nerve area in rat were recorded by electrophysiological techniques. In this first study on contralateral projections, about 60% of the neurons received excitatory afferent input from the contralateral face as well as the ipsilateral supraorbital area. Thus, contralateral sensory deficits in WS may be due to an involvement of these neurons.
