A 59-year-old female was admitted with complaints of vertigo, dysarthria and dysphagia. On neurological examination, right-sided cranial nerve signs included ptosis, Bruns's nystagmus, decreased corneal sensation, diminished facial pain and temperature sensation, decreased palatal excursion and loss of gag reflex. There was no evident motor weakness, but deep tendon reflexes were slightly exaggerated on the left extremities. Coordination testing showed right cerebellar signs. Sensory examination of the remaining parts of the body was quite normal. X-ray CT scan showed multiple high density areas in the right medulla, right pons, right temporal and frontal lobes. T2 weighted MRI demonstrated these lesions as mixed signal intensity areas with marked low signal intensity rim. There were multiple black dots in the bilateral frontal and temporal lobes, cerebellar hemispheres on T2-weighted images. Carotid and vertebral angiograms showed no abnormality. This is the first report of the cavernous malformation presenting as lateral medullary syndrome.
