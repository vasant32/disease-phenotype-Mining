A 21-year-old female presented with an unusual case of posterior fossa arteriovenous malformation (AVM) associated with ipsilateral persistent primitive trigeminal artery (PPTA), manifesting as intraparenchymal hemorrhage involving both the brain stem and the left cerebellar hemisphere. The presenting symptoms were compatible with Wallenberg's syndrome and Foville's syndrome on the left side. She was initially treated conservatively, and subsequently with transarterial embolization followed by stereotactic radiosurgery. This case combined the rare association of posterior fossa AVM and PPTA, with the clinical presentation of intraparenchymal hemorrhage causing both Wallenberg's syndrome and Foville's syndrome.
