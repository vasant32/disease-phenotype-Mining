Magnetic resonance (MR) images of 20 patients with medullary infarction have been reviewed. All patients were imaged on a 1.5 Tesla high-field scanner (GE, Signa). Clinical diagnoses of these 20 patients were Wallenberg's syndrome (15), cerebellar infarct (3), right hemiparesis (1), and multiple cerebral infarcts (1). Locations of infarct were right lateral (8), right postero-lateral (2), left lateral (5), left postero-lateral (4) and left anterior (1). Associated ipsilateral cerebellar infarcts were observed in six patients. Ipsilateral vertebral artery (VA) occlusions were detected in six patients, and VA aneurysm in two. Thus, MR imaging is a pertinent diagnostic modality for evaluating medullary infarction and associated vascular diseases.
