A 69-year-old woman developed acute pain in the left trigeminal and glossopharyngeal nerve distributions. MR imaging demonstrated a left lateral medullary infarction (LMI) involving the left spinotrigeminal nucleus and tract, nucleus ambiguus, and solitary nucleus. Most patients presenting with trigeminal neuralgia will have disease involving the trigeminal nerve or ganglion or the primary sensory nucleus in the pons. We discuss the unusual finding of LMI associated with concurrent trigeminal and glossopharyngeal neuralgia.
