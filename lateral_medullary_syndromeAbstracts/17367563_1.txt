We report an unusual case of lateral medullary syndrome which presented with symptoms of acute upper airway obstruction mimicking angioneurotic oedema. Although dysphonia and dysphagia are common symptoms of lateral medullary syndrome, we have found no other reports of this condition presenting as stridor. This case highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for central causes of common otolaryngological symptoms in the absence of local signs.
