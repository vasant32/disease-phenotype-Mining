Clinical features of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) territory infarcts were investigated in ten patients, ranging in age from 38 to 76 years. In all patients, there were MR images of infarction located in the area supplied by the AICA. The lesion was on the left side in 6 patients and right side in 4. The lesion of brain stem including the middle cerebellar peduncle was found in 7 patients and that extended to the cerebellum was in 3 patients. The main ipsilateral neurological signs were the VII and VIII cranial nerves palsy and cerebellar ataxia. The V and VI cranial nerves palsy. Horner's syndrome, and dysphagia were also present. The main contralateral sign was superficial sensory disturbance, but no hemiplegia. The underlying pathology included chiefly hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Cerebral angiography was performed in 8 patients, most of which was observed severe arteriosclerosis suggesting poor hemodynamics in the vertebral and basilar arteries. The prognosis was relatively good, but the VII, VIII, and V cranial nerves palsy and contralateral superficial sensory disturbance remained as the sequelae. As mentioned above, there were various neurological findings and MR images in AICA territory infarcts. Especially there were some patients whose lesion extended to the upper medulla and neurological findings were similar to the Wallenberg syndrome. It is important that one investigates not only axial slices but also coronal slices of MR image to estimate the extension of AICA territory infarct.
