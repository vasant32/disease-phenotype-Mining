Twenty-seven out of 45 patients who had Wallenberg's syndrome were re-examined as out-patients. Nineteen were complaining of pain on the side opposite to that with loss or temperature and pain sensations or trigeminal deficit. The follow-up showed that pain was both intense and disabling and its treatment was disappointing. The most striking finding was the high frequency of painful sequelae to Wallenberg's syndrome, since they affected almost one out of two patients. The occurrence of these painful symptoms, usually after lesion of the spinothalamic tract, is difficult to explain.
