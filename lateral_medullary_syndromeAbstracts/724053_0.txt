The authors report a woman aged 53 years with the main components of the syndrome of Opalski coexisting with signs characteristic of Wallenberg's syndrome. The lacking components of the former syndrome included Horner's syndrome, while nystagmus, diplopia without evident oculomotor nerves, paresis, disturbances of speech and deglutition belonged to the latter syndrome. The clinical pattern and the course of the disease suggested a vasogenic focus in the right submedullary region and inferolateral part of the medulla.
