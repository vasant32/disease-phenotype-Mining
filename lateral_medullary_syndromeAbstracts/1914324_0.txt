Lateral medullary syndrome is known to cause hemiparesis ipsilateral to the medullary lesion. However, it's clinical significance has not been fully evaluated. In this study, we made clinical and angiographic studies in patients with syndrome to elucidate the pathogenesis of ipsilateral hemiparesis. Thirty-four patients with cerebral infarction presenting with this syndrome were studied. Their mean age was 51 years and all the patients were examined within 6 months of their first attack. Diagnosis of ipsilateral hemiparesis was made if subjective feeling of weakness in the upper and lower extremities was associated with increased deep tendon reflexes. Ipsilateral hemiparesis was observed in 38% of all the patients. Cerebral angiography was performed in 26 patients and divided into two groups; group A with ipsilateral hemiparesis (n = 9) and group B without ipsilateral hemiparesis (n = 7). In 56% of patients in group A, angiography showed non-visualization of ipsilateral vertebral artery (VA) and posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). Non-visualization of these two arteries never occurred in the patients of group B. On the other hand, non-visualization of VA alone was observed in 35% of the patients in group B, but it was none in the patients of group A. However, there were no differences in concerning the frequency of non-visualization of PICA alone or non-occlusion at all between both groups. Therefore, the focal ischemia in the region below the pyramidal decussation due to the occlusion of both VA and PICA, regardless of thrombotic or embolic episode, was considered to be responsible for ipsilateral hemiparesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
