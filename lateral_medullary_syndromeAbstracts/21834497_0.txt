We present a case of partial Wallenberg syndrome also called partial lateral medullary syndrome, a hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke of the area fed by the posterior inferior cerebellar artery and the clinical manifestation depends on the extension of the lesion: dorsal-ventral, medial-lateral and rostrocaudal. Five types have been described. Our patient had headache, hoarseness, right upper extremity, right hemithorax and right upper gluteal hypothermalgesia implicating the involvement of the cervical, the thoracic and part of lumbar fibers of the left lateral spinothalamic tract and the ambiguous nucleus; an entity not described before. The imaging done to our patient disclosed the dissection of the left vertebral artery. He was treated with anticoagulation with gradual improvement in his symptoms.
