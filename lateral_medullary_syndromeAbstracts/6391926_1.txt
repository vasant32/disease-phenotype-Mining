In an open study 7 patients with severe insomnia were treated by a series of 10 injections with the delta-sleep-inducing peptide (DSIP). In all but 1 case sleep was normalized for follow-up periods of 3-7 months. The mood and performance during the daytime improved as well. A problem may be a long-standing habit of drug addiction.
