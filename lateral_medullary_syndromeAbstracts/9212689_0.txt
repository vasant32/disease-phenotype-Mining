A 65-year-old man was admitted to our department due to severe dysphagia, dysarthria, and aspiration pneumonia. Dysphagia and dysarthria were caused by lateral medullary infarction (Wallenberg' s syndrome). After the patient recovered from pneumonia, the abnormality of swallowing was assessed by a swallowing provocation test and videofluorography. Two months after the start of swallowing training, a swallowing provocation test showed that the swallowing reflex had improved and videofluorography showed that the magnitude of aspiration to the trachea had decreased. The patient began taking food by mouth. These tests are useful for quantitative assessment of dysphagia and for deciding when to start oral intake in elderly patients.
