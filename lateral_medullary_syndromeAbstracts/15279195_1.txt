We analyzed clinical characteristics of central post-stroke pain (CPSP), constant and burning pain, in 32 patients with Wallenberg syndrome due to infarction. CPSP developed in 44% (14/32) of the patients; 8 in acute stage (within 4 days after the stroke) and 8 in chronic stage(10-120 days after the stroke). Apart from one exceptional case, CPSP was present in the hypalgesic side of face and extremities. In 9 cases of typical type (Currier's distribution of sensory disturbance), CPSP occurred in the ipsilateral face to the lesion during acute stage. Among them, 2 cases developed severe lancinating pain in chronic stage. In 5 cases of ventral type, it occurred in the contralateral extremities during chronic stage. Spino- and trigemino-thalamic tract are injured but medullary reticular formation is intact in Wallenberg syndrome. It is, therefore, considered that CPSP in Wallenberg syndrome is caused by denervation sensitivity of "paleo-reticulothalamic" tract within the reticular formation.
