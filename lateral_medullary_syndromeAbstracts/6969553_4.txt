Quantitative analysis of electro-oculographic recordings of eye movement in response to precise visual and vestibular stimuli makes possible the differentiation of three categories of vestibular syndromes due to pathological changes in three different parts of the visual vestibulo-ocular reflex arc: (1) decreased vestibulo-ocular reflex gain (e.g., decrease in slow component velocity), but normal fast components and visual-vestibular interaction (labyrinth and eighth nerve); (2) normal slow component velocity but abnormal fast components to all stimuli (pontine or medullar reticular formation); and (3) normal slow component velocity to vestibulo-ocular stimulaton but abnormal visual-vestibular interaction as well as normal fast components (visual-motor pathways or cerebellum).
