We have recently encountered a rare case of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) of the vertebral artery (VA) presenting as lateral medullary syndrome. A 39-year-old male was admitted to our hospital due to vertigo, dysarthria and numbness of the left face and the right limbs. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of brain revealed lateral medullary infarction in the territory of the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). The angiography of the VA revealed tubular stenosis of the left extracranial VA and a focal vascular kinking as well as web in the right extracranial VA, confirming the diagnosis of FMD. We present this rare case to emphasize that FMD could be one of the risk factors causing lateral medullary syndrome in young people.
