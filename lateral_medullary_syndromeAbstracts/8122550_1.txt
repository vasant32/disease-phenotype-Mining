We present a case of dissection of the extracranial vertebral artery with prominent occipital pain and elements of the lateral medullary syndrome. Arteriography showed a string and pearl sign. Magnetic resonance imaging allowed visualization of an intramural thrombus associated with a narrow vascular lumen. The distal portion of the diseased artery was ligated and vascular reconstruction using an interposed radial artery graft was performed. Pathological studies confirmed the diagnosis. The diagnostic roles of angiography and magnetic resonance imaging, and therapeutic strategies are discussed.
