The blink reflex was studied in 38 cases with lateral medullary lesions (Wallenberg syndrome). Twenty-one blink reflexes were abnormal. The most common abnormality is an afferent delay in the late reflex on the side of the lesion with a normal early reflex. This abnormality is not pathognomonic of the Wallenberg syndrome. The physiopathogeny is discussed.
