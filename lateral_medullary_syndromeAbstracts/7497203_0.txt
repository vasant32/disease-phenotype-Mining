Wallenberg's Syndrome (WS) is exceptional in childhood. We present a case of a 10 year-old girl with a WS caused by an embolism in the right lateral portion of the medulla secondary to an electrofulguration, but with an unusual progressive outcome, developing clinical signs of medial medullar injury, leading even into a respiratory failure 30 days after admittance. She only became stable after surgical lesion decompression. There was no evidence of vascular malformation, finding only a great oedema. The pathology only showed changes compatible with brain infarction. This case makes again clear the superiority of MRI upon CT-scan to diagnose a WS. We think that the unusual progression of the lesion was due to great medullar oedema found on surgery, involving the brain regional flow.
