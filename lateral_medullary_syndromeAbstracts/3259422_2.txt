Regional cerebellar perfusion was imaged using technetium Tc 99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime and single photon emission computed tomography (HM-PAO-SPECT) in a patient with chronic left lateral medullary syndrome with contralateral weakness due to traumatically induced thrombosis of the left vertebral artery. Despite continued neurologic deficits, x-ray transmission computed tomography was normal. However, HM-PAO-SPECT demonstrated that blood flow to the left cerebellar hemisphere was significantly impaired. This abnormality was still apparent after correction for atrophy as estimated by magnetic resonance imaging. Technetium Tc 99m hexamethyl-propyleneamine oxime and single photon emission computed tomography effectively imaged regional blood flow in the vertebrobasilar circulation and appears to more clearly reflect the nature and extent of the neurologic deficit than either x-ray transmission computed tomography or magnetic resonance scanning.
