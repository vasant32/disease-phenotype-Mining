A 52-year-old male presented with an extremely rare fracture of the occipital condyle involving the jugular foramen with marked medial rostrad displacement of the fragments. He had ipsilateral VII through XII nerves palsies and Wallenberg syndrome. Conservative treatment did not improve the cranial nerve palsies. A high-resolution CT-scan is essential to visualize these fractures.
