Eye movements were measured objectively in a patient with Wallenberg's syndrome during the course of his 2-year recovery period. The patient exhibited a change in fixational and reading eye movement patterns consistent with concurrent reduction in symptoms. The results demonstrate the importance of clinical eye movement recordings in such patients to understand more fully the relationship between the visually related symptoms and the objective oculomotor correlates.
