A 42-year-old man was admitted complaining of the sudden onset of headache, vomiting, vertigo, and gait disturbance. The authors found hemiparesis of his right limbs, right Homer's syndrome, and decreased pain and temperature sensation of his right face and left limbs. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) showed an acute small infarct located on the right side of the lateral lower medulla. This is the first report of Opalski's syndrome with lower medullary infarction detected by DWI.
