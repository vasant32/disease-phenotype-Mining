This report describes a 10-year-old female who presented with poor growth and right hemihypotrophy. She had crossed sensory findings on neurologic examination consistent with a lateral medullary syndrome with no discernible cranial nerve findings, ataxia, or vertigo. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brainstem revealed a large right parapontine epidermoid. The possible relationship between the hemihypotrophy and the epidermoid is discussed.
