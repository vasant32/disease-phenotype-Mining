In a 55-year-old woman, the medial medullary syndrome developed owing to infarction of the left medullary pyramid, ventromedial portion of the inferior olivary nucleus, medial lemniscus, and hypoglossal nerve. The previously reported 14 cases of the medial medullary syndrome are reviewed, and their clinical features and topography of the medullary lesions are discussed. Like the lateral medullary syndrome, the medial medullary syndrome is closely associated with hypertension and atherosclerosis but has a higher incidence of bilateral involvement and a worse prognosis.
