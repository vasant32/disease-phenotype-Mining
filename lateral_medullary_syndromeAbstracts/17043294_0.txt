With the advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology, it is now possible to identify and determine the precise location of medullary infarcts. The lateral part of the medulla is most commonly affected by infarction. Classifications of lateral medullary infarcts are usually based on anatomical data, using rostrocaudal and dorsoventral axes to establish correlations with clinical symptoms. Different subtypes of lateral medullary syndrome, depending on location, shape and size of the infarct, have been described in the literature. We report a rare case of a patient presenting with an unusual clinical picture in relation to an infarct specifically located in the lateral part of the pontomedullary sulcus.
