A 45-year-old man developed severe cough with cervical pain. The patient was unable to hold an upright position. The origin of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery was not enhanced by angiography. MRI showed a high signal intensity string-like structure of the right vertebral artery. In young patients, Wallenberg's syndrome related to mild head trauma has been reported. However, none of the previous studies related to vertebral arterial dissection was induced by severe cough. When cervical pain is present in young patients with severe cough, MRI should be performed to evaluate the possibility of vertebral arterial dissection.
