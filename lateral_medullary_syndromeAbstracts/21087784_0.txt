 INTRODUCTION: Wallenberg's syndrome and ipsilateral paresis due to combined infarction of the lateral medullary and cervical spinal infarction is known as Opalski syndrome. This rarely described syndrome was reported, to our knowledge, with DWI MRI, only once. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 43-year-old man with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease who, after a brief episode of coma, developed Wallenberg syndrome and ipsilateral hemiparesis. Initial diffusion weighted-imaging MRI showed a high-intensity signal involving the lateral medulla oblongata and the spinal cord; but FLAIR MRI sequences showed bilateral high-intensity signals in the lateral medulla oblongata and spinal cord and high-intensity signals in the right and left cerebellar hemisphere in the PICA territories. MRI performed one year later showed an infarction involving the left medullary area and adjacent spinal segments alone. CONCLUSION: This observation illustrates a rare syndrome of lateral medullary infarction, associated with spinal cord infarction related to a possible transient basilar occlusion.
