Three cases with Wallenberg's syndrome were reported, in which CT-scan revealed silent old right temporal infarction, right recent cerebellar haematoma and left calcified parietal subdural haematoma evidenced after 10 years since trauma due to a traffic accident. Although Wallenberg's syndrome constitutes a fully clinical diagnosis, CT-scan does not seem to be justified by the management logical deductions of the medical act; however, it is better to perform it in order to identify a possible associated pathology.
