 PURPOSE: To report a reduction in macular ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness detected with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in patients with homonymous hemianopia following acquired cerebral damage. METHODS: We analyzed case reports of three patients with unilateral posterior cerebral artery (PCA) infarction. Three patients (aged 66, 68, and 71 years) with left homonymous hemianopia due to infarction of the right PCA territory were studied using SD-OCT. The duration of the lesions from the onset ranged from 12 to 36 months. RESULTS: In all of these patients, although optic atrophy and retinal nerve fiber layer defects were not detected on funduscopy, GCC thinning was demonstrated in the hemiretinae corresponding to the affected hemifields. Macular GCC measurements showed the localized defects of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) more clearly than circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer measurements. Total and outer retinal thicknesses were not found to be significantly affected. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that degeneration of RGCs can occur within a few years after PCA infarction.
