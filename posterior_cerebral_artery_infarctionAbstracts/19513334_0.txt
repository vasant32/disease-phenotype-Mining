 BACKGROUND: Acute onset of a sensory alien hand phenomenon has been observed only from a supratentorial lesion involving the non-dominant hand, mostly from a right posterior cerebral artery infarction. A single acute vascular lesion resulting in a dominant hand sensory alien hand syndrome has not been previously documented. CASE REPORT: A 78-year old right-handed woman exhibited right sensory alien hand phenomenon from a left pontine hemorrhage. Disturbance of proprioceptive input and visuospatial perception are likely to play a role in manifesting the sign. CONCLUSIONS: Dominant-hand sensory alien hand phenomenon may occur in an acute setting from a left pontine hemorrhage.
