It has been reported that the tentorial confluence sign and/or hockey stick pattern on static imaging are useful in evaluating posterior cerebral artery (PCA) infarctions. In 16 cases with PCA infarction, the tentorial confluence sign was found in all cases, but a hockey stick pattern was seen in only half of these patients. The abnormal accumulations may be classified into three types. These three types seem to be consistent with the territory of the blood supply from the cortical, temporal, and/or occipital branches of the posterior cerebral artery. Emission computed tomography images may also demonstrate this consistency.
