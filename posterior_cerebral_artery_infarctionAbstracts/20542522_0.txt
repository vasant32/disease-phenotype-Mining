In cases of unilateral posterior cerebral artery (PCA) infarction, abnormal visual perception in the ipsilateral visual field, which is usually believed to be intact, is not met frequently and may confuse doctors during evaluation. Recently, we observed two patients who presented with contralateral hemianopsia accompanied by ipsilateral visual illusions after acute unilateral PCA infarctions. Their visual illusion was characterized by zooming in, macropsia or micropsia. These symptoms appeared to be related to deficits in size constancy. Lesions of both patients commonly involved the ipsilateral forceps major. The consistent presentation observed in these two patients suggests that dominance of size constancy can be located in the left hemisphere in some individuals.
