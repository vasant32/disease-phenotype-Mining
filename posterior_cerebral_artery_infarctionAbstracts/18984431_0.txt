BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of posterior cerebral artery infarction with hemiparesis (PCAH) is limited to case reports with T2-weighted lesions involving the cerebral peduncle. OBJECTIVE: We sought to extend the MR imaging correlate of PCAH. METHODS: The case histories and MR/MR angiography findings of 4 patients with PCAH were examined. RESULTS: Distinct from previously described MR imaging findings with PCAH, diffusion-weighted imaging and/or FLAIR changes were noted in the thalamogeniculate artery (TGA) territory in one patient; in the distribution of the TGA and lateral posterior choroidal artery (PChA) in two patients; and in the TGA and lateral PChA combined with the peduncular perforating arteries of the cerebral peduncle in one patient. CONCLUSION: Diffusion-weighted imaging changes of infarction in the distribution of the TGA alone or combined with lateral PChA involvement with or without cerebral peduncle infarction correlate with PCAH.
