Unilateral asterixis developed in a 56 year old man, 5 months after an infarct in the posterior cerebral artery territory, involving the posterolateral nuclear complex of the thalamus, documented by CT-scan and MRI. Unilateral asterixis in rarely reported in association with thalamic lesions and usually develops as an immediate postictal phenomenon. We discuss possible physiopathological mechanisms explaining the occurrence and the delayed onset of these involuntary movements.
