Peripheral pain and ataxic tremor can appear suddenly following thalamic stroke and can significantly alter a patient's psychological, social, and physical functioning. The present paper reports the case of a 70-year-old Caucasian female who sustained an acute left posterior cerebral artery infarction involving the thalamus and left mesiotemporal regions. She subsequently developed Central Poststroke Pain and ataxic movement of her right arm and hand in addition to a significant right-side claudication. She was treated over 16 weeks (6 weeks of EMG biofeedback and 10 weeks of psychotherapy) with a combination of EMG biofeedback, progressive muscle relaxation, behavioral pain coping skills training, Forced Use Therapy, and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy 7 years after her initial cerebral accident. The case demonstrates the utility of biofeedback when combined as part of a comprehensive treatment program to address the multiple complications associated with thalamic stroke.
