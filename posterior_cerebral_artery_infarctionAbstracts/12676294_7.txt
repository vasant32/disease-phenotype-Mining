Infarction of the posterior cerebral artery may present only with signs of agitated delirium and an acute confusional state. In the absence of other prominent neurological deficits, this can be easily mistaken for toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, head trauma, post-ictal confusion, or a psychiatric disorder. Appropriate head imaging studies are important to detect an illness that might otherwise be missed and left untreated.
