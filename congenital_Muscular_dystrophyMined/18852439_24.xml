<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined two patients belonging to a consanguineous family affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611706" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myosclerosis</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, screened for mutations of collagen VI genes, and performed a detailed biochemical and morphologic analysis of the muscle biopsy and cultured fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients had a novel homozygous nonsense COL6A2 mutation (Q819X); the mutated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> escaped nonsense-mediated decay and was translated into a truncated alpha2(VI) chain, lacking the sole C2 domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The truncated chain associated with the other two chains, giving rise to secreted collagen VI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monomers containing the truncated chain were assembled into dimers, but tetramers were almost absent; secreted collagen VI was quantitatively reduced and structurally abnormal in cultured fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutated collagen did not correctly localize in the basement membrane of muscle fibers and was absent in the capillary wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural analysis of muscle showed an unusual combination of basement membrane thickening and duplication, and increased number of pericytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This familial case has the characteristic features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611706" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myosclerosis</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> and carries a homozygous COL6A2 mutation responsible for a peculiar pattern of collagen VI defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrates that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611706" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myosclerosis</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> should be considered a collagen VI disorder allelic to Ullrich <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
