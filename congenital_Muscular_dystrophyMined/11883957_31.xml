<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Muscle-eye-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> (MEB) is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> disorder characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, ocular abnormalities and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001339'>lissencephaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recently found that MEB is caused by mutations in the protein O-linked <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> beta1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (POMGnT1) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>POMGnT1 is a glycosylation enzyme that participates in the synthesis of O-mannosyl glycan, a modification that is rare in mammals but is known to be a laminin-binding ligand of alpha-dystroglycan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we report a selective deficiency of alpha-dystroglycan in MEB patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that alpha-dystroglycan is a potential target of POMGnT1 and that altered glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan may play a critical role in the pathomechanism of MEB and some forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
