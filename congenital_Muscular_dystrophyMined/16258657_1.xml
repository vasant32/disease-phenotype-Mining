<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A mild or moderate involvement can be occasionally observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical picture of CMD patients with Ullrich phenotype who presented decreased or absent collagen VI immunoreactivity on muscular biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 60 patients with CMD, two had no expression of collagen V and their clinical involvement was essentially different: the first (3 years of follow-up) has mild motor difficulty; the second (8 years of follow-up) never acquired walking and depends on ventilatory support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A molecular study, performed by Pan et al. at the Thomas Jefferson University, demonstrated in the first a known mutation of Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> in COL6A1 and in the second the first dominantly acting mutation in UCMD and the first in COL6A1, previously associated only to Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, with benign course and dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> should be considered in the differential diagnosis of UCMD, even in patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100490'>fingers contractures</z:hpo>; overlap between Ullrich and Bethlem phenotypes can be supposed </plain></SENT>
