<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we show that this change in cell shape induces the expression of laminin (LM) alpha2 chain not present in round mesenchymal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LM alpha2 expression is reversible and switched on and off by altering the cell's shape in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In comparison, the expression of LM beta1 and gamma1 remains unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional studies showed that mesenchymal cell spreading and further differentiation into SM are inhibited by an antibody against LM alpha2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dy/dy mice express very low levels of LM alpha2 and exhibit <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lung SM cells isolated from adult dy/dy mice spread defectively and synthesized less SM alpha-actin, desmin, and SM-myosin than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These deficiencies were completely corrected by exogenous LM-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On histological examination, dy/dy mouse airways and gastrointestinal tract had shorter SM cells, and lungs from dy/dy mice contained less SM-specific protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The intestine, however, showed compensatory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, perhaps related to its higher contractile activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study therefore demonstrated a novel role for the LM alpha2 chain in SM myogenesis and showed that its decrease in dy/dy mice results in abnormal SM </plain></SENT>
