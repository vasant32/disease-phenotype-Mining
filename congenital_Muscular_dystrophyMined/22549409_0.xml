<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical phenotype in POMT1-mutated patients ranges from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) with structural brain abnormalities, to <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (LGMD) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, to mild LGMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No cardiac involvement has until now been reported in POMT1-mutated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report three patients who harbored compound heterozygous POMT1 mutations and showed left ventricular (LV) dilation and/or decrease in myocardial contractile force: two had a LGMD phenotype with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or close-to-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognitive profile and one had CMD with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reduced or absent α-DG immunolabeling in muscle biopsies were identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bioinformatic tools were used to study the potential effect of POMT1-detected mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the detected POMT1 mutations were predicted in silico to interfere with protein folding and/or glycosyltransferase function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The report on the patients described here has widened the clinical spectrum associated with POMT1 mutations to include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The functional impact of known and novel POMT1 mutations was predicted with a bioinformatics approach, and results were compared with previous in vitro studies of protein-o-mannosylase function </plain></SENT>
