<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a series of nine children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was established by the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001339'>lissencephaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002438'>cerebellar malformation</z:hpo> on computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children exhibited profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>psychomotor retardation</z:hpo> and ocular abnormalities (in their anterior or posterior eye chambers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The existence of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002085'>occipital encephalocele</z:hpo> in eight cases was the main diagnostic clue to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients were investigated for the presence for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, which was confirmed in only four of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no patients with a <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> or palate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We studied the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> in Spain and estimated it at 0.21 cases per 10,000 live-born children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In our series, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> was prevalent in the Spanish gypsy population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Consanguinity was present in five of seven affected families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In a case of pregnancy with twins, one of the siblings was unaffected </plain></SENT>
