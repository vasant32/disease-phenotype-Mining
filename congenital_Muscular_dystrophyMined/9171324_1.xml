<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>That collagen synthesis could be the primary abnormality has been suggested earlier (Fidzianska et al., 1982) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Amongst eighteen cases of CMD diagnosed during the past twelve years, muscle biopsy in three cases revealed prominence of myofibre <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and phagocytosis, and serum CPK was markedly elevated suggesting a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapidly progressive</z:hpo> form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In twelve cases, marked increase in endomysial collagen, pronounced fallout of myofibres and significant fibre diameter variation was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was associated with myonecrosis and regenerative activity of mild degree resembling the classical form of CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the remaining three cases, polyfocal, polyphasic <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was noticed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003555'>Fibre splitting</z:hpo> was more frequently observed, better delineated in the enzyme histochemical preparations, affecting both fibre types, while endomysial fibrofatty tissue was only moderately increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The histomorphology in the latter group resembled that of limb girdle <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural findings in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the eighteen cases correlated well with light microscopic observations. lmmunohistochemical studies done on three of the eighteen cases showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> localization of dystrophin protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such variable histomorphology, revealing a spectrum of myopathic features, suggests that the primary change in CMD is likely to be in the myofibre rather than in collagen synthesis </plain></SENT>
