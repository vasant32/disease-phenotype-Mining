<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using immunohistochemical methods, we assessed the distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 known laminin chains (alpha1-5, beta1-3, gamma1 and gamma2) in skeletal muscles from patients with Duchenne, congenital, limb girdle, or Emery-Dreifuss <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The alpha2, beta1 and gamma1 chains were abundant in the basal lamina surrounding muscle fibers in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls; alpha1, alpha3-alpha5, beta3, and gamma2 were undetectable; and beta2 was present at a low level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared to controls, levels of the alpha5 chain were increased in muscles from many dystrophic patients; levels of beta1 were reduced and/or levels of beta2 were increased in a minority </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, these changes were neither specific for, nor consistent within, diagnostic categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, levels of alpha4 were increased in muscles from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with alpha2 laminin (merosin)-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Loss of alpha2 laminin in congenital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> is disease-specific but some other changes in laminin isoform expression in <z:mp ids='MP_0000752'>dystrophic muscles</z:mp> could be secondary consequences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, denervation, regeneration or immaturity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To distinguish among these possibilities, we compared the laminins of embryonic, denervated, regenerating, and mutant mouse muscles with those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adult muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Embryonic muscle basal lamina contained alpha4 and alpha5 along with alpha2, and regenerating muscle re-expressed alpha5 but not alpha4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Levels of alpha5 but not alpha4 were increased in dystrophin (mdx) mutants and in dystrophin/utrophin double mutants (mdx:utrn -/-), models for Duchenne <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, laminin alpha4 was upregulated more than alpha5 in muscles of laminin alpha2 mutant mice (dy/dy; a model for alpha2-deficient congenital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, we hypothesize that the expression of alpha5 in many <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophies</z:mpath> reflects the regenerative process, whereas the selective expression of alpha4 in alpha2-deficient muscle is a specific compensatory response to loss of alpha2 </plain></SENT>
