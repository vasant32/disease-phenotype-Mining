<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the dy mouse model, which has <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> due to a defect in laminin alpha 2, for evidence of cochlear dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Auditory brainstem response (ABR) audiometry to pure tones was used to evaluate 3-month-old homozygous dy/dy and age-matched C57 control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The average ABR thresholds to tone-burst stimuli for four frequencies (4, 8, 16, and 32 kHz) were determined and statistically compared by ANOVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dy/dy mice demonstrated elevated auditory thresholds ranging from 25 to 27 dB at each frequency tested (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anatomic evaluations of the ears revealed pathology ranging from extensive connective tissue infiltration within the inner ear to possible minor defects in the cells of the organ of Corti </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These anatomic and physiologic observations suggest that the extracellular matrix protein laminin plays a crucial role in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cochlear function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the dy <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> mouse offers a novel model for evaluation of <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
