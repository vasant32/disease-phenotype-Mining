<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several forms of this disease have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The form associated with marked central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disturbances, frequent in Japan, is known as Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and was recently linked to chromosome 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most frequent form observed in occidental countries appears to be clinically characterized by exclusive involvement of skeletal muscle, and has been identified by clinico-pathological features which are often fallacious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A predominant histopathological feature is the marked increase in endomysial collagen tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We investigate whether laminin, a major component of the extracellular matrix, which is linked to the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton by a large oligomeric complex of dystrophin-associated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi>, could be involved in this form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed a specific absence of merosin, the laminin M chain, in 13 patients affected by classical non-Japanese form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This result allows the precise identification of a particular form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and gives a clue to understanding its molecular pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
