<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several gene expression studies indicated that SPARC was expressed in response to muscle damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies on myoblasts further indicated a function of SPARC in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore found it of interest to study SPARC expression in human skeletal muscle during development and in biopsies from Duchenne and Becker <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, inclusion body <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085655" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polymyositis</z:e> patients to analyze SPARC expression in a selected range of inherited and idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle wasting</z:hpo> diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SPARC-positive cells were observed both in fetal and neonatal muscle, and in addition, fetal myofibers were observed to express SPARC at the age of 15-16 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SPARC protein was detected in the majority of analyzed muscle biopsies (23 of 24), mainly in mononuclear cells of which few were pax7 positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Myotubes and regenerating myofibers also expressed SPARC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression-degree seemed to reflect the severity of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In accordance with these in vivo findings, primary human-derived satellite cells were found to express SPARC both during proliferation and differentiation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study shows SPARC expression both during muscle development and in regenerating muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The expression is detected both in satellite cells/myoblasts and in myotubes and muscle fibers, indicating a role for SPARC in the skeletal muscle compartment </plain></SENT>
