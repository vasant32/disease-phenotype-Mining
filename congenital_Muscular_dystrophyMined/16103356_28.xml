<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of the CMD cases are caused by genetic mutations of laminin-alpha2, which is essential for the structural integrity of muscle extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that somatic gene delivery of a structurally unrelated protein, a miniature version of agrin, functionally compensates for laminin-alpha2 deficiency in the murine models of CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adeno-associated virus-mediated overexpression of miniagrin restored the structural integrity of myofiber basal lamina, inhibited interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, and ameliorated dystrophic pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, systemic gene delivery of miniagrin into multiple vital muscles significantly improved whole body growth and motility and quadrupled the lifespan (50% survival) of the dystrophic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, our study demonstrated the efficacy of somatic gene therapy in a mouse model of CMD </plain></SENT>
