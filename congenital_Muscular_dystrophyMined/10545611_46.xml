<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we identified, on chromosome 9q31, the gene responsible for FCMD, which encodes a novel 461 amino acid protein which we have termed fukutin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most FCMD-bearing chromosomes examined to date (87%) have been derived from a single ancestral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e>, whose mutation consisted of a 3 kb retrotransposal insertion in the 3' non-coding region of the fukutin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FCMD is the first human disease known to be caused primarily by an ancient retrotransposal integration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We under-took a systematic analysis of the FCMD gene in 107 unrelated patients, and identified four novel non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutations in five of them: one missense, one nonsense, one L1 insertion and a 1 bp insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of severe phenotypes, including Walker-Walberg syndrome-like manifestations such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000568'>microphthalmia</z:hpo>, was significantly higher among probands who were compound heterozygotes carrying a point mutation on one allele and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutation on the other, than it was among probands who were homozygous for the 3 kb retrotransposon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, we detected no FCMD patients with non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> (point) mutations on both alleles of the gene, and suggest that such cases might be embryonic-lethal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This could explain why few FCMD cases are reported in non-Japanese populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results provided strong evidence that loss of function of fukutin is the major cause of FCMD, and appeared to shed some light on the mechanism responsible for the broad clinical spectrum seen in this disease </plain></SENT>
