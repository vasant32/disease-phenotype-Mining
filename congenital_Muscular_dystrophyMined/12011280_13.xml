<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Ullrich <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (UCMD) is a form of merosin-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> characterized by proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo>, distal laxity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> of the spine, and respiratory complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, a deficiency of collagen VI on muscle and skin biopsy together with recessive mutations in the collagen 6A2 gene were reported in three families with UCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical spectrum, frequency, and level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of this disorder are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects and Methods: The authors studied 15 patients (aged 3 to 23.6 years) with a clinical diagnosis of UCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linkage analysis to the three collagen VI genes was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> informative families (n = 7), whereas immunohistochemical analysis of collagen VI expression in muscle was performed in the remaining cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An immunocytochemical reduction of collagen VI was observed in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three of the six patients belonged to informative families, and haplotype analysis clearly suggested linkage to the COL6A1/2 locus in two cases and to the COL6A3 loci in the third case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the remaining nine patients, primary collagen VI involvement was excluded based on either the linkage analysis (four families) or considered unlikely based on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> immunolabeling of collagen VI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age and presentation at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, the distribution and severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo>, and the frequency of nonambulant patients were similar in the patients with and without collagen VI involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Distal laxity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> of the spine, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001508'>failure to thrive</z:hpo>, and early and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory impairment</z:hpo> were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients by the end of the first decade of life, irrespective of their maximum motor functional ability or their collagen status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that collagen VI involvement is relatively common in UCMD (40%); however, the role of this molecule was excluded in a number of cases, suggesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> of this condition </plain></SENT>
