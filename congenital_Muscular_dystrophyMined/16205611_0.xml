<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study has been to assess the prevalence of heart involvement in merosin-positive CMD patients examined by echocardiography and Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 10 merosin-positive CMD patients and 100 healthy children were evaluated by echocardiography and Doppler examinations and the results were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three out of 10 patients showed a reduction of the ejection fraction and of the shortening fraction; in 1 case, a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of left ventricular diastolic diameter was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the 10 patients examined by echocardiography and Doppler, a heart involvement has been observed in 25% of cases </plain></SENT>
