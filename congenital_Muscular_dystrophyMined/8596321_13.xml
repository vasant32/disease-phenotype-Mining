<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The alpha2 chain of laminin-2 (merosin), encoded by a gene on chromosome 6q22, is deficient in about half the cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of this condition has relied on immunocytochemical analysis of the alpha2 chain in muscle biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have observed that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skin also expresses laminin alpha2 in the basement membrane at the junction of the dermis and epidermis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we have investigated laminin alpha2 deficiency in skin biopsy specimens from two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Two patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> gave informed consent to a skin biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The girl was aged 10 and the boy was aged 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The specimens were labelled with a commercially available mouse monoclonal antibody and a rat monoclonal antibody (4H8-2), which recognise an 80 and a 380 kDa fragment of the alpha2 chain, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The antibodies were visualised by standard methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A muscle biopsy specimen was available for each case, and was processed with the skin biopsy samples (from the girl a few months previously, from the boy at age 14 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Skin biopsies were done on four controls with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> expression of laminin alpha2 on their skeletal muscle fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS We did not detect laminin alpha2 in skin specimens from either case, although the controls were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The muscle biopsy specimens from the girl showed a few fibres, with traces of laminin alpha2; those from the boy showed no laminin alpha2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Skin biopsy specimens will provide a useful alternative to muscle biopsy samples for the assessment of laminin-2 (merosin) status in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
