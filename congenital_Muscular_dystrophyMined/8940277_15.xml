<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fukuyama-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD), the second most common form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> in Japan, is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> associated with brain anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After our initial mapping of the FCMD locus to chromosome 9q31-33, we have further defined the locus within a approximately 5-cM region between D9S127 and D9S2111 and have found linkage disequilibrium between FCMD and D9S306 in this candidate region on 9q31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The high prevalence of FCMD among the Japanese, who are a relatively isolated population, provides an opportunity to utilize linkage-disequilibrium mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We developed three new microsatellites, near D9S306, from the FCMD YAC contig, determined their positions on YACs, and performed linkage-disequilibrium mapping with these markers and other newly published loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The maximum value of p(excess), which represents the strength of linkage disequilibrium, was obtained at D9S2107; and this value showed a relatively steady rise and fall across the region that is likely to contain FCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Distances between FCMD and each marker were presumed to be approximately 1 Mb, approximately 350 kb, approximately 140 kb, approximately 20 kb, approximately 280 kb, approximately 450 kb, and approximately 740 kb for D9S306, A107XF9, D9S2105, D9S2107, D9S172, D9S299, and D9S2109, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis using the three closest markers D9S2105, D9S2107, and D9S172 indicated that most FCMD-bearing chromosomes are derived from a single ancestral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> and suggested that these markers can be used for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> FCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the FCMD gene is most likely to lie within a region of &lt;100 kb containing D9S2107 </plain></SENT>
