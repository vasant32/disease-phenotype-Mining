<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify the pathomechanism of the ocular involvement in FCMD, we performed postmortem pathological analyses of eyes from three postnatal FCMD cases, two fetal FCMD cases, and three control cases by macroscopic, histopathological, immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The macroscopic and histopathological examinations revealed a variety of ocular abnormalities such as folding, fusion or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> of the retinas in the FCMD cases both with and without ophthalmological alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivities for collagen IV and laminin, produced by M端ller cells, as the basement membrane components, were less intense in the inner limiting membrane of the FCMD retinas than in that of the control retinas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A number of the perivascular glial cells containing S-100 protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein were increased in the postnatal FCMD cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivities for vimentin, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transporter-1, glutamine synthase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18257">ornithine</z:chebi> aminotransferase, expressed in the M端ller cells, were undetectable in the fetal FCMD retinas, and reduced in the postnatal FCMD retinas compared with the control retinas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fukutin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> signals were distributed diffusely in the retinoblast layer of the control retinas, focally in the retinoblast layer of the fetal FCMD retinas, and only in the dysplastic areas with rosette formation of the postnatal FCMD retinas, composed of retinoblasts and other <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> cells including the M端ller cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present findings suggest that the M端ller cells are implicated in the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> pathology of FCMD </plain></SENT>
