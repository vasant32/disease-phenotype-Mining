<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that the majority of patients with UCMD have sarcolemma-specific collagen VI deficiency (SSCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More recently, we found heterozygous COL6A1 glycine substitutions in patients with UCMD with SSCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To elucidate how COL6A1 glycine mutation leads to SSCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated the synthesis, formation, and binding of collagen VI to the extracellular matrix in fibroblasts with p.G284R mutation in COL6A1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Collagen VI was normally secreted into the cultured medium in fibroblasts harboring p.G284R mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the medium with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> collagen VI was added to collagen VI-deficient fibroblast culture, collagen VI bound surrounding the cells, while collagen VI with p.G284R mutation did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of fibroblasts with p.G284R mutation was markedly reduced similarly to that of collagen VI-deficient cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, this reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of the cells with p.G284R mutation was recovered by the addition of the medium with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> collagen VI, which would suggest a therapeutic strategy for a replacement therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Heterozygous glycine substitution in COL6A1 may cause decreased binding of collagen VI microfibrils to the extracellular matrix resulting in sarcolemma-specific collagen VI deficiency </plain></SENT>
