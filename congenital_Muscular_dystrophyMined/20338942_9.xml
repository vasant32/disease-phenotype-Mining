<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Collagen VI is an integral part of the skeletal muscle extracellular matrix, providing mechanical stability and facilitating matrix-dependent cell signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in collagen VI result in either Ullrich <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (UCMD) or Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (BM), with UCMD being clinically more severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies demonstrating <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> and abnormal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function in Col6a1 knockout mice and in human myoblasts have provided the first mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, how loss of collagen VI causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction remains to be understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Progress is hindered in part by the lack of an adequate animal model for UCMD, as knockout mice have a mild motor phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To further the understanding of these disorders, we have generated zebrafish models of the collagen VI <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Morpholinos designed to exon 9 of col6a1 produced a severe muscle disease reminiscent of UCMD, while ones to exon 13 produced a milder phenotype similar to BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>UCMD-like zebrafish have increased cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and abnormal mitochondria, which can be attenuated by treatment with the proton pump modifier <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CsA improved the motor deficits in UCMD-like zebrafish, but failed to reverse the sarcolemmal membrane damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, we have successfully generated the first vertebrate model matching the clinical severity of UCMD and demonstrated that CsA provides phenotypic improvement, thus corroborating data from knockout mice supporting the use of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> permeability transition pore modifiers as therapeutics in patients, and providing proof of principle for the utility of the zebrafish as a powerful preclinical model </plain></SENT>
