<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a murine model, we have tested the hypothesis that the maintenance of calcium homeostasis is mechanistic in extraocular muscle protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Atomic absorption spectroscopy has demonstrated a strong correlation between the perturbation of calcium homeostasis in hindlimb muscle that is severely damaged and the absence of changes in calcium in extraocular muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If, as in other skeletal muscles, extraocular muscle fibers are destabilized by merosin deficiency, we would expect an increase in total muscle calcium coupled with an adaptive response in the high capacity/speed of the sarcoplasmic reticulum of the eye muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, we have not observed the expected increases in total muscle calcium content, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-ATPase activity, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> exchanger content, or smooth ER <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-ATPase content that are predicted by this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Instead, these results indicate that the increased membrane permeability that characterizes, and is potentially mechanistic in, myofiber degeneration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> does not occur in merosin-deficient extraocular muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the high-capacity calcium-scavenging systems are not primarily responsible for extraocular muscle protection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
