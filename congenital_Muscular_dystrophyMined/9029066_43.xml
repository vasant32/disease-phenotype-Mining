<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The nosological relationship of these inherited malformative disorders is still unestablished, although the genetic locus for FCMD has been excluded in MEB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present the first postmortem neuropathological study of MEB based on 2 male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Apart from sharply limited occipital agyric areas, their brains showed coarse gyri with an abnormally nodular surface ("cobblestone cortex") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both the cerebral and cerebellar cortices showed a total disorganization without horizontal lamination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The haphazardly oriented cortical neurons formed irregular clusters or islands, separated by gliovascular strands extending from the pia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ocular abnormalities included a pronounced glial preretinal membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although MEB shares the cobblestone cortex-type malformation with FCMD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e>, the cerebral and ocular manifestations are less severe than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a consistently weak staining for laminin alpha2 chain (merosin) was found in muscle biopsy specimens from 4 MEB patients, while <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> immunoreactivity was observed for the laminin beta2 chain, reported to be severely deficient in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings support nosological independence of MEB </plain></SENT>
