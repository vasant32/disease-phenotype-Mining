<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anisotropically restricted diffusion was demonstrated within white matter, which appeared to be myelinated with T1-weighted inversion recovery or spin echo sequences and within white matter where the presence of myelin was not demonstrated with these sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>Cysts</z:mpath> and fluid collections were recognised by their low signal intensity using PGSE sequences in the subcortical regions, lentiform nuclei, and periventricular regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> showed a high signal intensity with PGSE sequences consistent with isotropically restricted diffusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> infarction displayed a low signal intensity consistent with relatively free isotropic diffusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002415'>leukodystrophy</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> showed an anisotropic pattern with different components of the abnormality present on images with sensitization in different directions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The corticospinal tracts failed to show highlighting in three cases where conventional imaging was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In several patients with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004045" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">birth asphyxia</z:e>, asymmetry and a relative reduction in signal intensity were seen in the corticospinal tracts </plain></SENT>
