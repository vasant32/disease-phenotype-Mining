<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients form a clinically homogenous group presenting merosin (laminin alpha 2-chain) deficiency in muscle biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The LAMA2 gene has been previously localized on 6q22-23 and the disease locus mapped in a 16 cM interval in 6q2 by homozygosity mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present report we establish, by haplotyping additional microsatellites markers in 18 consanguineous families, that LAMA2 gene is more centromeric than previously thought: between the flanking markers, D6S407 and D6S1705, distant of 3 cM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this interval the microsatellite D6S1620 is homozygous for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The localization of LAMA2 gene was confirmed by radiation hybrid mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 3 new highly informative markers can be very useful for prenatal diagnosis </plain></SENT>
