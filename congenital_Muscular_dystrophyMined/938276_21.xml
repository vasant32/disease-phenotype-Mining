<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pathological alterations included diffuse cerebral and cerebellar micropolygyria, with bilateral temporal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001339'>agyria</z:hpo>, and abnormal fusion of gray matter in the basal portions of both frontal hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microscopically, the architecture of both cerebral and cerebellar cortices was severely distorted, with irregular arrangement of neurons and increased vascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Skeletal muscles showed dystrophic changes rather than neurogenic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight autopsy cases of CMD with similar pathologic findings have been reported in Japan, although the lesions in the brain are quantitatively different from case to case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The findings indicate that CMD is a dysplastic disease of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, with dystrophic involvement of skeletal muscles </plain></SENT>
