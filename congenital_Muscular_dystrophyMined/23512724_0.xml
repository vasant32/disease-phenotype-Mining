<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Introduction: Tirasemtiv is a novel small molecule activator of the fast skeletal muscle troponin complex that produces sensitization of the sarcomere to calcium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tirasemtiv is currently in Phase II clinical trials for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: We conducted a blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled preclinical study of the effect of tirasemtiv on forearm grip strength, endurance, respiratory <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp>, and muscle pathology in adequate sample sizes of the Lama2(dy-2J) mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results: Mice receiving a high dose of tirasemtiv had significantly higher muscle fiber cross sectional area and respiratory response to <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> stimulation at 16 weeks than mice on low dose or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no changes in muscle pathology, serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase, strength, endurance, or respiration following long-term treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Discussion: We conclude that tirasemtiv influences the structure of the skeletal muscle fiber in this model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> but does not impact muscle function, as evaluated in this study.
