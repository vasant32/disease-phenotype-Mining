<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The past decade of researches have revealed mutations of known or putative glycosyltransferases in several types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, including Fukuyama-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In these disorders, the function of α-dystroglycan is severely decreased, therefore they are called α-dystroglycanopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, putative glycosyltransferase Large was shown to restore the defective function of α-dystroglycan, thus, it is an intriguing idea to apply this effect to the therapy of α-dystroglycanopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we sought to test this possibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using several cultured cell lines, we confirmed that the overexpression of Large results in hyperglycosylation and marked enhancement of the function of α-dystroglycan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For this effect, the whole <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> domain of Large was shown to be necessary using several deletion constructs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We further generated transgenic mice overexpressing Large ubiquitously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In each tissue of the mice, the glycosylation of α-dystroglycan and its laminin binding activity was remarkably increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the morphological analyses on each tissue stained by H-E revealed no significant abnormality in the transgenic mice, suggesting no serious side effects by the overexpression of Large </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results indicate that the restoration of the function of α-dystroglycan by Large should be an important molecular target to develop therapeutic strategies for α-dystroglycanopathy </plain></SENT>
