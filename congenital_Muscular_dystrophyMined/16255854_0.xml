<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although absence of dystrophin and subsarcolemmic protein has been known as the cause of muscle fiber degeneration, pathogenesis of interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the role of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in PMD and its relationship with muscular <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunological localization of CTGF was examined in frozen muscle specimens obtained via biopsy from 8 patients with Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD), 2 patients with Becker <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (BMD), 6 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) and 6 cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> muscle by immunohistochemistry, double immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results of immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence showed that CTGF was positive only in vessels of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis showed that CTGF expression was distinctly increased in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> muscles of PMD than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> muscle, marked immunostaining of CTGF was not only observed in vascular walls, but also strongly expressed in the cytoplasm and nuclei of regenerating muscle fibers, and also immunolocalized in the muscle fiber sarcolemma of non-regenerating fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Double labeling with antibodies against CTGF and CD68 demonstrated that CTGF was expressed in some macrophages and some macrophage infiltrated necrotic fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CTGF was strongly expressed in endomysial and perimysial connective tissues of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> muscles of patients with DMD, CMD and FCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Double immunolabeling revealed that most activated fibroblasts in perimysium and endomysium were positive for CTGF, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of connective tissues were co-localized with CTGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Older cases with FCMD showed poor or no expression of CTGF in advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CTGF may play a role in the pathogenetic process of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, and CTGF may be important for muscle repair and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
