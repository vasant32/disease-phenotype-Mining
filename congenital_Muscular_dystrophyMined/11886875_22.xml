<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The alpha2 G-domain modules, mutated in several of these disorders, are thought to mediate different cellular interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To analyze these contributions, we expressed recombinant laminin-2 (alpha(2)beta(1)gamma(1)) with LG4-5, LG1-3, and LG1-5 modular deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> and LG4-5 deleted-laminins were isolated from medium intact and cleaved within LG3 by a furin-like convertase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Myoblasts adhered predominantly through LG1-3 while alpha-dystroglycan bound to both LG1-3 and LG4-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recombinant laminin stimulated <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> receptor (AChR) clustering; however, clustering was induced only by the proteolytic processed form, even in the absence of LG4-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, clustering required alpha(6)beta(1) integrin and alpha-dystroglycan binding activities available on LG1-3, acting in concert with laminin polymerization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ability of the modified laminins to mediate basement membrane assembly was also evaluated in embryoid bodies where it was found that both LG1-3 and LG4-5, but not processing, were required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, there is a division of labor among LG-modules in which (i) LG4-5 is required for basement membrane assembly but not for AChR clustering, and (ii) laminin-induced AChR clustering requires furin cleavage of LG3 as well as alpha-dystroglycan and alpha(6)beta(1) integrin binding </plain></SENT>
