<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have established a monoclonal antibody against a human skeletal muscle extracellular matrix protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antibody M1 recognized a single 180-kDa protein (p180) by immunoblot analysis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human skeletal muscle and gave a strong and continuous signal along the sarcolemma by immunohistochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, p180 could be solubilized either under a strong alkaline condition, or in the presence of EDTA or detergents such as <z:chebi fb="60" ids="29234">Triton</z:chebi> X-100, indicating that p180 was an extracellular matrix protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, p180 was deficient in the skeletal muscle of the patients with Fukuyama-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD), but not other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026848" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">muscular diseases</z:e>, by both immunohistochemical and immunoblot analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We presume that the deficiency of p180 in FCMD is caused specifically by the primary deficiency of fukutin, the causative protein of FCMD, and plays an important role in muscle cell degeneration in this disease </plain></SENT>
