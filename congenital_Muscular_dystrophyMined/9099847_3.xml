<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the laminin alpha2 chain is also expressed in the trophoblast, its detection and linkage analysis are useful tools for prenatal diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report our experience of seven prenatal diagnoses in families with partial deficiency or total absence of the laminin alpha2 chain in the muscle of the propositi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In five instances, expression of the laminin alpha2 chain in the trophoblast was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and linkage data suggested that the fetuses were unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one family, the immunocytochemical studies of the trophoblast showed the absence of laminin alpha2, suggesting that the fetus was affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Linkage analysis confirmed that the fetus had inherited the two at-risk haplotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one family with partial laminin alpha2 chain deficiency, the haplotype analysis was hampered by maternal DNA contamination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemical analysis of chorionic villus sampling showed a reduction in laminin alpha2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pregnancy was presumed to be at high-risk and terminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, subsequent analysis of fetal DNA indicated that the fetus was probably heterozygous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that immunocytochemical analysis of the trophoblast can detect abnormalities in affected fetuses and gives <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> results in unaffected and carrier fetuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, we recommend that linkage analysis to the LAMA2 locus is also studied in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
