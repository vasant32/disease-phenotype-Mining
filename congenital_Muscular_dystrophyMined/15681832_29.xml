<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that reduction or elimination of myostatin could be a treatment for degenerative muscle diseases such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Laminin-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> is one of the most severe forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test the possibility of ameliorating the dystrophic phenotype in laminin deficiency by eliminating myostatin, we crossed dy(W) laminin alpha2-deficient and myostatin null mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The resulting double-deficient dy(W)/dy(W);Mstn(-/-) mice had a severe clinical phenotype similar to that of dy(W)/dy(W) mice, even though <z:mp ids='MP_0000750'>muscle regeneration</z:mp> was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Degeneration and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of muscle were not alleviated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pre-weaning mortality of dy(W)/dy(W);Mstn(-/-) mice was increased compared to dy(W)/dy(W), most likely due to significantly less brown and white fat in the absence of myostatin, and postweaning mortality was not significantly improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results show that eliminating myostatin in laminin-deficiency promotes muscle formation, but at the expense of fat formation, and does not reduce muscle pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Any future therapy based on myostatin may have undesirable side effects </plain></SENT>
