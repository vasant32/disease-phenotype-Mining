<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> coupled with severe ocular and brain malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in at least one-fifth of the reported cases, mutations in the POMT1 gene are responsible for this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During embryonic development (E8.5 to E11.5), the mouse Pomt1 gene is expressed in the tissues most severely affected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e>, the muscle, eye, and brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we show that mPomt1 expression is maintained in the muscle and eye in later developmental stages and, notably, that its expression is particularly strong in regions of brain and cerebellum that, when affected, could generate the defects observed in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show that the Pomt1 protein is localized to the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle tissue cells in adult mice, where alpha-dystroglycan is O-glycosylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the Pomt1 protein is localized to the acrosome of maturing spermatids, where alpha-dystroglycan is not glycosylated, so that Pomt1 might have a different target for O-mannosylation in the testes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This expression pattern in the testes could also be related to the gonadal anomalies observed in some patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
