<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Several types of inborn errors of the O-glycan biosynthesis are known, leading to clinically very distinct phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Children with O-mannosyl glycan biosynthesis defects commonly present as a severe form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> with decreased alpha-dystroglycan staining, congenital eye anomalies, and brain migration defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alpha-dystroglycan is an O-mannosylated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> with additional mucin type O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Based on overlapping clinical features with O-mannosyl glycan defects, especially with muscle-eye-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e>, the authors performed a muscle biopsy in a child with severe congenital <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011003'>high myopia</z:hpo>, partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001302'>pachygyria</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000973'>cutis laxa</z:hpo>, and an inborn error affecting the biosynthesis of both mucin type O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> and N-linked <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The histology showed no signs of muscle <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath>, but a mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with slight increase in the muscle fiber diameter variability and type I fiber predominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant decrease in the alpha-dystroglycan staining was detected; therefore, in spite of the phenotypic similarities the authors could not confirm the role of abnormal dystroglycan in the etiology of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> and the developmental anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011003'>High myopia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo>, and cortical neuronal migration abnormalities are common in disorders of O-mannosylation and also observed in the authors' patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, compared to the severe generalized defect observed in mannosyl glycan defects, in this child the cerebral white matter and cerebellum were spared, and no muscle <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> could be confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the first description of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011003'>high myopia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000973'>cutis laxa</z:hpo> syndrome in combination with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital disorders</z:e> of glycosylation </plain></SENT>
