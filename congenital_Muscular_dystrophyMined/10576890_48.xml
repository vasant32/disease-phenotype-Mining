<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have found that the ECM substrates fibronectin, vitronectin, and laminin-2 (merosin) have no effect on differentiation, as measured by the appearance of myelin basic protein-expressing cells, but that laminin-2 substrates dramatically enhance myelin membrane formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blocking antibody and immunolocalization studies suggest that this effect is mediated via 1 integrins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The v integrins expressed on oligodendrocytes, in contrast, are less effective at promoting membrane formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results show that the interaction between laminin-2 expressed in white matter tracts and oligodendrocyte laminin-binding integrins may be an important part of the signalling mechanisms that stimulate oligodendrocytes to elaborate the extensive myelin membrane required to wrap the axon and form the myelin sheath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results also provide a logical explanation for the abnormalities of myelination observed in humans with merosin-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
