<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Later features include myopathic facial appearance; <z:hpo ids='HP_0003707'>pseudohypertrophy of the calves</z:hpo> and forearms; motor and speech retardation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>intellectual disability</z:hpo>; <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp>; ophthalmologic abnormalities including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>visual impairment</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007973'>retinal dysplasia</z:hpo>; and progressive cardiac involvement in individuals over age ten years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Swallowing disturbance occurs in individuals with severe FCMD and in individuals over age ten years, leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002100'>recurrent aspiration pneumonia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of FCMD is established by clinical findings and characteristic findings on neuroimaging, electromyography, measurement of serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase concentration, muscle biopsy, and molecular genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FKTN (formerly FCMD) is the only gene known to be associated with FCMD </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Once an at-risk sib is known to be unaffected, the risk of his/her being a carrier is 2/3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>When the mutations have been identified in the proband, carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk are possible </plain></SENT>
