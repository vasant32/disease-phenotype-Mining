<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now report an infant with merosin-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> with a mild degree of white matter changes already present on brain magnetic resonance imaging at 5 days of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The difference may be due to a difference in the T2 sequences used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The images in this present case were obtained with a fast spin echo sequence (echo time: 210 ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increased T2 weighted may be responsible for a better detection of the white matter changes at an early stage, when they can be missed on conventional, less weighting T2 sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that, by using appropriate sequences, mild white matter changes may be detectable on brain magnetic resonance imaging in the first days of life in infants with merosin-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
