<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis of the LAMA2 gene revealed two previously un-described mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient achieved independent sitting at age 2, but lost head balance at age 7; he was never able to stand unsupported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging revealed diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0003429'>hypomyelination</z:hpo> in both cerebral hemispheres; electrophysiological assessment revealed progressive sensorimotor axonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Investigation of the primary molecular defect in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> patients is important for genetic counseling, because the clinical features of the various forms overlap, and because significant laminin alpha2 chain reduction may occur in patients with primary defects in other genes </plain></SENT>
