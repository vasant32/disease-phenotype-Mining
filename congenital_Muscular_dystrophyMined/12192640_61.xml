<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MmD is a clinically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> condition, in which four subgroups have been distinguished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Homozygous RYR1 mutations have been recently identified in the moderate form of MmD with hand involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The genes responsible for the three other forms (including the most prevalent phenotype, termed the "classical" phenotype) remained, so far, unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To further characterize the genetic basis of MmD, we analyzed a series of 62 patients through a combined positional/candidate-gene approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the basis of clinical and morphological data, we suspected a relationship between classical MmD and the selenoprotein N gene (SEPN1), which is located on chromosome 1p36 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RSMD1</z:e> locus) and is responsible for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003306'>rigid spine</z:hpo> syndrome (RSMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A genomewide screening, followed by the analysis of 1p36 microsatellite markers in 27 informative families with MmD, demonstrated linkage to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RSMD1</z:e> in eight families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> showed an axial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo>, consistent with the most severe end of the classical MmD spectrum; <z:hpo ids='HP_0003306'>spinal rigidity</z:hpo> was evident in some, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We excluded linkage to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RSMD1</z:e> in 19 families with MmD, including 9 with classical MmD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Screening of SEPN1 in the 8 families that showed linkage and in 14 patients with classical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> disease disclosed 9 mutations affecting 17 patients (12 families); 6 were novel mutations, and 3 had been described in patients with RSMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analysis of three deltoid biopsy specimens from patients with typical RSMD revealed a wide myopathological variability, ranging from a dystrophic to a congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A variable proportion of minicores was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The present study represents the first identification of a gene responsible for classical MmD, demonstrates its <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo>, and reassesses the nosological boundaries between MmD and RSMD </plain></SENT>
