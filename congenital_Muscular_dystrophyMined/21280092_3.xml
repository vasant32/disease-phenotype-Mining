<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinically unaffected parents carrying large genomic deletions of COL6A1and COL6A2also provide conclusive evidence that haploinsufficiency for COL6A1and COL6A2is not a disease mechanism for Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our findings have important implications for the genetic evaluation of patients with collagen VI-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> as well as for potential therapeutic interventions for this patient population </plain></SENT>
