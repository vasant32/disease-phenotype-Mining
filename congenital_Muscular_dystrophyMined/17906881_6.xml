<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinically, MEB patients present with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001252'>muscular hypotonia</z:hpo>, severely compromised motor development, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging reveals a <z:hpo ids='HP_0007260'>lissencephaly type II</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002365'>hypoplasia of the brainstem</z:hpo> and cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MEB is associated with mutations in the gene for protein O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (POMGnT1, OMIM 606822) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we report the clinical findings of nine MEB patients from eight families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight of the nine patients presented typical features of MEB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, a broad <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>phenotypic variability</z:hpo> was observed, ranging from two patients with severe autistic features to another patient with an unusually mild phenotype, initially diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006882'>severe hydrocephalus</z:hpo> was reported in two families during a previous pregnancy, emphasizing the phenotypic overlap with Walker-Warburg syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition to three previously reported mutations, we identified six novel POMGnT1 mutations (one missense, five truncating) in the present patient cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest mutational hotspots within the minimal catalytic domain at <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32700">arginine residue</z:chebi> 442 (exon 16) and in intron 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is interesting to note that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mutations analyzed so far result in a complete loss of enzyme activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we conclude that the type and position of the POMGnT1 mutations are not of predictive value for the clinical severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This supports the notion that additional environmental and/or genetic factors may contribute to the observed broad spectrum of POMGnT1-associated phenotypes </plain></SENT>
