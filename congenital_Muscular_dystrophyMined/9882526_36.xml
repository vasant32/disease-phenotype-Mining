<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The dy/dy mouse is an animal model for human merosin-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD), which has been reported to have reduced or no expression of the basement membrane protein laminin alpha2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We here investigate various myogenic and nonmyogenic tissues of mature dy/dy and control 129ReJ mice histologically and for laminin alpha2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, expression patterns of laminin alpha1, alpha2, alpha4, and alpha5 chains, the interstitial proteins fibronectin and tenascin-C, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and alpha4 integrin were characterized in skeletal muscle of 1- and 7-day and mature (&gt;6 weeks old) dy/dy and control 129ReJ mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The laminin alpha2 chain remained detectable in myogenic tissues of dy/dy mice by immunofluorescence using two different monoclonal antibodies and by Northern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, laminin alpha2 expression was significantly reduced or not detectable in nonmyogenic tissues of dy/dy mice, including skin, lung, kidney, brain, thymus, and eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Focal lesions were observed in mature skeletal muscle only, characterized by necrotic tissue, isolated VCAM-1- and ICAM-1-positive cells indicative of inflammatory processes, and regenerating muscle fibers surrounded by intense tenascin-C and fibronectin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to studies on human CMD muscle, laminin alpha1 was not detectable in either dy/dy or control skeletal muscle using immunofluorescence or Northern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence localized laminin alpha4 to basement membranes of blood vessels, the endoneurium of the intramuscular nerves, and the neuromuscular junction in skeletal muscle of 1- and 7-day-old dy/dy and control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In mature muscle, laminin alpha4 expression shifted to the perineurium of intramuscular nerves in both dy/dy and control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, strong upregulation of laminin alpha4 in the basement membranes of blood vessels, the perineurium of intramuscular nerves, and of isolated regenerating muscle fibers in the dy/dy mice was apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Investigation of 1-day-old animals revealed expression of laminin alpha5 in skeletal muscle fiber basement membranes of dy/dy but not control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This difference between dy/dy and control animals was no longer apparent at 7 days after birth, indicating a temporary shift in expression pattern of laminin alpha5 in dy/dy animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the extracellular matrix components of 1- and 7-day-old dy/dy and control skeletal muscle revealed an early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath>, even before histopathological features of the disease were evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our data confirm the absence of laminin alpha1 chain in myogenic tissues of both dy/dy and control mice and suggest compensation for reduced laminin alpha2 in dy/dy skeletal muscle by laminin alpha4 and, in early development, also laminin alpha5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results have significant ramifications in the diagnosis of human merosin-negative CMD </plain></SENT>
