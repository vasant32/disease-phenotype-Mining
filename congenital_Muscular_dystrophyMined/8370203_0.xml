<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with Fukuyama-type CMD (FCMD), characterized by progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> and occasionally, <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp>, are more frequently seen in Japan than those with non-Fukuyama type CMD (NFCMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FCMD has been regarded as a distinct clinical and pathological entity, although the nosologic status of CMD is still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 24-year-old man had exhibited <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> at birth and delay in early development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During childhood, his <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscular weakness</z:hpo> improved, and he rode a bicycle and enjoyed skiing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, his strength began to deteriorate at the age of 19 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination on admission revealed prominent muscular <z:mp ids='MP_0005150'>wasting</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, predominantly in the proximal limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>He had ocular involvement (<z:hpo ids='HP_0007759'>corneal opacity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000514'>slow saccades</z:hpo>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000407'>sensorineural deafness</z:hpo>, and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000156'>high-arched palate</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011120'>saddle nose</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>funnel chest</z:hpo> as anomalous conditions </plain></SENT>
