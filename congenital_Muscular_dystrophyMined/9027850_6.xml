<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report we describe the early manifestation and evolution of brain changes, and the involvement of the peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system in a female infant with merosin-deficient CMD diagnosed in the neonatal period who had sequential clinical, neurophysiological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both MRI and nerve conduction velocity in the first week of life failed to demonstrate any abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By 6 months of age both nerve conduction and MRI were abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>White matter changes became more evident on a further scan at 1 yr of age and this pattern remained unchanged on the following scan performed at 17 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest a failure in the physiological maturation process of myelination of both the central and peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
