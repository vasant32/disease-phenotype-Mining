<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Dystroglycanopathies are a clinically and genetically diverse group of recessively inherited conditions ranging from the most severe of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophies</z:hpo>, Walker-Warburg syndrome, to mild forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their hallmark is a reduction in the functional glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, which can be detected in muscle biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An important part of this glycosylation is a unique O-mannosylation, essential for the interaction of α-dystroglycan with extracellular matrix proteins such as laminin-α2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations in eight genes coding for proteins in the glycosylation pathway are responsible for ∼50% of dystroglycanopathy cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite multiple efforts using traditional positional cloning, the causative genes for unsolved dystroglycanopathy cases have escaped discovery for several years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a recent collaborative study, we discovered that loss-of-function recessive mutations in a novel gene, called <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24913">isoprenoid</z:chebi> synthase domain containing (ISPD), are a relatively common cause of Walker-Warburg syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this article, we report the involvement of the ISPD gene in milder dystroglycanopathy phenotypes ranging from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and identified allelic ISPD variants in nine cases belonging to seven families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two ambulant cases, there was evidence of structural brain involvement, whereas in seven, the clinical manifestation was restricted to a dystrophic skeletal <z:mp ids='MP_0005369'>muscle phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the function of ISPD in mammals is not yet known, mutations in this gene clearly lead to a reduction in the functional glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, which not only causes the severe Walker-Warburg syndrome but is also a common cause of the milder forms of dystroglycanopathy </plain></SENT>
