<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>POMGnT1 is a glycosylation enzyme that participates in the synthesis of O-mannosyl glycan </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient with R442H mutation had the classical form of the disease although the one with IVS17-2A--&gt;G homozygous mutation had severe autistic features as the dominating presenting sign </plain></SENT>
