<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At present, none of the existing diagnostic techniques for evaluating collagen VI expression is quantitative, and the detection of subtle changes in collagen VI expression remains challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated flow cytometry analysis as a means of quantitatively measuring collagen VI in primary fibroblasts and compared this method with the standard method of fibroblast collagen VI immunohistochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight UCMD and five BM molecularly confirmed patients were studied and compared to five controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry analysis consistently detected a reduction of collagen VI of at least 60% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> UCMD cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In BM cases the levels of collagen VI were variable but on average 20% less than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry analysis provides an alternative method for screening for collagen VI deficiency at the protein level in a quantitative, time and cost-effective manner </plain></SENT>
