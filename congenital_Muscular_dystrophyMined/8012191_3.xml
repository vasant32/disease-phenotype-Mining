<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The expression of the 43 kDa dystrophin-associated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (43DAG) has been studied using immunohistochemical labelling with a monoclonal antibody, MANDAG-1, and compared with immunolabelling for dystrophin and the dystrophin-related protein, utrophin, in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> muscle and in muscle from 50 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>43DAG and dystrophin were expressed in vascular smooth muscle and at the sarcolemma of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> muscle fibres, with increased labelling at neuromuscular and myotendinous junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>43DAG expression was reduced in Duchenne and Becker <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophies</z:mpath> with patchy labelling, more intense around presumptive satellite cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Duchenne <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath>, there was increased 43DAG expression in "<z:mp ids='MP_0003171'>revertant</z:mp>" fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Becker <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath>, 43DAG expression was more extensive around individual fibres, showed more interfibre variation and was more closely related to the intensity of immunolabelling for both dystrophin and utrophin than in Duchenne <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular diseases</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, no abnormalities of 43DAG expression were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that in the absence of dystrophin, 43DAG is synthesized but is not stabilized in the sarcolemma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stability is greater in Becker <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> but a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> dystrophin molecule appears to be required for the complete and stable membrane integration of 43DAG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Utrophin may confer some additional stability to the membrane integration of 43DAG but this is incomplete where dystrophin is absent or abnormal </plain></SENT>
