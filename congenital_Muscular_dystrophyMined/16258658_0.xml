<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many different subtypes have been genetically identified and most phenotypes not yet identified belong to the merosin-positive (MP) CMD subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze the immunohistochemical expression of the main proteins of the dystrophin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> associated complex in muscle biopsy of patients with different CMD phenotypes, for investigating a possible correlation with clinical and histopathological data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Fifty-nine patients with CMD had clinical, histopathological and immunohistochemical data evaluated: 32 had MP-CMD, 23 CMD with merosin deficiency (MD-CMD), one Ullrich phenotype and three Walker-Warburg disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dystrophin and dysferlin were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>; among the patients with MD-CMD, merosin deficiency was partial in nine who showed the same clinical severity as those with total deficiency; the reduced expression of alpha-sarcoglycan (SG) and alpha-dystroglycan (DG) showed statistically significant correlation with severe MD-CMD phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is a greater relationship between merosin and the former proteins; among MP-CMD patients, no remarkable immunohistochemical/phenotypical correlations were found, although the reduced expression of beta-DG had showed statistically significant correlation with severe phenotype and marked <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> on muscular biopsy </plain></SENT>
