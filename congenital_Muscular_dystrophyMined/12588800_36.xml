<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the MEB phenotype overlaps substantially with those of Fukuyama-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD) and Walker-Warburg syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e>), these three diseases are thought to result from a similar pathomechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, we showed that MEB is caused by mutations in the protein O-linked <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> beta1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (POMGnT1) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe here the identification of seven novel disease-causing mutations in six of not only non-Finnish Caucasian but also Japanese and Korean patients with suspected MEB, severe FCMD or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Including six previously reported mutations, the 13 disease-causing mutations we have found thus far are dispersed throughout the entire POMGnT1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also observed a slight correlation between the location of the mutation and clinical severity in the brain: patients with mutations near the 5' terminus of the POMGnT1 coding region show relatively severe brain symptoms such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, while patients with mutations near the 3' terminus have milder phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that MEB may exist in population groups outside of Finland, with a worldwide distribution beyond our expectations, and that the clinical spectrum of MEB is broader than recognized previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings emphasize the importance of considering MEB and searching for POMGnT1 mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> or other <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> patients worldwide </plain></SENT>
