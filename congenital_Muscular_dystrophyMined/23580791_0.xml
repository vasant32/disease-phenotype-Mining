<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A dystrophic mouse model, where collagen VI synthesis was prevented by targeted inactivation of the Col6a1 gene, allowed the investigation of pathogenesis, which revealed the existence of a Ca(2+)-mediated dysfunction of mitochondria and sarcoplasmic reticulum, and of defective autophagy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Key events are dysregulation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> permeability transition pore, an inner membrane high-conductance channel that for prolonged open times causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction, and inadequate removal of defective mitochondria, which amplifies the damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consistently, the Col6a1(-/-) myopathic mice could be cured through inhibition of cyclophilin D, a matrix protein that sensitizes the pore to opening, and through stimulation of autophagy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar defects contribute to disease pathogenesis in patients irrespective of the genetic lesion causing the collagen VI defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These studies indicate that permeability transition pore opening and defective autophagy represent key elements for skeletal muscle fiber <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and provide a rationale for the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> and its nonimmunosuppressive derivatives in patients affected by collagen VI <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo>, a strategy that holds great promise for treatment </plain></SENT>
