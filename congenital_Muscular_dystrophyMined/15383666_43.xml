<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>O-mannosylation is an important protein modification in eukaryotes that is initiated by an evolutionarily conserved family of protein O-mannosyltransferases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first mammalian protein O-mannosyltransferase gene described was the human POMT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the hPOMT1 gene are responsible for Walker-Warburg syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e>), a severe recessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> associated with defects in neuronal migration that produce complex brain and eye abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During embryogenesis, the murine Pomt1 gene is prominently expressed in the neural tube, the developing eye, and the mesenchyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These sites of expression correlate with those in which the main tissue alterations are observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have inactivated a Pomt1 allele by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells and produced chimeras transmitting the defect allele to offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although heterozygous mice were viable and fertile, the total absence of Pomt1(-/-) pups in the progeny of heterozygous intercrosses indicated that this genotype is embryonic lethal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An analysis of the mutant phenotype revealed that homozygous Pomt1(-/-) mice suffer <z:hpo ids='HP_0007281'>developmental arrest</z:hpo> around embryonic day (E) 7.5 and die between E7.5 and E9.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Pomt1(-/-) embryos present defects in the formation of Reichert's membrane, the first basement membrane to form in the embryo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The failure of this membrane to form appears to be the result of abnormal glycosylation and maturation of dystroglycan that may impair recruitment of laminin, a structural component required for the formation of Reichert's membrane in rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The targeted disruption of mPomt1 represents an example of an engineered deletion of a known glycosyltransferase involved in O-mannosyl glycan synthesis </plain></SENT>
