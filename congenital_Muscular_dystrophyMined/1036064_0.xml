<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>(Fokuyama type) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The micropolygyria of the cerebral cortex showed an undifferentiated cytoarchitecture, e. g. status verrucosus deformis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the surface of cortical molecular layer, subpial mesenchymal fibres, tangential myelin fibres and marginal glial fibres were observed to be still proliferated even at the stages examined and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the fibres were caved into the cortical cell layer associated with the molecular layer, without secondary sulcus formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that micropolygyria without secondary sulcus formation described in the present paper is named as "pachygyric micropolygyria", while four-layered type of micropolygyria with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sulcus formation is "eugyric micropolygyria" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, micropolygyria of the cerebellar cortex was found to be consisted of various sized fragments in which basic structures of the cerebellum were preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On a part of surface of the cerebellar cortex the cytoarchitecture of cell layers was shown in inverse order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Purkinje cell were irregularly migrated and the external granular layer remained in the molecular layer showing ectopic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tangential myelin fibres, connecting with fibres of the folial white matter, were observed to exist on the surface of the internal granular layer </plain></SENT>
