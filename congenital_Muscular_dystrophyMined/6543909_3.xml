<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In FCMD, many fibers showed morphological changes of the T-system as follows: aggregated tubular components forming honeycomb-like structures, focal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of T-tubules with tangle formation, and numerous longitudinally projecting tubules, which were quite similar to those found in cases with DMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The fibers with abnormal T-systems occasionally showed ultrastructural characteristics of regenerating fibers, including excessive ribosome particles, immaturely organized myofibrils, and an increased number of internal nuclei and satellite cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present results suggested that there was no qualitative difference in the behavior of the T-system between FCMD and DMD, and the morphological changes of the T-system in <z:mp ids='MP_0000752'>dystrophic muscles</z:mp> were not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1402294" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary lesions</z:e> initiating myonecrosis but reflected the behavior of sarcotubular formation in the process of <z:mp ids='MP_0000750'>muscle regeneration</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
