<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two populations of muscle fibers were observed in each biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Besides muscle fibers with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or enlarged diameters there were frequently very small muscle cells indicating immaturity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most interesting findings in each biopsy were myofibroblast-like cells exhibiting active protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Large amounts of collagen fibrils with abnormal diameters as well as accumulation of elastic fibrils within the endomysium in CMD suggest abnormalities in collagen synthesis </plain></SENT>
