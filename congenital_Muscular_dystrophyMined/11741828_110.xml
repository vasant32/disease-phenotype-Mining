<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The limb girdle and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> (LGMD and CMD) are characterized by skeletal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000752'>dystrophic muscle</z:mp> changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms in CMD is within the first few months of life, whereas in LGMD they can occur in late childhood, adolescence or adult life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have recently demonstrated that the fukutin-related protein gene (FKRP) is mutated in a severe form of CMD (MDC1C), characterized by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002540'>inability to walk</z:hpo>, leg <z:hpo ids='HP_0003712'>muscle hypertrophy</z:hpo> and a secondary deficiency of laminin alpha2 and alpha-dystroglycan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both MDC1C and LGMD2I map to an identical region on chromosome 19q13.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether these are allelic disorders, we undertook mutation analysis of FKRP in 25 potential LGMD2I families, including some with a severe and early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutations were identified in individuals from 17 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A variable reduction of alpha-dystroglycan expression was observed in the skeletal muscle biopsy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, several cases showed a deficiency of laminin alpha2 either by immunocytochemistry or western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, affected individuals from 15 families had an identical C826A (Leu276Ileu) mutation, including five that were homozygous for this change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Linkage analysis identified at least two possible haplotypes in linkage disequilibrium with this mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with the C826A change had the clinically less severe LGMD2I phenotype, suggesting that this is a less disruptive FKRP mutation than those found in MDC1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The spectrum of LGMD2I phenotypes ranged from infants with an early presentation and a Duchenne-like disease course including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, to milder phenotypes compatible with a favourable long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
