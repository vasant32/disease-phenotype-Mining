<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mutations within the C-terminal region of the COL6A1 gene are only detected in Ullrich/Bethlem patients on extremely rare occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: Herein we report two Brazilian brothers with a classic Ullrich phenotype and compound heterozygous for two truncating mutations in COL6A1 gene, expected to result in the loss of the α1(VI) chain C2 subdomain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite the reduction in COL6A1 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> level due to nonsense <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> decay, three truncated alpha1 (VI) chains were produced as protein variants encoded by different out-of-frame transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Collagen VI matrix was severely decreased and intracellular protein retention evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The altered deposition of the fibronectin network highlighted abnormal interactions of the mutated collagen VI, lacking the α1(VI) C2 domain, within the extracellular matrix, focusing further studies on the possible role played by collagen VI in fibronectin deposition and organization </plain></SENT>
