<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the spectrum of muscle involvement on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in patients with collagen VI related disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients with genetically confirmed collagen VI related disorders, 10 with Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> and 9 with Ullrich <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD), had muscle MRI of their legs using T1 sequences through calves and thighs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> the vasti muscles appeared to be the most frequently and most strikingly affected thigh muscles, with a rim of abnormal signal at the periphery of each muscle and relative sparing of the central part </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another frequent finding was the presence of a peculiar involvement of the rectus femoris with a central area of abnormal signal within the muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with Ullrich CMD had a more diffuse involvement of the thigh muscles with relative sparing of sartorius, gracilis and adductor longus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 8 of the 9 patients with Ullrich CMD, we also observed the peripheral rim of the vastus lateralis and the central area in the rectus femoris observed in patients with Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At calf level the results were more variable but a significant proportion of patients with both Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (8/10) and Ullrich CMD (6/9) showed a rim of abnormal signal at the periphery of soleus and gastrocnemii </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> and Ullrich CMD patients have distinct patterns of muscle involvement on MRI with some overlap between the two forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that muscle <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> may be used, as an additional tool, to identify patients with collagen VI related disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This information is even more important in the patients with a typical Ullrich CMD clinical phenotype but with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> collagen expression of VI in muscle and/or skin </plain></SENT>
