<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the majority of the recessive UCMD cases have frameshift or nonsense mutations in COL6A1, COL6A2, or COL6A3, recessive structural mutations in the COL6A2 C-globular region are emerging also </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying molecular mechanisms have remained elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we identified a homozygous COL6A2 E624K mutation (C1 subdomain) and a homozygous COL6A2 R876S mutation (C2 subdomain) in two UCMD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The consequences of the mutations were investigated using fibroblasts from patients and cells stably transfected with the mutant constructs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to expectations based on the clinical severity of these two patients, secretion and assembly of collagen VI were moderately affected by the E624K mutation but severely impaired by the R876S substitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The E624K substitution altered the electrostatic potential of the region surrounding the metal ion-dependent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> site, resulting in a collagen VI network containing thick fibrils and spots with densely packed microfibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The R876S mutation prevented the chain from assembling into triple-helical collagen VI molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The minute amount of collagen VI secreted by the R876S fibroblasts was solely composed of a faster migrating chain corresponding to the C2a splice variant with an alternative C2 subdomain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In transfected cells, the C2a splice variant was able to assemble into short microfibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Together, the results suggest that the C2a splice variant may functionally compensate for the loss of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> COL6A2 chain when mutations occur in the C2 subdomain </plain></SENT>
