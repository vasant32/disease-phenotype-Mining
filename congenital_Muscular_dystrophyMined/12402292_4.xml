<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have demonstrated that collagen VI is deficient in the muscles of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ullrich's disease</z:e>, and some cases result from recessive mutations of the collagen VIalpha2 gene (COL6A2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fibronectin is one of the main components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and associates with a variety of other matrix molecules including collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The behavior of fibronectin on cells is mediated by fibronectin receptors, members of the integrin family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied the expression of fibronectin receptors and fibronectin in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ullrich's disease</z:e>, and found a marked reduction of fibronectin receptors in the ECM of skin and cultured fibroblasts of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that collagen VI deficiency may lead to the reduction of fibronectin receptors and that an abnormality of cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> may be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ullrich's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
