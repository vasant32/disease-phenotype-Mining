<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that the immunoreactivity of hematopoietic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi> synthase (HPGDS) appeared in necrotic muscle fibers, mainly in foci of grouped <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, in Duchenne's <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085655" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polymyositis</z:e> (PM), but not in Becker's <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> or in Fukuyama-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The HPGDS expression in DMD and PM was observed to be transient in hyalinated fibers at the early necrotic stage but not detected in opaque fibers, in fibers infiltrated by monocytes/lymphocyte, or in regenerating fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The immunoreactivities of a cytosolic form of phospholipase A(2) and cyclooxygenase-2, the upstream enzymes of the arachnoid acid cascade, were similarly observed in the HPGDS-positive fibers, suggesting that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi>(2) was produced in situ in those necrotic muscle fibers </plain></SENT>
