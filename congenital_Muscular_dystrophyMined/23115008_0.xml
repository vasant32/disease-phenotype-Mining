<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we discuss the importance of one type of glycosylation, specifically O-mannosylation and its relationship to a number of human diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most widely studied O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> modified protein is alpha-dystroglycan (α-DG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have focused intensely on α-DG due to the severity of diseases associated with its improper glycosylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>O-mannosylation of α-DG is involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, arenavirus entry, and multiple forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> [1, 2] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this review, we discuss the structural and functional characteristics of O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi>-initiated glycan structures on α-DG, enzymes involved in the O-mannosylation pathway, and the diseases that are a direct result of disruptions within this pathway </plain></SENT>
