<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Autophagy is crucial in the turnover of cell components, and clearance of damaged organelles by the autophagic-lysosomal pathway is essential for tissue homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Defects of this degradative system have a role in various diseases, but little is known about autophagy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> linked to collagen VI deficiency show dysfunctional mitochondria and spontaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, leading to myofiber degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that this persistence of abnormal organelles and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> are caused by defective autophagy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Skeletal muscles of collagen VI-knockout (Col6a1(-/-)) mice had impaired autophagic flux, which matched the lower induction of beclin-1 and BCL-2/adenovirus E1B-interacting protein-3 (Bnip3) and the lack of autophagosomes after starvation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forced activation of autophagy by genetic, dietary and pharmacological approaches restored myofiber survival and ameliorated the dystrophic phenotype of Col6a1(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, muscle biopsies from subjects with Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> or Ullrich <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> had reduced protein amounts of beclin-1 and Bnip3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that defective activation of the autophagic machinery is pathogenic in some <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
