<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The formation of glycosylated hydroxylysines is catalyzed by multifunctional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32568">lysyl</z:chebi> hydroxylase 3 (LH3) in vivo, and we have used LH3-manipulated mice and cells as models to study the function of these carbohydrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These hydroxylysine-linked carbohydrates were shown recently to be indispensable for the formation of basement membranes (Ruotsalainen, H., Sipilä, L., Vapola, M., Sormunen, R., Salo, A </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of LH3 knock-out embryos and cells in this work indicated that loss of glycosylated hydroxylysines prevents the intracellular tetramerization of type VI collagen and leads to impaired secretion of type IV and VI collagens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mice lacking the LH activity of LH3 produced slightly underglycosylated type IV and VI collagens with abnormal distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The altered distribution and aggregation of type VI collagen led to similar ultrastructural alterations in muscle to those detected in collagen VI knockout and some Ullrich <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results provide new information about the function of hydroxylysine-linked carbohydrates of collagens, indicating that they play an important role in the secretion, assembly, and distribution of highly glycosylated collagen types </plain></SENT>
