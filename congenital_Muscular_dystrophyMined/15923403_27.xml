<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently shown that overexpression of a miniaturized form of the molecule agrin (mini-agrin) counteracts the disease in dy(W)/dy(W) mice, a model for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, these mice express some residual truncated laminin-alpha2, suggesting that the observed amelioration might be due to mini-agrin's presenting the residual laminin-alpha2 to its receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we show that the mini-agrin counteracts the disease in dy(3K)/dy(3K) mice, which are null for laminin-alpha2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As in dy(W)/dy(W) mice, mini-agrin improves both the function and structure of muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show that <z:mp ids='MP_0000750'>muscle regeneration</z:mp> after injury is severely impaired in dy(3K)/dy(3K) mice but is restored in the mini-agrin-expressing littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In summary, our results 1) show that the direct linkage of muscle basal lamina with the sarcolemma is the basis of mini-agrin-mediated amelioration and 2) provide unprecedented evidence that this linkage is important for proper regeneration of muscle fibers after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings thus suggest that treatment with mini-agrin might be beneficial over the entire spectrum of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> disease, whose severity inversely correlates with expression levels and the size of the truncation in laminin-alpha2 </plain></SENT>
