<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The most common form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> is caused by a deficiency in the alpha2 chain of laminin-211, a protein of the extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A wide variety of mutations, including 20 to 30% of nonsense mutations, have been identified in the corresponding gene, LAMA2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A promising approach for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> due to premature termination codons (PTCs) is the use of drugs to force stop codon readthrough </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Here, we analyzed the effects of two compounds on a PTC in the LAMA2 gene that targets the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> to nonsense-mediated <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> decay, in vitro using a dual reporter assay, as well as ex vivo in patient-derived myotubes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We first showed that both gentamicin and negamycin promote significant readthrough of this PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then demonstrated that the mutant <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were strongly stabilized in patient-derived myotubes after administration of negamycin, but not gentamicin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, neither treatment allowed re-expression of the laminin alpha2-chain protein, pointing to problems that may have arisen at the translational or post-translational levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results emphasize that achievement of a clinical benefit upon treatment with novel readthrough-inducing agents would require several favourable conditions including PTC nucleotide context, intrinsic and induced stability of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and correct synthesis of a full-length active protein </plain></SENT>
