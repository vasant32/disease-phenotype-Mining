<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most striking feature was the <z:mp ids='MP_0001208'>blister</z:mp>-like swelling of vascular endothelial cells in the biopsied muscle specimens from 5 of the 6 patients with FCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Morphometric analysis of capillaries in biopsied muscles showed the extremely greater capillary, endothelial and pericyte areas in the FCMD patients than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These phenomena are quite similar to those found in Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD) at the preclinical stage and suggest an as yet undetermined process in blood vessels in FCMD as well as DMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An immunohistochemical study involving dystrophin antibodies showed positive staining in FCMD </plain></SENT>
