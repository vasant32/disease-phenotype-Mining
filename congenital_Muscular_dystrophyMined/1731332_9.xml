<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities of dystrophin, a cytoskeletal protein of muscle and nerve, are generally considered specific for Duchenne and Becker <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, several patients have recently been identified with dystrophin deficiency who, before dystrophin testing, were considered to have Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD) on the basis of clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Epidemiologic data suggest that only 1/3500 males with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> FCMD should have abnormal dystrophin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To explain the observation of 3/23 FCMD males with abnormal dystrophin, we propose that dystrophin and the FCMD gene product interact and that the earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and greater severity of these patients' phenotype (relative to Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>) are due to their being heterozygous for the FCMD mutation in addition to being hemizygous for Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, a genotype that is predicted to occur in 1/175,000 Japanese males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This model may help explain the genetic basis for some of the clinical and pathological variability seen among patients with FCMD, and it has potential implications for understanding the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> disorders in general </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For example, sex ratios for rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> disorders caused by mutations in proteins that interact with X chromosome-linked gene products may display predictable deviation from 1:1 </plain></SENT>
