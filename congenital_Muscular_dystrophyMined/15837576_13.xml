<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several lines of evidence suggest that the fukutin protein plays a pivotal role in synthesis of O-mannosyl sugar moieties of alpha-dystroglycan, a cell surface laminin receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, through targeted disruption of the orthologous mouse fukutin gene, we show that the fukutin protein is essential, as homozygous-null embryos die by E9.5 of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fukutin-null embryos show phenotypic diversity, features of which include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo>, folding of the egg cylinder, leakage of maternal red blood cells into the yolk sac cavity, and an increased number of apoptotic cells in the ectoderm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Loss of immunoreactivity against sugar moieties in alpha-dystroglycan suggests a reduced laminin-binding capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural analysis shows thin and breached basement membranes (BMs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BM fragility may underlie <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these abnormal phenotypes, and maintenance of BM function may require fukutin-mediated glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan early in embryonic development </plain></SENT>
