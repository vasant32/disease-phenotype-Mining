<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Study of 18 patients of 40 weeks' postmenstrual age to 4 years showed an apparent deficit in myelinisation in an infant with probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035920" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rubella</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embryopathy</z:e> and another with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> of unknown cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Abnormal scans were obtained in an infant with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, and abnormalities were visualised at the lateral ventricular margins in a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> after shunt blockage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Periventricular regions of increased T(2) were seen in a term infant aged 4 days after severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004045" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">birth asphyxia</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp>.Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging appears to provide a unique demonstration of myelinisation in vivo and shows changes in pathological processes of importance in paediatric practice </plain></SENT>
