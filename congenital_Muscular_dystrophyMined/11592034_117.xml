<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Structural brain defects, with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, are additional features of several CMD syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Approximately 40% of patients with CMD have a primary deficiency (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e>) of the laminin alpha2 chain of merosin (laminin-2) due to mutations in the LAMA2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, a secondary deficiency of laminin alpha2 is apparent in some CMD syndromes, including MDC1B, which is mapped to chromosome 1q42, and both muscle-eye-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> (MEB) and Fukuyama CMD (FCMD), two forms with severe brain involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The FCMD gene encodes a protein of unknown function, fukutin, though sequence analysis predicts it to be a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29315">phosphoryl</z:chebi>-ligand transferase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we identify the gene for a new member of the fukutin protein family (fukutin related protein [FKRP]), mapping to human chromosome 19q13.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We report the genomic organization of the FKRP gene and its pattern of tissue expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the FKRP gene have been identified in seven families with CMD characterized by disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in the first weeks of life and a severe phenotype with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002540'>inability to walk</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003712'>muscle hypertrophy</z:hpo>, marked elevation of serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain structure and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Affected individuals had a secondary deficiency of laminin alpha2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, they had both a marked decrease in immunostaining of muscle alpha-dystroglycan and a reduction in its molecular weight on western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We suggest these abnormalities of alpha-dystroglycan are caused by its defective glycosylation and are integral to the pathology seen in MDC1C </plain></SENT>
