<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Almost 50% of the cases are caused by primary deficiency of a protein named merosin (MD), and present a homogenous phenotype with a severe motor and respiratory involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven children with clinical and histological diagnosis of CMD-MD, aged of 3 to 15 years, were studied using the manual muscle testing (Medical Research Council), goniometric analysis, motor ability and day life activities (Barthel index) scales, with the objective to characterize the main motor function limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The muscular groups most affected were cervical flexors, paravertebral and proximal portions of limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The muscular groups of upper limbs were as affected as the lower limbs, and the extensors were more affected than the flexors groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children had severe muscular retractions on the hip, knee and elbow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other frequent deformities were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> and equinus-varum feet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No children presented the motor ability to walk, stand up and crawl; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them were classified as dependents or semi-dependents in the day life activities scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings confirm the severe and diffuse involvement of skeletal muscle in CMD-MD patients, producing serious motor limitations and deformities </plain></SENT>
