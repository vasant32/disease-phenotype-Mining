<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> patients often have feeding difficulty and need long-term enteral nutrition, only a few reports have described gastrostomy feeding in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of gastrostomy feeding in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective, multicenter study on 144 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> who received gastrostomy feeding between 2007 and 2009 in 25 neuromuscular centers in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 77 Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (median age at gastrostomy placement 26 years, range 13-47 years), 40 myotonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> (median age 54.5 years, range 13-70 years), 11 Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (median age 22 years, range 13-29 years), 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (median age 62 years, range 43-78 years), and 5 facioscapulohumeral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (median age 52 years, range 28-67 years) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Many benefits including amelioration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>swallowing difficulty</z:hpo> and respiratory status were observed after the introduction of gastrostomy feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Especially in patients with Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, mean body weight significantly increased after gastrostomy placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although most complications, which are commonly observed in other populations, were tolerable, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002586'>peritonitis</z:hpo> were important concerns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that gastrostomy placement at an appropriate time is advisable in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
