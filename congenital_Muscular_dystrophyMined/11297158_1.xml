<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intensity and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> scores were given to individual muscles by two radiologists and were calculated for three muscle groups (pelvic, anterior thigh and posterior thigh muscles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rectus femoris was affected less than the vastus muscles in 40 percent of cases in merosin-positive patients, whereas there was no selective sparing in merosin-deficient patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sartorius and gracilis were relatively spared in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most consistently affected muscles were gluteus maximus, adductor magnus and brevis in merosin-positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>Atrophy</z:mpath> was more prominent in the adductor muscles in the merosin-deficient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intensity scores of anterior thigh muscles of the merosin-positive group were significantly higher than those of the merosin-deficient group (U = 8, p = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When stepwise logistic regression model was applied, intensity score of the anterior thigh muscles was found to be the best differentiating variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The regression analysis model formed was able to differentiate the two forms with a sensitivity of 80 percent and specificity of 83 percent </plain></SENT>
