<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have undertaken an immunohistochemical study of laminin subunits in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) of fetuses and patients with Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD) and of controls including five fetuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunoreaction product deposits with antibodies to laminin alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1 and gamma 1, and beta-dystroglycan were detected on the surface and vessels of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No staining with anti-alpha-sarcoglycan antibody was detected in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurons and glia did not react with any of the antibodies used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In utero expression of laminin subunits and beta-dystroglycan seemed to be lower in the cerebrum than in the spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, immunostaining for laminin alpha 2 and beta 1 tended to be weak on the fetal spinal cord surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of laminin subunits and dystrophin-associated proteins in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> may be modulated during development, as in the skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The distribution of immunoreaction product deposits was basically the same in FCMD and controls, although laminin alpha 2 and beta-dystroglycan expression appeared to be decreased in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> of the FCMD cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Defects of the pial-glial barrier of the fetal brain surface have been considered the main cause of micropolygyria in FCMD, and these observations suggest that the co-localization and secondary loss of these proteins in association with the unknown product(s) of the FCMD gene might be involved in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> lesions of this disorder </plain></SENT>
