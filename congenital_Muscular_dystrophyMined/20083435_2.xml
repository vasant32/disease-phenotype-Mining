<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The attachment appears to play an important role in nematode development and, in some parasitic species, in immunomodulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This article considers the nature of the biosynthetic pathway of nematode PC-containing glycoconjugates and, in particular, the identity of the final component in the pathway - the enzyme that transfers PC to carbohydrate (the 'PC transferase') </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We offer the opinion that the PC transferase could be a member of the fukutin family (fukutin refers to the mutated gene product that causes Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>), a group of enzymes with apparent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29315">phosphoryl</z:chebi>-ligand transferase activity that are found in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans </plain></SENT>
