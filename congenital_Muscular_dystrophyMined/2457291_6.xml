<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Golgi and vascular impregnation methods were applied to the abnormal cerebral cortex in Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo> in FCMD has been categorized into three patterns by the degrees of cytoarchitectural abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>Cortical dysplasia</z:hpo> type 1 is characterized by the presence of verrucose nodules in the otherwise normally stratified cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By the Golgi method, many neurons at the top of the verrucose nodules showed abnormal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and dendritic orientation, while the rest of pyramidal neurons appeared relatively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A single 'central blood vessel' often penetrated vertically at the axis of the verrucose nodules, so that it was suggested that such nodules were formed around the long perforating blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In type 2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, or unlayered micropolygyria, individual cells showed relative paucity of lateral dendritic arborization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite mutual parallel alignment, neurons were often tilted in varying degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concentration of relatively large blood vessels was seen at the microsulci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the severest dysplastic pattern, or type 3 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, in addition to highly distorted cellular alignment, dendritic arborization of individual neurons were very poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cortical vasculature in type 3 consisted of two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> patterns; an extreme vascular distortion in the upper layer and a relatively well-preserved radial pattern in the deep layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The upper layer is supposed to represent the extra-cortical gliomesenchymal layer intermixed with neuronal clusters seen in the 23-week FCMD fetus we reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>By that fetal case analysis, we had hypothesized that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo> in FCMD has resulted from superficial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002282'>heterotopia</z:hpo> of migrating neurons related to diffuse proliferation of the extra-cortical gliomesenchymal tissue and focal or extensive defects of glia limitans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The abnormalities in cellular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, cellular alignment, and cortical vascular patterns shown in the present study seem to be compatible with our hypothesis </plain></SENT>
