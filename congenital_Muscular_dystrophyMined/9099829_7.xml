<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gene responsible for FCMD was mapped to chromosome 9q31, a region in which convincing evidence of strong linkage disequilibrium between FCMD and mfd220 (D9S306) was recently found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FCMD is also characterized clinically by a peak motor function which, at best, allows patients to sit unassisted or slide on the buttocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, a small fraction of patients acquire the capacity to walk unassisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whether such ambulant cases belong to the FCMD spectrum or to a different disease entity has been a topic of considerable debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We performed linkage analysis for ten families with ambulant cases using DNA markers flanking the FCMD locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mfd220 locus yielded a significant lod score of 3.09 for ambulant FCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also found evidence for linkage disequilibrium between ambulant FCMD and mfd220 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We further conducted haplotype analysis in FCMD siblings with different phenotypes, one of whom was ambulant while the other was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the FCMD siblings share exactly the same haplotype at nine marker loci spanning 23.3 cM surrounding the FCMD locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these results, we conclude that, genetically, ambulant cases are, in fact, part of the FCMD spectrum </plain></SENT>
