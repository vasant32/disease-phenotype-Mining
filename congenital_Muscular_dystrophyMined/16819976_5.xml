<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have focused on radial migration, which is disrupted at least in part due to breaks in the basal lamina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Through analysis of precerebellar nuclei development in the Large(myd) mouse hindbrain, we show that tangential migration of a subgroup of hindbrain neurons may also be disrupted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within the precerebellar nuclei, the pontine nuclei (PN) are severely disrupted, whereas the inferior olive (IO), external cuneate nuclei (ECN) and lateral reticular nuclei (LRN) appear unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Large and dystroglycan are widely expressed in the hindbrain, including in the pontine neurons migrating in the anterior extramural migratory stream (AES) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BrdU labeling and immunohistochemical studies suggest <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> numbers of neurons begin their journey towards the ventral midline in the AES in the Large(myd) mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, migration stalls and PN neurons fail to reach the midline, surviving as ectopic clusters of cells located under the pial surface dorsally and laterally to where they normally would finish their migration near the ventral midline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stalling of PN neurons at this location is also observed in other migration disorders in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that glycan-dependent dystroglycan interactions are required for PN neurons to correctly respond to signals at this important migrational checkpoint </plain></SENT>
