<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Laminin alpha2 deficiency presents at birth with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp>, and usually asymptomatic white matter signal on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few patients with laminin alpha2 deficiency have been described with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and structural brain abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The reason for the variation in the severity of the clinical phenotype in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) with laminin alpha2 deficiency is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A patient with CMD with partial laminin alpha2 presenting with brain structural abnormalities and untreatable generalized and partial complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Alternative laminin alpha2 splicing was studied by single-strand conformational polymorphism/sequencing analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A novel laminin alpha2 isoform was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nonsense laminin alpha2 mutations (stop codons) were inherited from both parents; however, one of the nonsense mutations was in a region of exon 31, which is alternatively spliced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The alternatively spliced isoform excluded one of the stop codon mutations, and was thus able to produce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> laminin alpha2 corresponding to this isoform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Laminin alpha2 immunofluorescence showed that this isoform was not evenly distributed at the muscle fiber basal lamina, but preferentially localized in discrete areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Laminin alpha5, beta1, gamma1, and nidogen showed decreased expression by immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The severity of this patient's phenotype may be due to overexpression of the exon 31-spliced laminin alpha2 isoform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Exon 31 lies in the IIIA domain of the laminin alpha2 protein, just proximal to the triple coil-coiled region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is possible that chain assembly is impaired by this isoform, resulting in a loss of possible rescue mechanisms </plain></SENT>
