<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Deficiency of laminin alpha2 is the cause of one of the most severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> in humans and other species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is not yet clear how particular mutations in the laminin alpha2 chain gene affect protein expression, and how abnormal levels or structure of the protein affect disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animal models may be valuable for such genotype-phenotype analysis and for determining mechanism of disease as well as function of laminin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we have analyzed protein expression in three lines of mice with mutations in the laminin alpha2 chain gene and in two lines of transgenic mice overexpressing the human laminin alpha2 chain gene in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dy(3K)/dy(3K) experimental mutant mice are completely deficient in laminin alpha2; the dy/dy spontaneous mutant mice have small amounts of apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> laminin; and the dy(W)/dy(W) mice express even smaller amounts of a truncated laminin alpha2, lacking domain VI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mutants lack laminin alpha2 in peripheral nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated previously, that overexpression of the human laminin alpha2 in skeletal muscle in dy(2J)/dy(2J) and dy(W)/dy(W) mice under the control of a striated muscle-specific <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase promoter substantially prevented the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> in these mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, dy(W)/dy(W) mice, expressing the human laminin alpha2 under the control of the striated muscle-specific portion of the desmin promoter, still developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This failure to rescue is apparently because of insufficient production of laminin alpha2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study provides additional evidence that the amount of laminin alpha2 is most critical for the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data may thus be of significance for attempts to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> in human patients </plain></SENT>
