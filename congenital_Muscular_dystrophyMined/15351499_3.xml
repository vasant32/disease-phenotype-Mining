<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although disruption of the intra-extra membrane linkage in the sarcolemma via the dystroglycan (DG) has been hypothesized as a possible underlying mechanism, little is known about the pathogenesis of brain anomalies in these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the patterns of expression of fukutin and alpha-DG in developing and adult mouse brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antisera against fukutin and alpha-DG identified neurons of the fetal cerebral and cerebellar cortex and the subpial pontine migratory stream </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In adult mice, fukutin and alpha-DG were extensively co-expressed in neurons of the cerebral and cerebellar cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia and olfactory bulb, as well as in the pontine nucleus and the cranial nerve nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results support the hypothesis that fukutin is involved in the glycosylation process of alpha-DG and that a defect in this process plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of FCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further research into the physiological function of alpha-DG in migrating and mature neurons is required </plain></SENT>
