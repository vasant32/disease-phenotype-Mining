<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have analysed collagen VI expression in 14 UCMD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of COL6A genes had identified homozygous and heterozygous mutations in 12 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of collagen VI in fibroblast cultures derived from eight of these patients showed reduced extracellular deposition in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases and intracellular collagen VI staining in seven cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was observed even in cases that showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> collagen VI labelling in skin biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Collagen VI immunolabelling was reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the available muscle biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When comparisons were possible no correlation was seen between the extent of the reduction in the muscle and fibroblast cultures, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> or the severity of the clinical phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutations affecting glycine substitutions in the conserved triple helical domain were common and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> resulted in reduced collagen VI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study expands the spectrum of collagen VI defects and shows that analysis of skin fibroblasts may be a useful technique for the detection of collagen VI abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, immunohistochemical analysis of skin biopsies may not always reveal an underlying collagen VI defect </plain></SENT>
