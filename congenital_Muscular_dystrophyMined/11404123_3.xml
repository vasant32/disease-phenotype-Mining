<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a child who presented at birth with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002804'>arthrogryposis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following a muscle biopsy a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> was made and a skin biopsy 12 years later confirmed the presence of merosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Her clinical picture was unusual, however, for merosin-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She had extreme <z:mp ids='MP_0005150'>wasting</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of her arms and legs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, she had good neck and trunk control, and no facial or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002747'>respiratory muscle weakness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have used magnetic resonance imaging to examine the pattern of muscle involvement in this case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No recognizable muscle could be identified in the limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the axial muscles were preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This striking pattern of virtual absence of muscles in the limbs with sparing of the axial muscle suggests that a gene responsible for the migration and/or proliferation of limb muscle precursor cells may be involved in the disease process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is recognized that merosin-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging is a useful tool for examining in detail the pattern of muscle involvement and identifying individual phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Understanding more about which muscles are affected in children with congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> may provide information on the underlying <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath> and help in the search for candidate proteins and genes </plain></SENT>
