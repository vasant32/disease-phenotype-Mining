<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cardiac ankyrin-repeated protein (CARP) has been shown to associate with a transcription factor, YB-1, that may activate expression of the ventricular myosin light chain-2 gene during cardiogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CARP is induced in the adult hypertrophic heart subjected to pressure overload, suggesting that CARP may play important functional roles in both embryonic and adult hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although CARP expression was initially believed to be restricted to the heart, we found recently that CARP is induced strongly in human fetal skeletal muscle and in experimentally denervated skeletal muscle, leading us to speculate that CARP may also play important roles in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we found that in rats initially damaged by a single injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3215">bupivacaine</z:chebi>, CARP expression was induced strongly in regenerating muscles with a peak 3 days after the injection, followed by down-regulation to undetectable levels after 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although CARP was coexpressed with embryonic myosin heavy chain (MHC) in regenerating myofibers, CARP expression persisted even after down-regulation of embryonic MHC expression, whereas it began to decrease before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of slow or fast MHC expression, suggesting that CARP is expressed at a specific differentiation stage during <z:mp ids='MP_0000750'>muscle regeneration</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the expression of CARP in muscle biopsy specimens from 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (MD) and detected high expression of CARP in 13 of the 14 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CARP-positive myofibers were detected more often in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) than in Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that CARP was expressed exclusively, and at a high level, in small regenerating myofibers that express embryonic MHC in DMD, which suggested that CARP could be used as a marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0000750'>muscle regeneration</z:mp> in DMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in CMD, expression of CARP was not limited to regenerating fibers, being detectable in myofibers expressing embryonic MHC and those expressing mature-type MHC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the differentiation stage of CARP-positive myofibers in DMD and CMD may differ </plain></SENT>
