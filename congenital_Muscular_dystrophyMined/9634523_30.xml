<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous reports have documented either <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>modes of inheritance</z:hpo>, with genetic linkage studies providing evidence for the existence of at least 12 distinct loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gene products have been identified for five genes responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> forms of the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed a genome scan using pooled DNA from a large Hutterite kindred in which the affected members display a mild form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> LGMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 200 markers were used to screen pools of DNA from patients and their siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Linkage between the LGMD locus and D9S302 (maximum LOD score 5.99 at recombination fraction .03) was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since this marker resides within the chromosomal region known to harbor the gene causing Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD), we expanded our investigations, to include additional markers in chromosome region 9q31-q34.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis revealed five recombinations that place the LGMD locus distal to the FCMD locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The LGMD locus maps close to D9S934 (maximum multipoint LOD score 7.61) in a region that is estimated to be approximately 4.4 Mb (Genetic Location Database composite map) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the basis of an inferred ancestral recombination, the gene may lie in a 300-kb region between D9S302 and D9S934 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results provide compelling evidence that yet another gene is involved in LGMD; we suggest that it be named "<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LGMD2H</z:e>." </plain></SENT>
