<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates whether abnormalities of visual function are present in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and whether these, if present, are associated with merosin status or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty children (age range 5-17 years) with a diagnosis of classical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> were assessed on visual acuity, stereopsis, and visual fields and the results compared with merosin status and MRI findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Visual-evoked potential results were available for 14 of 20 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 20 children revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> results on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the clinical tests assessing visual function, irrespective of their merosin status or of MRI findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Visual-evoked potentials were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the children with merosin-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> but were abnormal in those with merosin deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unlike the other forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, which are associated with structural brain changes and eye involvement, visual function was always <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the classical form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, visual function was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> also in the group of children with merosin-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> who manifested white matter changes involving the occipital lobes on MRI and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000649'>abnormal visual evoked potentials</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to specify the nature of the white matter changes observed with MRI and the reason for the dissociation between clinical and neurophysiologic findings </plain></SENT>
