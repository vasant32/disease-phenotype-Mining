<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Outside Japan, FKTN mutations have only been reported in a few patients with a wide spectrum of phenotypes from Walker-Warburg syndrome to <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (LGMD2M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied four new Caucasian patients from three unrelated families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> showed raised serum CK initially isolated in one case and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies and haplotype analysis led us to search for mutations in FKTN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients (two sisters) presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, and posterior fossa malformation including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath>, and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> at Brain MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other two patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intelligence and brain MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of the FKTN gene identified three previously described mutations and two novel missense mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Outside Japan, fukutinopathies are associated with a large spectrum of phenotypes from isolated hyperCKaemia to severe CMD, showing a clear overlap with that of FKRP </plain></SENT>
