<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Dystroglycan is a central component of the dystrophin-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> complex that links the extracellular matrix with cytoskeleton </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, mutations of the genes encoding putative glycosyltransferases were identified in several forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> accompanied by brain anomalies and eye abnormalities, and aberrant glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan has been implicated in their pathogeneses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These diseases are now collectively called alpha-dystroglycanopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrate that peripheral nerve myelination is defective in the fukutin-deficient chimeric mice, a mouse model of Fukuyama-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, which is the most common alpha-dystroglycanopathy in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the peripheral nerve of these mice, the density of myelinated nerve fibers was significantly decreased and clusters of abnormally large non-myelinated axons were ensheathed by a single Schwann cell, indicating a defect of the radial sorting mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sugar chain moiety and laminin-binding activity of alpha-dystroglycan were severely reduced, while the expression of beta1-integrin was not altered in the peripheral nerve of the chimeric mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also show that the clustering of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> receptor is defective and neuromuscular junctions are fragmented in appearance in these mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of agrin and laminin as well as the binding activity of alpha-dystroglycan to these ligands was severely reduced at the neuromuscular junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that fukutin plays crucial roles in the myelination of peripheral nerve and formation of neuromuscular junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They also suggest that defective glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan may play a role in the impairment of these processes in the deficiency of fukutin </plain></SENT>
