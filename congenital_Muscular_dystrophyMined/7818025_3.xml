<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the probability of cardiac muscle involvement in 25 patients with CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular dimensions, wall thicknesses and function were investigated by M-mode and Doppler echocardiography in patients and healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The M-mode echocardiographic data were similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the left ventricular mass index in the study group was significantly lower than that of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular diastolic function also differed significantly when compared with that of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mild diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle might precede manifestations of probable cardiac muscle involvement or subclinical cardiac involvement </plain></SENT>
