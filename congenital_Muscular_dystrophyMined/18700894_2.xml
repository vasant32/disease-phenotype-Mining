<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe the molecular study of 26 patients with clinical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging and/or laminin-alpha2 expression in muscle, compatible with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The combination of full genomic sequencing and complementary DNA analysis led to the particularly high mutation detection rate of 96% (50/52 disease alleles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Besides 22 undocumented polymorphisms, 18 different mutations were identified in the course of this work, 14 of which were novel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In particular, we describe the first fully characterized gross deletion in the LAMA2 gene, encompassing exon 56 (c.7750-1713_7899-2153del), detected in 31% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The only two missense mutations detected were found in heterozygosity with nonsense or truncating mutations in the two patients with the milder clinical presentation and a partial reduction in muscle laminin-alpha2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results corroborate the previous few genotype/phenotype correlations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> and illustrate the importance of screening for gross rearrangements in the LAMA2 gene, which may be underestimated in the literature </plain></SENT>
