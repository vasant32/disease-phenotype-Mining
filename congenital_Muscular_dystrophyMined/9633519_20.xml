<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To establish a defined model for in vitro and in vivo studies of the role of laminin alpha 2/merosin in development and cell and tissue function, we generated several lines of mutant embryonic stem (ES) cell with disruption of the laminin alpha 2 chain gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We find that homozygous mutant ES cells differentiate normally in vitro, giving rise to cardiomyocytes, myotubes, and smooth muscle cells in addition to many other cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the myotubes that are formed are unstable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They detach, collapse, and degenerate, a process which is initiated at the appearance of the mature, contractile phenotype of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We propose that the detachment and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of contracting myotubes in vitro has its counterpart in vivo and that contraction-induced myofiber damage, along with the lack of survival cues provided by laminin alpha 2/merosin, is a significant contribution to <z:mp ids='MP_0000749'>muscle degeneration</z:mp> in merosin-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
