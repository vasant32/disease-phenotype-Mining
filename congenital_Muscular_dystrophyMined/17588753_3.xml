<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ColVI defect is generally related to COL6 genes mutations, however UCDM patients without COL6 mutations have been recently reported, suggesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report comparative morphological findings between a UCMD patient harboring a homozygous COL6A2 mutation and a patient with a typical UCMD phenotype in which mutations in COL6 genes were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient with no mutations in COL6 genes exhibited a partial ColVI defect, which was only detected close to the basal membrane of myofibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We describe how confocal microscopy and rotary-shadowing electron microscopy may be useful to identify a secondary ColVI defect </plain></SENT>
