<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have isolated a human gene homologous to Drosophila melanogaster rotated abdomen, rt, a poorly viable recessive mutation causing a clockwise twisted abdomen in affected flies due to defects in embryonic muscle development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The human gene, like rt, encodes a protein with high homology to the yeast mannosyl-transferases (Pmts) and has been named POMT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>POMT1 is expressed as a 3.1-kb transcript in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tissues tested, with highest levels in testis and fetal brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Alternative splicing of several exons in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tissues predicts the generation of several protein isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> variant encodes a 725-aa protein with 40% identity and 62.5% similarity to rt, as well as 30.5% identity and 54% similarity to yeast Pmts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computer prediction of protein sorting suggests that the POMT1 product could be an integral protein of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Given the strong conservation of protein motifs between POMT1 and the yeast Pmts, POMT1 may function as a mannosyl-transferase involved in O-mannosylation of proteins, being the first of such a class found in mammals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The POMT1 locus has been assigned to human chromosome 9q34.1 by somatic cell hybrids, radiation hybrids, and linkage analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the rt phenotype, POMT1 could be a candidate for uncharacterized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> of the muscular system, such as some forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> or congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
