<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TGF-beta1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in skeletal muscle from laminin alpha2-negative and laminin alpha2-positive CMD patients were significantly greater than in controls (P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.005, respectively), while in partial laminin alpha2-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> patients the amount was not significantly higher than in controls (P &gt; 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The TGF-beta1 values were lower than those found in DMD, although the extent of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> was greater in CMD than in DMD and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that TGF-beta1 is involved in CMD muscle <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, but differently from what we observed in DMD muscles as it seems not to be the major player in connective tissue proliferation </plain></SENT>
