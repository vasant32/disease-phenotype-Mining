<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By taking advantages of the presence of a consanguineous patient with both FCMD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043346" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">xeroderma pigmentosum</z:e> group A, we performed homozygosity mapping using consanguineous FCMD families mainly, and localized the FCMD locus to chromosome 9q31-33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, we have identified the gene responsible for FCMD on 9q31, which encodes a novel 461-amino-acid protein termed fukutin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most FCMD-bearing chromosomes are derived from a single ancestral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> (87%), and a 3kb-retrotransposal insertion was found to be a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two independent point mutations in this gene have also been detected on chromosomes carrying the non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FCMD is the first human disease to be caused by an ancient retrotransposal integration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We further identified the gene for muscle-eye-brain (MEB) disease, which encodes POMGnT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have revealed that posttranslational modification of alpha-dystroglycan is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> with brain malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since hypoglycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan is common amongst several other disorders, a new clinical entity called alpha-dystroglycanopathy is proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, only POMGnT1 (MEB) and POMT1 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e>) are shown to have a definite enzymatic activity, and no enzymatic activity has been detected in fukutin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We show positive interactions between fukutin and POMGnT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fukutin may form a protein complex with POMGnT1 and modulate POMGnT1's enzymatic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Through cDNA microarray, we also show aberrant neuromuscular junction formation and delayed muscle fiber maturation in alpha-dystroglycanopathies, suggesting a new pathomechanism </plain></SENT>
