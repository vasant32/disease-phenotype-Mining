<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously mapped the FCMD gene to a region of less than 100 kilobases which included the marker locus D9S2107 on chromosome 9q31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have also described a haplotype that is shared by more than 80% of FCMD chromosomes, indicating that most chromosomes bearing the FCMD mutation could be derived from a single ancestor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we report that there is a retrotransposal insertion of tandemly repeated sequences within this candidate-gene interval in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> FCMD chromosomes carrying the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> haplotype (87%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inserted sequence is about 3 kilobases long and is located in the 3' untranslated region of a gene encoding a new 461-amino-acid protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This gene is expressed in various tissues in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals, but not in FCMD patients who carry the insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two independent point mutations confirm that mutation of this gene is responsible for FCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The predicted protein, which we term fukutin, contains an amino-terminal signal sequence, which together with results from transfection experiments suggests that fukutin is a secreted protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, FCMD is the first human disease to be caused by an ancient retrotransposal integration </plain></SENT>
