<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Mutations in COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3, the genes that encode the extracellular matrix component collagen VI, lead to Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (BM) and Ullrich <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (UCMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unlike UCMD, BM is difficult to diagnose because of its clinical overlap with other contractural phenotypes and the lack of sensitivity of standard muscle biopsy immunohistochemical diagnostic techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We appraised two potential techniques for the diagnosis of BM: dual immunofluorescence (IF) for collagen VI and basal lamina-located perlecan in muscle, and immunofluorescent labeling of collagen VI in skin biopsy-derived fibroblast cultures, which was conducted in 40 patients by blinded investigators and correlated with genetic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dual IF was indistinguishable from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls in most BM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, abnormalities in the IF labeling pattern of collagen VI were detected in more than 78% of genetically confirmed BM patient fibroblast cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, in a group of patients with unknown diagnosis studied prospectively, the fibroblast IF technique was highly predictive of the presence of a COL6A mutation, providing a positive predictive value of 75%, a sensitivity and negative predictive value of 100%, and a specificity of 63% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Immunofluorescent labeling of collagen VI in fibroblast cultures is a useful addition to current diagnostic services for Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (BM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It can be used to guide molecular genetic testing, the gold standard diagnostic technique for BM, in a cost-effective and time-saving manner </plain></SENT>
