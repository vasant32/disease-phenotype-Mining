<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> cases arise from laminin alpha2 (merosin) deficiency, and merosin-deficient mice (Lama2dy) exhibit a dystrophic phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The abnormal development of thymus in Lama2dy mice, the occurrence of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the gland and the impaired distribution of AChE molecules in skeletal muscle of the mouse mutant prompted us to compare the levels of AChE <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> and enzyme species in thymus of control and Lama2dy mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AChE activity in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> thymus (mean +/- SD 1.42 +/- 0.28 micromol acetylthiocholine/h/mg protein, U/mg) was decreased by approximately 50% in dystrophic thymus (0.77 +/- 0.23 U/mg) (p = 0.007), whereas butyrylcholinesterase activity was little affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR assays revealed variable levels of R, H and T AChE <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> in thymus, bone marrow and spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control thymus contained amphiphilic AChE dimers (G2A, 64%) and monomers (G1A, 19%), as well as hydrophilic tetramers (G4H, 9%) and monomers (G1H, 8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dimers consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24410">glycosylphosphatidylinositol</z:chebi>-anchored H subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blot assays with anti-AChE antibodies suggested the occurrence of inactive AChE in mouse thymus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite the decrease in AChE activity in Lama2dy thymus, no differences between thymuses from control and dystrophic mice were observed in the distribution of AChE forms, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C sensitivity, binding to lectins and size of AChE subunits </plain></SENT>
