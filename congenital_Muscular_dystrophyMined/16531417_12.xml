<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have revealed an association between post-translational modification of alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG) and certain <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> known as secondary alpha-dystroglycanopathies (alpha-DGpathies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fukuyama-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD) is classified as a secondary alpha-DGpathy because the responsible gene, fukutin, is a putative glycosyltransferase for alpha-DG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the pathophysiology of secondary alpha-DGpathies, we profiled gene expression in skeletal muscle from FCMD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>cDNA microarray analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that expression of developmentally regulated genes, including myosin heavy chain (MYH) and myogenic transcription factors (MRF4, myogenin and MyoD), in FCMD muscle fibers is inconsistent with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> and active <z:mp ids='MP_0000750'>muscle regeneration</z:mp>, instead more of implicating maturational arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FCMD skeletal muscle contained mainly immature type 2C fibers positive for immature-type MYH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These characteristics are distinct from Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, suggesting that another mechanism in addition to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> accounts for the FCMD skeletal muscle lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis revealed morphologically aberrant neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) lacking MRF4 co-localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hypoglycosylated alpha-DG indicated a lack of aggregation, and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> receptor (AChR) clustering was compromised in FCMD and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026850" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">myodystrophy</z:e> mouse, another model of secondary alpha-DGpathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy showed aberrant NMJs and neural terminals, as well as myotubes with maturational defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Functional analysis of NMJs of alpha-DGpathy showed decreased miniature endplate potential and higher sensitivities to d-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9774">Tubocurarine</z:chebi>, suggesting aberrant or collapsed formation of NMJs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because alpha-DG aggregation and subsequent clustering of AChR are crucial for NMJ formation, hypoglycosylation of alpha-DG results in aberrant NMJ formation and delayed muscle terminal maturation in secondary alpha-DGpathies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although severe necrotic degeneration or <z:mp ids='MP_0005150'>wasting</z:mp> of skeletal muscle fibers is the main cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophies</z:hpo>, maturational delay of muscle fibers also underlies the etiology of secondary alpha-DGpathies </plain></SENT>
