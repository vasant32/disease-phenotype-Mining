<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histochemical and histological study of muscle indicated that 11 cases were of myogenic origin, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> in 10 cases from six families and nemaline rod <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurogenic causation was established in five cases, including three with intra-uterine anoxic-ischaemic damage and two siblings with a severe form of cerebro-ocular-facio-skeletal syndrome </plain></SENT>
