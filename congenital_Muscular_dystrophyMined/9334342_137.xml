<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about how alterations in the DGC are manifested in the pathophysiology present in <z:mp ids='MP_0000752'>dystrophic muscle</z:mp> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hypothesis is that the DGC protects the sarcolemma from contraction-induced damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using tracer molecules, we compared sarcolemmal integrity in animal models for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> patient samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Evans blue, a low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30105">diazo</z:chebi> dye, does not cross into skeletal muscle fibers in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, mdx mice, a dystrophin-deficient animal model for Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, showed significant Evans blue accumulation in skeletal muscle fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also studied Evans blue dispersion in transgenic mice bearing different dystrophin mutations, and we demonstrated that cytoskeletal and sarcolemmal attachment of dystrophin might be a necessary requirement to prevent serious fiber damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The extent of dye incorporation in transgenic mice correlated with the phenotypic severity of similar dystrophin mutations in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We furthermore assessed Evans blue incorporation in skeletal muscle of the dystrophia muscularis (dy/dy) mouse and its milder allelic variant, the dy2J/dy2J mouse, animal models for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, these mice, which have defects in the laminin alpha2-chain, an extracellular ligand of the DGC, showed little Evans blue accumulation in their skeletal muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that the pathogenic mechanisms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> are different from those in Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, although the primary defects originate in two components associated with the same protein complex </plain></SENT>
