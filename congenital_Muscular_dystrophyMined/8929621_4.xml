<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A particular form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> with merosin deficiency has recently been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging has shown that affected children show brain abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigate the localization of merosin in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human brain by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other organs, such as the kidney, lung and liver, were also included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system merosin is localized in the basement membrane of blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No expression of merosin was found at the level of the liver and lungs, whereas the glomerular mesangial matrix of the kidney was intensely positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that merosin deficiency in the basement membrane of blood vessels in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system could play an important role in the physiopathology of brain abnormalities found in children affected by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> associated with merosin deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the potential absence of merosin in the glomerular mesangial matrix of the kidney suggests a multi-system involvement </plain></SENT>
