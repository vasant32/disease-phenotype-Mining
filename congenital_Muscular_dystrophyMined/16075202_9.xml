<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recessive mutations in two of the three collagen VI genes, COL6A2 and COL6A3, have been identified in eight of the nine UCMD patients reported thus far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A heterozygous COL6A1 gene deletion, resulting in a mutant protein that exerts a dominant negative effect, has recently been described in a severely affected UCMD patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a patient in whom reverse transcription-PCR analysis of fibroblast <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> suggested a heterozygous in-frame deletion of exon 13 in the triple-helical domain of COL6A2, which is predicted to be dominantly acting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, a homozygous A --&gt; G mutation at -10 of intron 12 was found in the genomic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The intron mutation activated numerous cryptic splice acceptor sites, generating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and exon 13-deleted COL6A2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, and multiple aberrant transcripts containing frameshifts that were degraded through a nonsense-mediated decay mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Northern analysis indicated diminished COL6A2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression as the primary pathogenic mechanism in this UCMD patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results underscore the importance of multifaceted analyses in the accurate molecular diagnosis and interpretation of genotype-phenotype correlations of UCMD </plain></SENT>
