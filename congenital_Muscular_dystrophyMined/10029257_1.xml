<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies of Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> have focused on abnormalities of the basement membrane in muscle and brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cerebral cortex has a unique basement membrane at the glia limitans, which is intimately related to astrocytes in the developing brain, and the basement membrane may be partially produced by the astrocyte </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study the cerebral astrocytes in six patients with Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, including two fetal patients, were characterized by immunohistochemical study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In fetal Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, astrocytes reacted less to antibodies of glial fibrillary acidic protein, S-100 protein, and alphaB-crystallin than control astrocytes, but in postnatal Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, astrocytes reacted more to these antibodies and displayed beading of processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, vimentin was positive in the astrocytes of two postnatal Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This astrocytic appearance may suggest immaturity of astrocytes in Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Astrocytes exhibiting beaded cytoplasmic processes were prominent at the subpia of the cortex and around vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors hypothesize that these immature astrocytes are unable to participate in the function of the cortical basement membrane, which is defective in Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Studies of neurons and meninges were similar to those of control subjects </plain></SENT>
