<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The integrins are a large family of heterodimeric transmembrane cellular receptors which mediate the association between the extracellular matrix (ECM) and cytoskeletal proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The alpha7beta1 integrin is a major laminin binding integrin in skeletal and cardiac muscle and is thought to be involved in myogenic differentiation and migration processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main binding partners of the alpha7 integrin are laminin-1 (alpha1-beta1-gamma1), laminin-2 (alpha2-beta1-gamma1) and laminin-4 (alpha2-beta2-gamma1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Targeted deletion of the gene for the alpha7 integrin subunit (ITGA7) in mice leads to a novel form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study we have investigated the expression of two alternative splice variants, the alpha7B and beta1D integrin subunits, in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human skeletal muscle, as well as in various forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human skeletal muscle the expression of the alpha7 integrin subunit appeared to be developmentally regulated: it was first detected at 2 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the beta1D integrin could be detected in immature and mature muscle in the sarcolemma of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fetal skeletal muscle at 18 weeks gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of alpha7B integrin was significantly reduced at the sarcolemma in six patients with laminin alpha2 chain deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) (age &gt;2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, this reduction was not correlated with the amount of laminin alpha2 chain expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the expression of the laminin alpha2 chain was not altered in the skeletal muscle of the alpha7 knock-out mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data argue in favor that there is not a tight correlation between the expression of the alpha7 integrin subunit and that of the laminin alpha2 chain in either human or murine <z:mp ids='MP_0000752'>dystrophic muscle</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in dystrophinopathies (Duchenne and Becker <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>; DMD/BMD) expression of alpha7B was upregulated irrespective of the level of dystrophin expression as shown by a strong sarcolemmal staining pattern even in young boys (age &lt;2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The expression of the beta1D integrin subunit was not altered in any of our patients with different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In contrast, sarcolemmal expression of beta1D integrin was significantly reduced in the alpha7 integrin knock-out mice, whereas the expression of the components of the DGC was not altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The secondary loss of alpha7B in laminin alpha2 chain deficiency defines a biochemical change in the composition of the plasma membrane resulting from a primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033626" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein deficiency</z:e> in the basal lamina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These findings, in addition to the occurrence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> in alpha7 deficient mice, implies that the alpha7B integrin is an important laminin receptor within the plasma membrane which plays a significant role in skeletal muscle function and stability </plain></SENT>
