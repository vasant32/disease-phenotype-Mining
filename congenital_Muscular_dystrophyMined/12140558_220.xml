<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The FCMD gene, fukutin, shares some homology with fringe-like glycosyltransferases, and the MEB gene, POMGnT1, seems to be a new glycosyltransferase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show, in both MEB and FCMD patients, that alpha-dystroglycan is expressed at the muscle membrane, but similar hypoglycosylation in the diseases directly abolishes binding activity of dystroglycan for the ligands laminin, neurexin and agrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that this post-translational biochemical and functional disruption of alpha-dystroglycan is recapitulated in the muscle and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system of mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026850" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">myodystrophy</z:e> (myd) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that myd mice have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002269'>abnormal neuronal migration</z:hpo> in cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus, and show disruption of the basal lamina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, myd mice reveal that dystroglycan targets proteins to functional sites in brain through its interactions with extracellular matrix proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that at least three distinct mammalian genes function within a convergent post-translational processing pathway during the biosynthesis of dystroglycan, and that abnormal dystroglycan-ligand interactions underlie the pathogenic mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> with brain abnormalities </plain></SENT>
