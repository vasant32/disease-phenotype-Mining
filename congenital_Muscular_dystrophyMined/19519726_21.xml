<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We have investigated the therapeutic effects of the selective cyclophilin inhibitor D-MeAla(3)-EtVal(4)-cyclosporin (Debio 025) in myopathic Col6a1(-/-) mice, a model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> due to defects of collagen VI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We studied calcineurin activity based on NFAT translocation; T cell activation based on expression of CD69 and CD25; propensity to open the permeability transition pore in mitochondria and skeletal muscle fibres based on the ability to retain Ca(2+) and on membrane potential, respectively; muscle ultrastructure by electronmicroscopy; and apoptotic rates by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labelling assays in Col6a1(-/-) mice before after treatment with Debio 025 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: Debio 025 did not inhibit calcineurin activity, yet it desensitizes the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> permeability transition pore in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment with Debio 025 prevented the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction and normalized the apoptotic rates and ultrastructural lesions of myopathic Col6a1(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICAtions: Desensitization of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> permeability transition pore can be achieved by selective inhibition of matrix cyclophilin D without inhibition of calcineurin, resulting in an effective therapy of Col6a1(-/-) myopathic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings provide an important proof of principle that collagen VI <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> can be treated with Debio 025 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They represent an essential step towards an effective therapy for Ullrich <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>Congenital Muscular Dystrophy</z:hpo> and Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>Myopathy</z:hpo>, because Debio 025 does not expose patients to the potentially harmful effects of immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
