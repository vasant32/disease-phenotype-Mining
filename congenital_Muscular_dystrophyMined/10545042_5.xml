<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite the recent advance in genetic study of Fukuyama-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD), the mechanism of <z:mp ids='MP_0000749'>muscle degeneration</z:mp> in the disease remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify it, muscle biopsies from six cases of FCMD were subjected to immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the muscle cell surface, decreased expression of laminin alpha2 subunit was seen along with aberrant expression of laminin alpha5 and neural cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy revealed breach of muscle basal lamina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The electron density of plasma membrane was significantly lower at the places without identifiable basal lamina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus in FCMD changes of laminin and other proteins on the cell surface involve a process common to developing muscles, and loss of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> structure of the basal lamina is closely associated with changes of the plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the primary cause of FCMD is related to formation and maintenance of the basal lamina </plain></SENT>
