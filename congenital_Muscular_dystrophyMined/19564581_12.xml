<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the course, complications, and prognosis of Ullrich <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (UCMD), with special reference to life-changing events, including loss of ambulation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory insufficiency</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Review of the case notes of 13 patients with UCMD, aged 15 years or older at last visit, followed up at a tertiary neuromuscular centre, London, UK, from 1977 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data collected were age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms, presenting symptoms, mobility, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002096'>skin abnormalities</z:mp>, respiratory function, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011968'>feeding difficulties</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms was 12 months (SD 14 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (61.5%) acquired independent ambulation at a mean age of 1.7 years (SD 0.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (69.2%) became constant wheelchair users at a mean age of 11.1 years (SD 4.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients continued to ambulate indoors with assistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forced vital capacity (FVC) values were abnormal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients from age 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean FVC (% predicted) declined at a mean rate of 2.6% (SD 4.1%) yearly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (69.2%) started noninvasive ventilation at a mean age of 14.3 years (SD 5.0 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In Ullrich <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (UCMD), the decline in motor and respiratory functions is more rapid in the first decade of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The deterioration is invariable, but not always correlated with age or severity at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This information should be of help to better anticipate the difficulties encountered by patients with UCMD and in planning future therapeutic trials in this condition </plain></SENT>
