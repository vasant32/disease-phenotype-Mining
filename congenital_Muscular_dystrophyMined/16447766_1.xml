<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously identified the genes for FCMD and MEB, which encode fukutin and POMGnT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have revealed that posttranslational modification of alpha-dystroglycan is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> with brain malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since hypoglycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan is common amongst several other disorders, a new clinical entity called alpha-dystroglycanopathy is proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, only POMGnT1 (MEB) and POMT1 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e>) are shown to have a definite enzymatic activity, and no enzymatic activity has been detected in fukutin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show positive interactions between fukutin and POMGnT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fukutin may form a protein complex with POMGnT1 and modulate POMGnT1's enzymatic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Through cDNA microarray, we also show aberrant neuromuscular junction formation and delayed muscle fiber maturation in alpha-dystroglycanopathies, suggesting a new pathomechanism </plain></SENT>
