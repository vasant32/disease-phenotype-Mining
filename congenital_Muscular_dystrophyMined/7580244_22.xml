<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The expression of laminin subunits M, A, B1 and B2 was studied immunocytochemically in 25 cases of classical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD), 11 hypotonic infants, 20 cases of a variety of inherited and acquired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852419,C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular disorders</z:e>, and 11 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Merosin, as indicated by labelling for the M chain, was deficient in 12 (48%) of the cases of classical CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven cases had no detectable labelling for the M chain whereas five showed traces, including three cousins from the same family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This suggests that very low expression may relate to a possible difference in the molecular defect, compared with cases completely devoid of the M chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The A chain was abundant in regenerating fibres and in immature fibres expressing fetal myosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> merosin-deficient cases the A chain was over-expressed but this was not due to immaturity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A secondary reduction in sarcolemmal expression of the B1 chain occurred in five merosin-deficient cases, whilst expression in vascular tissue was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>B1 was also reduced in one merosin-positive case of CMD, suggesting that other subunits may be involved in other forms of CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No differences in the expression of the B2 chain were observed in any of the cases studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No abnormality in laminin subunits was found in controls or other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852419,C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
