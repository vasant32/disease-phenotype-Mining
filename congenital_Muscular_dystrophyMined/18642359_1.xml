<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that the binding ability of mutated collagen VI to extracellular matrix was markedly reduced compared to control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This indicates that heterozygous mutations in COL6 genes diminish the anchorage of collagen VI microfibrils to the extracellular matrix surrounding myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is the cause for sarcolemma-specific collagen VI deficiency </plain></SENT>
