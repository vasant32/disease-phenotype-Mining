<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe the early manifestation and sequential assessment of the central and peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system in a Japanese girl with merosin-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She showed severe <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> (''<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270971" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">floppy infant</z:e>") and suffered mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> postnatally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase was elevated to 11,487 IU/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The muscle biopsy showed dystrophic changes with negative expression of merosin (laminin Î±2), thereby confirming merosin-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Her motor milestones were severely delayed, but she could sit without support at the age of 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 3 years, her motor ability deteriorated and by the age of 5 years, she could not sit and control her neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 2 months of age revealed patterns that were appropriate for her age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 1 year of age, the T2 weighted images showed diffuse high signal intensities throughout the centrum semiovale, and periventricular and subcortical white matter of the frontal and occipital lobes, while the U fibers, the corpus callosum and the internal capsule were spared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the age of 7 years, these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter abnormalities</z:hpo> decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy (MRS) revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values of N-acetylaspartate (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>)/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> (Cr) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> (Cho)/Cr metabolite ratios as well as slightly increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17268">myoinositol</z:chebi> (mI)/Cr metabolite ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neurophysiological motor nerve conduction velocity (MCV) and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) of the median nerve were in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range at the age of 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After the child reached 1 year of age, the MCV and CMAP lagged behind those of healthy controlled children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The sensory nerve conduction velocity of the median nerve demonstrated a mild delay at the age of 15 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It improved to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range at the age of 6 years but decreased at 7 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These sequential findings suggest not only that muscular degeneration and dysmyelination had occurred but also that various other factors, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> and the vasogenic system, may influence the pathology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> </plain></SENT>
