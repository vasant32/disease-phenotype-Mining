<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The laminin variant of adult skeletal muscle fibres and Schwann cells is known as merosin, and is composed of M-B1-B2 chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood vessels and immature fibres express the A chain in association with B1 or S, and B2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The importance of merosin has recently been shown by its absence in one form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and in the mutant dy/dy mouse, and by its partial deficiency in Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have examined the immunocytochemical localization of the M, A, B1 and B2 laminin chains in human fetal muscle from 7 to 40 weeks' gestation to ascertain their developmental expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The B1 and B2 chains were detected on muscle fibres at 7 weeks, but only traces of the A or M chain were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By 21 weeks maximal levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four subunits were observed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the basement membrane is still being assembled until this stage of development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of the A chain on muscle fibres was not reduced until 34 weeks and low levels persisted at birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The concomitant expression of the M and A chains at early stages may indicate a laminin variant, in addition to merosin, that is highly expressed in fetal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Merosin was seen in intramuscular nerves at 11 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>B1 and B2 subunits were detected in blood vessels from 7 weeks' gestation and the A chain from 11 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The capillary network, however, is not fully established in fetal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Merosin is therefore detected early during human fetal muscle development, and this should be taken into account when assessing aborted fetuses at risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
