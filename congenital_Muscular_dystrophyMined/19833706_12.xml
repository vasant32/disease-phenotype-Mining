<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This article presents a comprehensive review of large and highly diverse superfamily of nucleotidyltransferase fold proteins by providing a global picture about their evolutionary history, sequence-structure diversity and fulfilled functional roles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using top-of-the-line homology detection method combined with transitive searches and fold recognition, we revised the realm of these superfamily in numerous databases of catalogued protein families and structures, and identified 10 new families of nucleotidyltransferase fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These families include hundreds of previously uncharacterized and various poorly annotated proteins such as Fukutin/LICD, NFAT, FAM46, Mab-21 and NRAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some of these proteins seem to play novel important roles, not observed before for this superfamily, such as regulation of gene expression or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> incorporation into cell membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Importantly, within newly detected families we identified 25 novel superfamily members in human genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among these newly assigned members are proteins known to be involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> pigmentosa what sheds some new light on the molecular background of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve of new human nucleotidyltransferase fold proteins belong to Mab-21 family known to be involved in organogenesis and development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The determination of specific biological functions of these newly detected proteins remains a challenging task </plain></SENT>
