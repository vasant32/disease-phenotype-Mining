<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The "pure" form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> is not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo> or structural changes in the brain, though white matter changes on brain imaging have been detected in a significant proportion of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we evaluated the incidence of sensory abnormalities (somatosensory and visual evoked responses) in a group of 17 patients with "pure" <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and correlated the results of the evoked responses with the presence or absence of white matter changes on brain magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results show close correlation between the presence of MRI white matter changes and abnormalities in the sensory evoked potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversely, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain MRI had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Visual evoked potentials were less sensitive than somatosensory evoked potentials in detecting abnormalities in children with white matter changes on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With the recent discovery of deficiency in merosin expression in the skeletal muscle of a subgroup of patients with CMD, we also correlated the presence or absence of white matter changes and the SEP responses with the merosin status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> merosin-negative patients had abnormal SEP as well as abnormal MRI, whilst no patient with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> merosin expression had an abnormal scan or abnormal SEP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
