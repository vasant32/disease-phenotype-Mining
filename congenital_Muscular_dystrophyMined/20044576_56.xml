<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Receptor binding is thought to be mediated by a posttranslational modification, and defective binding with laminin underlies a subclass of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using mass spectrometry- and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based structural analyses, we identified a phosphorylated O-mannosyl glycan on the mucin-like domain of recombinant alpha-DG, which was required for laminin binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that patients with muscle-eye-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> and Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, as well as mice with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026850" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">myodystrophy</z:e>, commonly have defects in a postphosphoryl modification of this phosphorylated O-linked <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi>, and that this modification is mediated by the like-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (LARGE) protein </plain></SENT>
