<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CMD1A form is caused by a deficiency of the alpha2 chain of laminin 2 (LAMA2 gene at 6q2), a protein present in the basal lamina of muscle fibers, in Schwann cells, epidermis, and in fetal trophoblastic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This allows its study for prenatal diagnosis in the chorionic villous (CV), which was performed in a family with one deceased affected CMD1A child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of the CV using antibodies against the C- and N-terminal domains of the alpha2-laminin protein showed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> positive labeling for both antibodies in the "at-risk" CV, which did not differ from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control CV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The integrity of the CV membrane was confirmed through the analysis with antibodies against alpha1, beta1, and gamma1 laminins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA study using markers flanking the 6q2 region showed that the affected patient and the "at-risk" fetus did not share the same haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the fetus was considered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> through both methodologies, which was confirmed after the birth of a clinically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> male baby </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As the LAMA2 gene is very large and the spectrum of mutations causing disease is wide, the analysis of the protein in muscle biopsy has been largely used for the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Besides, the possibility to detect it in the chorionic villous, mainly using positive markers, also offers a powerful tool for prenatal diagnosis </plain></SENT>
