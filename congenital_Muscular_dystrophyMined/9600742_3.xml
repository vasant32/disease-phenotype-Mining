<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to six new families, two previously reported families were reexamined by haplotype analysis including detection of an ancestral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> haplotype (138-183-301) for 3 microsatellite markers closest to the FCMD gene, designated D9S2105-D9S2107-D9S172, the distances of which from the FCMD gene are presumed to be approximately 140, approximately 20, and approximately 280 kb, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five fetuses from five families were diagnosed as nonaffected, and were subsequently confirmed to be healthy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three fetuses of the other three families were diagnosed as having a high probability of being affected by FCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the prenatal diagnosis conducted for these eight families, the ancestral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> allele was observed in 13 of 16 (81%) FCMD-bearing chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Detection of the ancestral haplotype facilitated achieving accurate prenatal diagnosis of FCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The brains of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three fetuses prenatally diagnosed as FCMD-affected showed the initial stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo>, strong evidence of FCMD </plain></SENT>
