<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent identification of the FCMD gene locus at 9q31-q33 provided the basis for prenatal diagnosis and carrier detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recently developed new microsatellite markers which are closer to the FCMD gene and improved the phenotype probability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine fetuses in eight unrelated FCMD families, including a twin pregnancy, were analysed using the newly developed markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four fetuses showed over 99% probability of being healthy either as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> homozygote (n = 1) or heterozygote carrier (n = 3) and were born without signs of FCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other five fetuses were diagnosed with a probability of FCMD of 99% or greater; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the latter parents decided to terminate the pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain malformations characteristic of FCMD in one of the aborted fetuses confirmed the diagnosis of FCMD at 19 weeks of gestation </plain></SENT>
