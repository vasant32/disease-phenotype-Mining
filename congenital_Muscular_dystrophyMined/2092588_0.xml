<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The diaphragm muscle pathology in four patients with Fukuyama type congenital progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD) was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the diaphragm muscle fibers of three patients aged more than 14 years exhibiting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo>, a lot of electron dense lesions, which varied in size but did not extend over the whole length of the muscle fibers, and a marked increase in mitochondria were observed as well as the dystrophic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dense lesions, consisting of electron dense fibrillary material comparable to Z-band materials in electron density, seemed to be due to Z-band disruption leading to streaming and/or large aggregations of Z-band materials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No mitochondria or other microorganelles were found in these dense lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings are thought not to be specific to FCMD, but seem to reflect diaphragm <z:mp ids='MP_0003646'>muscle fatigue</z:mp>, because, there were no such lesions in the diaphragm muscle of a 2-year-old infant not exhibiting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> or in muscle at other sites in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
