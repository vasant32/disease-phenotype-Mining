<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the short- and long-term efficacy of this methodology in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> animals and in mouse models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (dy/dy, dy(2J)/dy(2J)), or Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (mdx/mdx) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a reporter construct, the short-term efficacy of fiber transduction reached 40% and was similar in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>, dy/dy and dy(2J)/dy(2J) animals, indicating that ongoing muscle <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> was not a major obstacle to the electrotransfer-mediated gene transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the complete rejection of transduced fibers was observed within 3 weeks in the absence of immunosuppression, the persistency was prolonged over 10 weeks when transient or continuous immunosuppressive regimens were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using therapeutic plasmids, we demonstrated that electrotransfer also allowed the transduction of large constructs encoding the laminin alpha2 chain in dy/dy mouse, or a chimeric dystrophin-EGFP protein in mdx/mdx mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The correct sarcolemmal localization of these structural proteins demonstrated the functional relevance of their expression in vivo, with a diffusion domain estimated to be 300 to 500 microm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, degeneration-regeneration events hampered the long-term stability of transduced fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Given its efficacy for naked DNA transfer in these models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo>, and despite some limitations, gene electrotransfer methodology should be further explored as a potential avenue for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
