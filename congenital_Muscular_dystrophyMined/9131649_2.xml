<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The methods used were immuno-gold cytochemistry on cryo-ultramicrotomy sections and thin-section-fracture-label, together with electron microscopy observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results were compared with light microscopy peroxidase immuno-staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skin samples and skin biopsies from laminin alpha 2 chain deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> affected patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results show that, in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skin, the laminin alpha 2 chain is spread throughout the cytoplasm of basal keratinocytes, while it appears associated with desmosomal tonofilaments in the spinous and granular epidermal layers; in skin samples from dystrophic patients the laminin alpha 2 chain was not detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the function of the laminin alpha 2 chain is different in the epidermis as compared to that in muscle and peripheral nerve, where it is localized in the basement membrane </plain></SENT>
