<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Alpha-dystroglycanopathies are a group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> (CMDs) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive inheritance</z:hpo> characterized by abnormal glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although six genetic causes have been identified (FKTN, POMGNT1, POMT1, POMT2, FKRP, and LARGE) many alpha-dystroglycanopathy patients remain without a genetic diagnosis after standard exon sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date POMT2 mutations have been identified in CMD cases with a wide range of clinical severities from Walker-Warburg syndrome to <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> without structural brain or ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed POMT2 in six CMD patients, who had severe diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0003324'>muscle weakness, generalized</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>joint contractures</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo> and elevated CK levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eye involvement was absent or limited to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000486'>strabismus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We sequenced the coding regions of POMT2 using genomic DNA and cDNA generated from blood lymphocytes or B lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantitative PCR analysis of genomic DNA was used to identify and determine the breakpoints of large deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We report five novel mutations in POMT2, four of which were outside of coding exons, two large genomic deletions and two intronic single base substitutions that induced aberrant <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Large scale DNA rearrangements (such as large deletions) and cryptic splice mutations, that can be missed on standard sequencing of genomic DNA, may be relatively common in POMT2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional techniques, such as sequencing of cDNA are needed to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results also confirm that POMT2 mutations are an important cause of the less severe alpha-dystroglycanopathy phenotypes </plain></SENT>
