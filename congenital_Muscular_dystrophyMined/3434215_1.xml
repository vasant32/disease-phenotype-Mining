<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A significantly greater proportion of surface area was taken up by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27729">digitonin</z:chebi>-cholesterol complexes in the patients (51.2% +/- 4.7%) than in controls (31.9% +/- 2.9%) (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since membrane cholesterol has a dynamic regulatory function in affecting the activity of membrane-bound proteins, the increased cholesterol content in the patients suggests a functional abnormality of the muscle plasma membrane in this disease </plain></SENT>
