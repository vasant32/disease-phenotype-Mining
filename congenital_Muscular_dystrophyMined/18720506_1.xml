<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the early pathogenesis of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate early histological changes in muscle of patients with molecularly confirmed UCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsies were analyzed from 8 UCMD patients ranging in age from 6 to 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type I fiber <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and predominance were seen early, together with a widening of the fiber diameter spectrum, whereas no dystrophic features were apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A subpopulation of more severely atrophic type I fibers was apparent subsequently, including one biopsy that fulfilled the formal diagnostic criteria of histopathological fiber type disproportion (FTD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, early in the disease, UCMD presents as a non-dystrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with predominant fiber <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collagen VI mutations also qualify as a cause of fiber type disproportion </plain></SENT>
