<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in COL6A1, COL6A2 and COL6A3, the genes which encode the extra-cellular matrix component collagen VI, lead to Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> and Ullrich <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (UCMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the Col6a1(-/-) null mouse has an extremely mild neuromuscular phenotype, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> defect has been demonstrated, linked to dysregulation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> permeability transition pore (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi>) opening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This finding has been replicated in UCMD muscle cells in culture, providing justification for a clinical trial using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A, an inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi> opening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi> dysregulation could be detected in UCMD fibroblasts (the predominant source of muscle collagen VI), in myoblast cells from patients with other diseases and its response to rescue agents other than collagen VI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although we confirm the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi> dysregulation in muscle-derived cultures from two UCMD patients, fibroblasts from the same patients and the majority of fibroblasts from other well-characterized UCMD patients behave normally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi> dysregulation is found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (LGMD) type 2B myoblasts but not in myoblasts from patients with Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, merosin-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, LGMD2A, Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023264" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SNE">Leigh syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to rescue by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A and collagen VI, this <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cellular phenotype</z:mp> was also rescued by other extra-cellular matrix constituents (laminin and collagen I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As the muscle derived cultures demonstrating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi> dysregulation shared <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>poor growth</z:hpo> in culture and lack of desmin labelling, we believe that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi> dysregulation may be a particular characteristic of the state of these cells in culture and is not specific to the collagen VI defect, and can in any case be rescued by a range of extra-cellular matrix components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further work is needed on the relationship of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi> dysregulation with UCMD pathology </plain></SENT>
