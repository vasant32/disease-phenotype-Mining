<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In addition to skeletal muscle and the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, α-dystroglycan is found in the podocyte basal membrane, stabilizing these cells on the glomerular basement membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fukutin, named after the gene responsible for Fukuyama-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, is a putative glycosyltransferase required for the post-translational modification of α-dystroglycan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chimeric mice targeted for both alleles of fukutin develop severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>; however, these mice do not have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite the lack of a functional renal defect, we evaluated glomerular structure and found minor abnormalities in the chimeric mice by light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy revealed flattening of podocyte foot processes, the number of which was significantly lower in the chimeric compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A monoclonal antibody against the laminin-binding carbohydrate residues of α-dystroglycan did not detect α-dystroglycan glycosylation in the glomeruli by immunoblotting or immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, expression of the core α-dystroglycan protein was preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference in dystroglycan <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression or in the amount of nephrin and α3-integrin protein in the chimeric compared to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice as judged by immunohistochemistry and real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, our results indicate that appropriate glycosylation of α-dystroglycan has an important role in the maintenance of podocyte architecture </plain></SENT>
