<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> has been reported in some clinical cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, we have begun to examine whether these glycosyltransferases are required for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development of the basilar pons, one of several precerebellar nuclei of the hindbrain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In veils (Large(vls)) mice, which carry a loss-of-function mutation in the Large glycosyltransferase gene, the basilar pons is absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Instead, ectopic clusters of pontine neurons are found lateral to their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> site, suggesting that these neurons are unable to migrate to their appropriate site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two other precerebellar nuclei, the lateral reticular nucleus and the inferior olive, are present in Large(vls) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the basilar pons forms normally in dystrophin-deficient mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that the Large glycosyltransferase but not dystrophin is required for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> basilar pontine development </plain></SENT>
