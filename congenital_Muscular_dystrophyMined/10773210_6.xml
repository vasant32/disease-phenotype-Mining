<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DCX immunoreactivity was detected predominantly in the fetal cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The neurons in the cortical plate (CP) exhibited positive labeling at 9 GW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Staining was the most marked intense at 12-20 GW, and gradually decreased thereafter, only relatively weak immunoreactivity remaining in pyramidal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the immunohistochemical characteristics of DCX and those of nestin and vimentin indicated the early expression of DCX in neuroepithelial stem cells of the subventricular germinal layer, as well as in neurons of the CP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most marked intense expression in the period of neuronal migration strongly indicated its role in neuronal migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The abnormal distribution of DCX immunolabeling in the cerebral cortex was associated with a neuronal disarrangement in some migration disorders, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265219" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MDLS">Miller-Dieker syndrome</z:e> and Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Decreased DCX immunolabeling was demonstrated in fetuses and infants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="ZS|ZWS">Zellweger syndrome</z:e>, implicating DCX in the neuronal migration abnormality in this syndrome </plain></SENT>
