<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has recently been shown that merosin, an extracellular matrix protein linked to the dystrophin-associated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi>, is deficient in a proportion of patients with classical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have undertaken a detailed study of the clinical features and brain imaging in 24 cases of CMD in relation to the merosin status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemistry showed that merosin was present in 13 cases and markedly deficient in 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the merosin-positive cases, the maximum motor achievement was independent walking in 11, walking with support in one and sitting unsupported in one (currently 18 months old) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, none of the merosin-deficient cases achieved independent ambulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two achieved walking with support, nine standing with support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, nine of the 11 merosin-deficient cases had a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase level greater than 2000 whereas only one merosin-positive case had this degree of elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was carried out on 15 of the children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eight merosin-positive cases had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> scans whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven of the merosin-deficient cases had significant changes in the white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study has demonstrated that children with merosin-deficient CMD have a more severe clinical phenotype and associated white matter changes on brain imaging </plain></SENT>
