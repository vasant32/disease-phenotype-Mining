<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the human Laminin-alpha2 (LAMA2) gene result in the most common form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously identified a zebrafish model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> called candyfloss (caf), carrying a loss-of-function mutation in the zebrafish lama2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the skeletal muscle, laminins connect the muscle cell to the extracellular matrix (ECM) by binding either dystroglycan or integrins at the cell membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Through epistasis experiments, we have established that both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> systems individually contribute to the maintenance of fibre <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> and exhibit muscle detachment phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, larval zebrafish in which both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> systems are simultaneously genetically inactivated possess a catastrophic failure of muscle attachment that is far greater than a simple addition of individual phenotypes would predict </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We provide evidence that this is due to other crucial laminins present in addition to Lama2, which aid muscle cell attachments and integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have found that lama1 is important for maintaining attachments, whereas lama4 is localized and up-regulated in damaged fibres, which appears to contribute to fibre survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, our results show that endogenous secretion of laminins from the surrounding tissues has the potential to reinforce fibre attachments and strengthen laminin-ECM attachments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Collectively these findings provide a better understanding of the cellular pathology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> and help in designing effective therapies </plain></SENT>
