<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This shortage may be further compounded by concerns about organ quality, leading to refusal of potential donor organ offers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report on the successful transplantation and 5-year follow-up of a heart from a donor with Ullrich <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (UCMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The candidate was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> at the time of the transplant and the donor organ was declined repeatedly on the match run list due to concerns about organ quality, despite having <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardiac function by echocardiography on minimal inotropic support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We believe the diagnosis of "<z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>" in the donor combined with a lack of understanding about the specifics of the diagnosis of UCMD enabled our candidate to receive a primary offer for this organ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We are unaware of any previous reports of the use of a heart from a donor with UCMD for orthotopic heart transplantation in adults or children </plain></SENT>
