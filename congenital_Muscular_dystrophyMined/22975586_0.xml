<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by loss of individual muscle fibers and muscle mass and proliferation of connective and adipose tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to investigate the mechanisms by which collagen VI regulates muscle cell survival, size, and regeneration and, in particular, the potential role of the ubiquitin-proteasome and calpain-proteolytic systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied muscle biopsies of UCMD (n = 6), other <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (n = 12), and control patients (n = 10) and found reduced expression of atrogin-1, MURF1, and calpain-3 mRNAs in UCMD cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Downregulation of calpain-3 was associated with changes in the nuclear immunolocalization of nuclear factor-κB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also observed increased expression versus controls of regeneration markers at the protein and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Satellite cell numbers did not differ in collagen VI-deficient muscle versus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> nonregenerating muscle, indicating that collagen VI does not play a key role in the maintenance of the satellite cell pool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that alterations in calpain-3 and nuclear factor-κB signaling pathways may contribute to muscle mass loss in UCMD muscle, whereas atrogin-1 and MURF1 are not likely to play a major role </plain></SENT>
