<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients (age range: 5.8-15.3 years) were assessed by the Wechsler Intelligence Scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve were merosin-positive and ten merosin-deficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One child had <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo> and could not be tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The full scale IQ in the remaining 21 ranged from 51 to 134, the verbal IQ ranged from 78 to 136 and the performance from 51 to 136 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the twelve children with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> merosin one had a mild delay (IQ &lt; 75) and two were borderline (IQ 75-95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the ten children with merosin-deficiency, one showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo> and could not be tested, one showed a mild delay and two had borderline results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While the children with merosin deficiency with the typical diffuse white matter changes on MRI had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> scores, the children who in addition had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001321'>cerebellar hypoplasia</z:hpo> had lower performance IQ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The child with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo> had <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the spectrum of cognitive abilities in CMD is very wide even within genetically homogeneous conditions </plain></SENT>
