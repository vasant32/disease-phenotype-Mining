<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) findings were typical of those previously described in this disorder, and were characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001339'>lissencephaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, and cerebral and cerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo> with glial and neuronal displacement into the leptomeninges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> of pyramidal tracts were noted in the brain stem and spinal cord, as well as malformation of the inferior olivary and dentate nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Skeletal muscle and eyes appeared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The genetic defect in this disorder is expressed in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> early during the first trimester and causes a marked disorder of cellular migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overt changes in muscle occur during a later period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The changes in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> are similar to, but more severe than, those found in Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, and both may represent a failure of constraint of neuronal migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whether the syndromes characterized by cerebro-<z:mp ids='MP_0002092'>ocular dysplasia</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> are genetically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> or allelic variations is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Molecular genetic analysis should elucidate this question </plain></SENT>
