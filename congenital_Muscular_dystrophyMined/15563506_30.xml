<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>UCMD, a severe disorder characterized by congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0003701'>muscle weakness, proximal</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>joint contractures</z:hpo> and marked distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001382'>joint hyperextensibility</z:hpo>, has been considered a recessive condition, and homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations have been defined in COL6A2 and COL6A3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the milder disorder Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> shows clear dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> and is caused by heterozygous mutations in COL6A1, COL6A2 and COL6A3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This model, where dominant mutations cause mild Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> and recessive mutations cause severe UCMD was recently challenged when a patient with UCMD was shown to have a heterozygous in-frame deletion in COL6A1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have studied five patients with a clinical diagnosis of UCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients had heterozygous in-frame deletions in the N-terminal region of the triple helical domain, one in the alpha1(VI) chain, one in alpha2(VI) and one in alpha3(VI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collagen VI protein biosynthesis and assembly studies showed that these mutations act in a dominant negative fashion and result in severe collagen VI matrix deficiencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient had recessive amino acid changes in the C2 subdomain of alpha2(VI), which prevented collagen VI assembly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No collagen VI mutations were found in the fifth patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that rather than being a rare cause of UCMD, dominant mutations are common in UCMD, now accounting for four of the 14 published cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mutation detection in this disorder remains critical for accurate genetic counseling of patients and their families </plain></SENT>
