<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the developing <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> alpha- and beta-dystroglycan are highly concentrated in the endfeet of radial neuroepithelial cells at the contact site to the basal lamina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We show that injection of anti-dystroglycan Fab fragments, knockdown of dystroglycan using RNAi, and overexpression of a dominant-negative dystroglycan protein by microelectroporation in neuroepithelial cells of the chick retina and optic tectum in vivo leads to the loss of their radial <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, to hyperproliferation, to an increased number of postmitotic neurons, and to an altered distribution of several basally concentrated proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these treatments also altered the oriented growth of axons from <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> ganglion cells and from tectal projection neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, expression of non-cleavable dystroglycan protein in neuroepithelial cells reduced their proliferation and their differentiation to postmitotic neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that dystroglycan plays a key role in maintaining neuroepithelial cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, and that interfering with dystroglycan function influences proliferation and differentiation of neuroepithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data also suggest that an impaired dystroglycan function in neuroepithelial cells might be responsible for some of the severe brain abnormalities observed in certain forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
