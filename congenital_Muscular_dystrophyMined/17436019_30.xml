<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These mutations result in a virtual lack of glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compound heterozygous LARGE mutations have been reported in a single human patient, manifesting with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These mutations are likely to retain some residual LARGE glycosyltransferase activity as indicated by residual alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation in patient cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that more severe LARGE mutations are associated with a more severe CMD phenotype in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we report a 63-kb intragenic LARGE deletion in a family with Walker-Warburg syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e>), which is characterized by CMD, and severe structural brain and <z:mp ids='MP_0002092'>eye malformations</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding demonstrates that LARGE gene mutations can give rise to a wide clinical spectrum, similar as for other genes that have a role in the post-translational modification of the alpha-dystroglycan protein </plain></SENT>
