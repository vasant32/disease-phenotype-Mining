<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Laminin alpha 2, a sub-unit of the basement membrane component laminin-2, is deficient in the dy/dy and allelic dy2 J/dy2 J mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is also the defective protein in a proportion of children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Linkage and mutational analysis have established that this is a primary effect caused by defects in the LAMA2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Laminin alpha 2 has previously been shown to be deficient in dy/dy skeletal muscle, peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report here preliminary observations on differences in detection of laminin alpha 2 in muscle, peripheral nerves and brain of dy/dy mice using three, well characterized antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> muscle laminin alpha 2 is localized to the basement membrane of the myofibres and the Schwann cells of peripheral nerves, whilst in adult brain it is only detected on blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results show that there is appreciable, but slightly reduced, expression of laminin alpha 2 in skeletal muscle of dy/dy mice but almost no detectable protein in the brain, peripheral nerve and spinal nerve roots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our observations are at present unexplained but they raise the possibility for the first time that there may be different tissue specific isoforms of laminin alpha 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Molecular characterization of possible differences responsible for our observations may aid the identification of the mutation in the dy/dy mouse and lead to a better understanding of the role and expression of laminin alpha 2 in pathological conditions </plain></SENT>
