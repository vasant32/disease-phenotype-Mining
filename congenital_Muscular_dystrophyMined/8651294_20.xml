<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately half of CMD patients present laminin alpha2-chain (merosin) deficiency in muscle biopsies, and the disease locus has been mapped to the region of the LAMA2 gene (6q22-23) in several families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, two nonsense mutations in the laminin alpha2-chain gene were identified in CMD patients exhibiting complete deficiency of the laminin alpha2-chain in muscle biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, a subset of CMD patients with linkage to LAMA2 show only partial absence of the laminin alpha2-chain around muscle fibers, by immunocytochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study we have identified a homozygous missense mutation in the alpha2-chain gene of a consanguineous Turkish family with partial laminin alpha2-chain deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The T--&gt;C transition at position 3035 in the cDNA sequence results in a Cys996--&gt;Arg substitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mutation that affects one of the conserved cysteine-rich repeats in the short arm of the laminin alpha2-chain should result in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> synthesis of the chain and in formation and secretion of a heterotrimeric laminin molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Muscular dysfunction is possibly caused either by abnormal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> cross-links and folding of the laminin repeat, leading to the disturbance of an as yet unknown binding function of the laminin alpha2-chain and to shorter half-life of the muscle-specific laminin-2 and laminin-4 isoforms, or by increased proteolytic sensitivity, leading to truncation of the short arm </plain></SENT>
