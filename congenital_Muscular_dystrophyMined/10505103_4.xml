<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The laminin alpha 2 chain is absent or drastically reduced in a subgroup of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> patients, and in the severely affected dystrophic dy/dy mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> primary mouse muscle cell cultures conferred laminin alpha 2 chain expression in dy/dy mice muscles upon cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study we investigated whether pure myoblast cell lines were able to confer laminin alpha 2 chain expression in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed that: (1) xeno-transplantation of non-immortalized human myoblast in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mouse muscles allows human laminin alpha 2 chain expression; (2) allotransplantation of the permanent G8 mouse myoblast cell line in dy/dy muscles allows the expression of the murine laminin alpha 2 chain; and (3) allo-transplantation of the D7 dystrophic dy/dy cell line allows the formation of new and hybrid muscle fibers in dy/dy muscle in the absence of laminin alpha 2 chain expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> myoblasts are able to restore the expression of an extracellular skeletal muscle protein and that the absence of laminin-2 does not prevent transplanted muscle cells from participating in the formation of myofibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Myoblasts are, therefore, attractive tools for further exploration of gene complementation strategies in the animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
