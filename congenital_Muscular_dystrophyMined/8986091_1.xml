<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that serum levels of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">ketone</z:chebi> bodies often elevate in patients with Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cause of this <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>abnormal metabolism</z:mp>, however, has not been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, serum levels of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">ketone</z:chebi> bodies were measured in the early morning in patients with DMD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum free fatty acids (FFA), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and thickness of subcutaneous fat were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">Ketone</z:chebi> bodies elevated in most DMD patients, but not elevated in patients with the other disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002575'>Hyperketonemia</z:mp> in the DMD patients was accompanied by elevation of the FFA level, but no correlation was seen between <z:mp ids='MP_0002575'>hyperketonemia</z:mp> and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase level or the severity of muscle involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences were found between DMD patients and others in the levels of FFA, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and thickness of subcutaneous fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that DMD patients are more prone to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001946'>ketosis</z:hpo> than the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> administration (2 mg/day) on <z:mp ids='MP_0002575'>hyperketonemia</z:mp> also was investigated in 11 patients with DMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The levels of total <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">ketone</z:chebi> bodies decreased by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> administration for 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the utilization of FFA and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">ketone</z:chebi> bodies may be impaired in DMD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">Biotin</z:chebi> treatment will be useful for improving the <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>abnormal metabolism</z:mp> of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">ketone</z:chebi> bodies in DMD patients </plain></SENT>
