<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Swollen fetuses, mummified fetuses, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002804'>arthrogryposis</z:hpo> and cranial deformities were produced in 13 of 415 newborn hamsters inoculated transplacentally (3.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence was significantly higher than that in the control group (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight cases presenting apparent abnormalities were examined histologically and virologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pictures of skeletal muscles showing such immature features as chains of internal nuclei and myotubular muscle fibers were demonstrated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, perivascular infiltration of small round cells and thickening of vascular walls were seen in 5 cases, while myogenic changes such as broken myofibrils, small muscle fibers and changes in fiber size were observed in 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the anterior horn of the spinal cord, swelling and loss of nuclei and cell matrices were noticed in 4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the cerebral cortex, disarrangement of cell layers, edematous changes and loss of nerve cells were revealed in 5 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 4 cases virus particles were found on electron microscopy in the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The authors considered that this experimental system of intrauterine <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> would be useful for the etiological study of FCMD and AMC in humans in which not only skeletal muscles but also the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system is affected congenitally </plain></SENT>
