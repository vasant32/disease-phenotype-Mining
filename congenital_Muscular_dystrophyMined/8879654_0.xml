<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several variants of CMD have been described and the disease has recently been classified into five clinically distinct forms: the two classical CMDs with and without deficit of the laminin M chain (merosin), the Fukuyama CMD described in Japanese patients and recently linked to the chromosome 9q31-33, the clinically more severe Walker-Warburg syndrome and the rare muscle-eye-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> described in Finnish patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most of these forms have central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is usually not seen in the classical merosin positive CMD, but can be very severe in the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a 3-year-old Mediterranean child with clinical and histopathological signs of CMD, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> expression of merosin, severe clinical and radiological evidence of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement without defects of neuronal migration or brain malformations and without ocular anomalies </plain></SENT>
