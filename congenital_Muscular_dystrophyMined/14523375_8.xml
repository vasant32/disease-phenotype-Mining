<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> is paralleled by molecular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>; each of the 10 forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal-recessive</z:hpo> LGMD recognized to date is caused by mutations in a distinct gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a large consanguineous Bedouin tribe living in northern Israel, 15 individuals affected by LGMD demonstrate an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A genome-wide screen followed by fine mapping in this family revealed linkage to a region on chromosome 19 harboring the fukutin-related protein gene (FKRP), with a maximal LOD score of 4.8 for D19S902 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FKRP, encoding a putative glycosyltransferase, has been implicated in causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> 1C (MDC1C), and has recently been shown to be mutated in LGMD2I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified a novel missense mutation in exon 4 of the FKRP gene in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected individuals were homozygous for the same mutation, a marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>phenotypic variability</z:hpo> was apparent within the family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This finding may suggest a role of modifier genes and environmental factors in LGMD2I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the demonstration that an identical, novel mutation in the FKRP gene can cause a muscle disease of either a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003577'>congenital onset</z:hpo> or of a later <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> within a single family provides clinical support to the molecular evidence, suggesting that MDC1C and LGMD2I are overlapping ends of one and the same entity </plain></SENT>
