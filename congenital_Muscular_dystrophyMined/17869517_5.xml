<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six genes are responsible for these diseases with overlapping phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the usefulness of a biochemical approach for the diagnosis and investigation of the alpha-dystroglycanopathies using immortalized lymphoblasts prepared from genetically diagnosed and undiagnosed CMD patients and from control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured the activities of protein O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> beta1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (POMGnT1) and protein O-mannosyltransferase (POMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lymphoblasts from patients harbouring known mutations in either POMGNT1 or POMT1 showed a marked decrease in POMGnT1 or POMT activity, respectively, compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we identified pathogenic mutations in POMGNT1, POMT1 or POMT2 in six previously genetically uncharacterised patients who had very low enzyme activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the lymphoblast-based enzymatic assay is a sensitive and useful method (i) to select patients harbouring POMGNT1, POMT1 or POMT2 mutations; (ii) to assess the pathogenicity of new or already described mutations </plain></SENT>
