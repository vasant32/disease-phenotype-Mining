<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Numerous transgenic and knockout mouse models of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598589" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hereditary neuropathies</z:e> have become available over the past decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a simple, reproducible, and safe biopsy of mouse skin for histopathological evaluation of the peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (PNS) in models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598589" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hereditary neuropathies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the diagnostic outcome between sciatic nerve and dermal nerves found in skin biopsy (SB) from the hind foot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of five animal models of different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007959" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Charcot-Marie-Tooth</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathies</z:e>, and one model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> mice, dermal nerve fibers were readily identified by immunohistochemistry, light, and electron microscopy and they appeared similar to myelinated fibers in sciatic nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In mutant mice, SB manifested myelin abnormalities similar to those observed in sciatic nerves, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0003429'>hypomyelination</z:hpo>, onion bulbs, myelin outfolding, redundant loops, and tomacula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In many strains, however, SB showed additional abnormalities--fiber loss, dense neurofilament packing with lower phosphorylation status, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005405'>axonal degeneration</z:mp>-undetected in sciatic nerve, possibly because SB samples distal nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SB, a reliable technique to investigate <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathies</z:hpo> in human beings, is also useful to investigate animal models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598589" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hereditary neuropathies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that SB may reveal distal axonal pathology in mouse models and permits sequential follow-up of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> in an individual mouse, thereby reducing the number of mice necessary to document pathology of the PNS </plain></SENT>
