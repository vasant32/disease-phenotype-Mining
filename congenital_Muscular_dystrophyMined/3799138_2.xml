<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was extensive brain malformation, but the most severe pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo> was absent in one case and in the other two localized bilaterally to small areas near the occipital poles </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>paired helical filaments</z:hpo>, with a maximal width of about 25 nm and regular constrictions at approximately 80 nm intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo>, which is unknown in younger patients, suggests the presence of degenerative processes in the brains of the older patients with FCMD </plain></SENT>
