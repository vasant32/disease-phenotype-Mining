<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After our initial mapping of the FCMD locus to chromosome 9q31-33, we further defined the locus within a region of approximately 5 cM between loci D9S127 and CA246, by homozygosity mapping in patients born to consanguineous marriages and by recombination analyses in other families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also found evidence for strong linkage disequilibrium between FCMD and a polymorphic microsatellite marker, mfd220, which showed no recombination and a lod score of (Z) 17.49 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A "111-bp" allele for the mfd220 locus was observed in 22 (34%) of 64 FCMD chromosomes, but it was present in only 1 of 120 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This allelic association with FCMD was highly significant (chi 2 = 50.7; P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hence, we suspect that the FCMD gene could lie within a few hundred kilobases of the mfd220 locus </plain></SENT>
