<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fukuyama-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD), one of the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> disorders in Japan, is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> associated with brain malformation due to a defect in neuronal migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, we identified the gene responsible for FCMD, which encodes the fukutin protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most FCMD-bearing chromosomes (87%) are derived from a single ancestral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e>, who lived 2,000-2,500 years ago and whose mutation consisted of a 3-kb retrotransposal insertion in the 3' non-coding region of the fukutin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we show, through detailed sequence analysis, that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> insertion is derived from the SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) retroposon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To enable rapid detection of this insertion, we have developed a PCR-based diagnostic method that uses three primers simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used this method to investigate the distribution and origin of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> insertion, screening a total of 4,718 control DNA samples from Japanese and other Northeast Asian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifteen <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> chromosomes were detected among 2,814 Japanese individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Heterozygous carriers were found in various regions throughout Japan, with an averaged ratio of 1 in 188 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In Korean populations, we detected one carrier in 935 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, we were unable to detect any heterozygous alleles in 203 Mongolians and 766 Mainland Chinese populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data largely rule out the possibility that a single ancestor bearing an insertion-chromosome immigrated to Japan from Korea or Mainland China and appear to confirm that FCMD carriers are rare outside of Japan </plain></SENT>
