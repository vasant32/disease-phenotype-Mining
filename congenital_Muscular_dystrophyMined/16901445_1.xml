<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our findings in 21 Arab children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 21 cases were of the pure type, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mental status, except 1 case with perinatal hypoxic-ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen were laminin alpha2 (merosin) deficient, and six were laminin alpha2 positive; laminin alpha2 status was not determined in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the laminin alpha2-deficient patients achieved independent ambulation, whereas three of the laminin alpha2-positive patients were able to walk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The elevated levels of serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase did not differentiate the two groups and tended to decrease after the age of 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Radiologic evaluation demonstrated an abnormal central white-matter signal in 11 of 13 laminin alpha2-deficient and in 1 of 5 laminin alpha2-positive patients; none had evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002152'>brain dysplasia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nerve conduction velocities were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 5 of 5 laminin alpha2-positive patients, whereas in the laminin alpha2-deficient patients, it was slow in 9 of 11 for the motor nerves and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 8 of 9 for the sensory nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two of the laminin alpha2-positive patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003707'>pseudohypertrophy of the calves</z:hpo>, and two of the laminin alpha2-deficient ones had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patient in whom the laminin alpha2 status was not determined had a severe course, an abnormal central white-matter signal, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and resembled more the laminin alpha2-deficient group </plain></SENT>
