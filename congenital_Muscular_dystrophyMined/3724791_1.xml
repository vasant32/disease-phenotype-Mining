<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the regenerative capability of muscle fibers in Fukuyama type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD), muscle biopsies from nine patients were subjected to morphological examination by histochemical and electron microscopic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These results were compared with those from six patients with Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD) and nine controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Degenerating and regenerating fibers were not as frequent in FCMD as in DMD, whereas the number of type 2C fibers in the former was about twice that in the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On electron microscopy, numerous immature small fibers with disorganized myofibrils, an increased amount of intermediate filaments, large vesicular nuclei, and prominent nucleoli were observed in FCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Satellite cells (SCs), which are known to proliferate and contribute to <z:mp ids='MP_0000750'>muscle regeneration</z:mp> after myonecrosis, were not increased in number in FCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their incidence, 7.7% +/- 1.8%, was significantly lower than the 16.2% +/- 4.0% in DMD (P less than 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the ratio of area of SC nucleus to the overall area of the SC in FCMD, 64.1% +/- 9.7%, was larger than that in DMD, 58.9% +/- 9.3% (P less than 0.005), suggesting that SCs of FCMD were not in an active state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings lead to the conclusion that in FCMD the regenerative process is delayed due to either intrinsic or extrinsic factors, such as dense interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
