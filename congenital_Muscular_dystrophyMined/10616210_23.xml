<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in laminin alpha2, a subunit of the basement membrane protein laminin-2/merosin, cause merosin-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To gain insight into the molecular mechanism of disease, we generated and used a mutant mouse, dyW, in which the lacZ gene was inserted into the lama2 gene so that beta-galactosidase would be expressed in place of laminin alpha2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Heterozygous and homozygous mutant mice are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at birth, but homozygous mice develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> at 2 to 3 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lama2/lacZ gene was highly expressed in muscle in the early stages of embryonic myogenesis, but was down-regulated at later stages in both heterozygous and homozygous mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No beta-galactosidase activity was detected in skeletal muscle after birth in adult heterozygous mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, high beta-galactosidase activity was detected in postnatal homozygous mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Induction of injury in heterozygous mice resulted in intense reexpression of beta-galactosidase in the injured muscle early in regeneration, with a decline in enzyme activity as repair of the tissue progressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the initial response to injury was similar in heterozygous and homozygous mice with abundant beta-galactosidase-positive, mononucleated cells in the injured area, repair was rarely completed in the homozygous mice, evidently caused by excessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of cells associated with immature myofibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The defect in muscle repair was very efficiently corrected in homozygous dyW mice expressing a human LAMA2 transgene in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data show the importance of laminin alpha2 in <z:mp ids='MP_0000750'>muscle regeneration</z:mp> and suggest that a major contributor to disease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> is abortive regeneration </plain></SENT>
