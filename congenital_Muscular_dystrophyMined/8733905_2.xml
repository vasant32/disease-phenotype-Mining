<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She manifested marked <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> from the neonatal period, with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0003236'>elevated creatine kinase</z:hpo> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Her motor developmental milestones were markedly delayed; however, her intellectual development was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although cranial computed tomography (CT) at 3 months of age was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, subsequent CT at 16 months of age demonstrated diffuse, abnormal white matter lucencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsy findings at 16 months of age were compatible with those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, no muscle fibers were immunostained by the merosin antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> at 23 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These clinical symptoms and CT findings are similar to those described in patients with merosin-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> in European countries </plain></SENT>
