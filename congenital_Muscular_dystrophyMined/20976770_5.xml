<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Mutations in the genes encoding the extracellular matrix protein collagen VI (ColVI) cause a spectrum of disorders with variable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> including Ullrich <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, and intermediate phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We extensively characterized, at the clinical, cellular, and molecular levels, 49 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in the first 2 years of life to investigate genotype-phenotype correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were classified into 3 groups: early-severe (18%), moderate-progressive (53%), and mild (29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ColVI secretion was analyzed in patient-derived skin fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chain-specific transcript levels were quantified by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and mutation identification was performed by sequencing of complementary DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ColVI secretion was altered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fibroblast cultures studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We identified 56 mutations, mostly novel and private </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dominant de novo mutations were detected in 61% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, mutations causing premature termination codons (PTCs) or in-frame insertions strikingly destabilized the corresponding transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Homozygous PTC-causing mutations in the triple helix domains led to the most severe phenotypes (ambulation never achieved), whereas dominant de novo in-frame exon skipping and glycine missense mutations were identified in patients of the moderate-progressive group (loss of ambulation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: This work emphasizes that the diagnosis of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> ColVI <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> is arduous and time-consuming, and demonstrates that quantitative RT-PCR is a helpful tool for the identification of some mutation-bearing genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the clinical classification proposed allowed genotype-phenotype relationships to be explored, and may be useful in the design of future clinical trials </plain></SENT>
