<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Defective O-mannosylation causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002269'>abnormal neuronal migration</z:hpo> [Walker-Warburg syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e>)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we have identified and cloned rat Pomt1 and Pomt2, which are homologues of human POMT1 and POMT2, with identities of 86 and 90%, respectively, at the amino acid level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coexpression of both genes was found to be necessary for enzymatic activity, as is the case with human POMT1 and POMT2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Northern blot and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses revealed that rat Pomt1 and Pomt2 are expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tissues but most strongly in testis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization histochemistry of rat brain revealed that Pomt1 and Pomt2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> are coexpressed in neurons (dentate gyrus and CA1-CA3 region of the hippocampus and cerebellar Purkinje cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two transcription-initiation sites were observed in rat Pomt2, resulting in two forms: a testis form and a somatic form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The two forms had equal protein O-mannosyltransferase activity when coexpressed with rat Pomt1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Coexpression studies also showed that the human and rat protein O-mannosyltransferases are interchangeable, providing further evidence for the closeness of their structures </plain></SENT>
