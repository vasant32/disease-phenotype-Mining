<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have reported breaches of glia limitans (GL)-basal lamina (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) complex with protruding neuroglial tissue in Fukuyama-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD) fetus brain and suggested that some basic deficits in the GL-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> complex may have a pivotal role in formation of micropolygyria in FCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the cerebral GL-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> complex in seven FCMD cases (12-27 years of age), in three cases of Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (17-25 years of age) and in two non-neurological controls (28 and 33 years of age) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frontal lobe cortex was examined immunocytochemically using antibodies against collagen type IV and laminin in each case, and ultrastructurally in an adult case of FCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In FCMD, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> of the cortical surface was frequently breached with protruding neural tissue that ultrastructurally showed frequent synapses, neurites that had parallel arranged microtubules, and astrocytic processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The outermost surface of this tissue was only partly lined by a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the region of the gyral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of micropolygyria, the perivascular space of the apparently entrapped meningeal blood vessels was occupied by neuroglial tissue, which is assumed to have invaded through the occasionally seen breaches of the perivascular GL-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy of the intruding tissue showed frequent synapses, microtubule-containing neurites and astrocytic processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No breached GL-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> complex was found in any of the non-FCMD cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that in FCMD, the cerebral GL-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> complex continues to have a crucial deficit with resulting breaches through which neuroglial tissue protrudes, promoting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of the adjacent cerebral gyri during brain development before and after birth </plain></SENT>
