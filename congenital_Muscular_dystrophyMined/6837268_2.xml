<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This method was applied to muscle biopsies from 65 patients who suffered from various childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852419,C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fibers showed dull green cytoplasm with small green-yellow nuclei, striking fluorescent fibers were observed in eight cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) and 12 cases of Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD); these fibers were characterized as follows: (1) small fibers with big oval or spherical nuclei which fluoresced strongly with a bright orange color; (2) fibers of various sizes and different degrees of orange fluorescence; and (3) opaque fibers with bright yellow cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The small diameter fibers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Werdnig-Hoffmann</z:e> (WH) disease, nemaline <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546264" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">congenital fiber type disproportion</z:e> failed to show apparent AO-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> fluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the atrophic fibers in Kugelberg-Welander (KW) disease showed a vague orange fluorescent color, this was obviously different from that of regenerating fibers seen in CMD and DMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to these findings, the hypertrophic fibers in a case of unclassified <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> also showed moderate orange fluorescence around the entire periphery of the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
