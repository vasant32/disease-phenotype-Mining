<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We recently described a novel <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) syndrome characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo>, and partial merosin deficiency on muscle biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Linkage analysis excluded involvement of the known CMD loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now report on a study performed on the differentiation of cultured myoblasts from one patient affected by this condition to evaluate the potential to form myotubes and merosin processing in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The differentiation rate was comparable to controls and myotubes were stable in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biochemical analysis showed the expected 80-kDa merosin subunit in myoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, a shifted 60-kDa protein was detected in myotubes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs) zymography showed increased gelatinolytic activity, and immunoblotting identified an increased amount of membrane-type 1 matrix-metalloproteinase in pathological myotube preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results show that these CMD-derived myotubes contain a low molecular weight merosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They further suggest that an altered regulation of MMPs can be involved in basal lamina damage </plain></SENT>
