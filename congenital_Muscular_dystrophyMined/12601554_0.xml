<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately one half of cases diagnosed with classic CMD show primary deficiency of the laminin alpha2 chain of merosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complete absence of this protein is usually associated with a severe phenotype characterized by drastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> and characteristic changes in white matter in cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we report an 8-month-old Mexican female infant, from a consanguineous family, with classical CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase was elevated, muscle biopsy showed dystrophic changes, and there were abnormalities in brain MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated the complete absence of laminin alpha2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, expression of alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-sarcoglycans and dystrophin, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> components of the dystrophin-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> complex, appeared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A homozygous C long right arrow T substitution at position 7781 that generated a stop codon in the G domain of the protein was identified by mutation analysis of the laminin alpha2 gene ( LAMA2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis on available DNA samples of the family showed that parents and other relatives were carriers of the mutation </plain></SENT>
