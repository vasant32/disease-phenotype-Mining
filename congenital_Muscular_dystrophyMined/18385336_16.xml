<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many of these inherited disorders share a common etiology: defective O-glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, a component of the dystrophin complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Protein-O-mannosyl transferase 1 (POMT1) is the first enzyme required for the glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, and mutations in the POMT1 gene can lead to both Walker-Warburg syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> type 2K (LGMD2K) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo> and major structural abnormalities in the brain; however, LGMD2K patients display a more mild retardation with no obvious structural defects in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a screen for synaptic mutants in Drosophila, we identified mutations in the Drosophila ortholog of POMT1, dPOMT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because synaptic defects are a plausible cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, we investigated the molecular and physiological defects associated with loss of dPOMT1 in Drosophila </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In dPOMT1 mutants, there is a decrease in the efficacy of synaptic transmission and a change in the subunit composition of the postsynaptic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptors at the neuromuscular junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that dPOMT1 is required to glycosylate the Drosophila dystroglycan ortholog Dg in vivo, and that this is the likely cause of these synaptic defects because (1) mutations in Dg lead to similar synaptic defects and (2) genetic interaction studies suggest that dPOMT1 and Dg function in the same pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with the model that dPOMT1-dependent glycosylation of Dg is necessary for proper synaptic function and raise the possibility that similar synaptic defects occur in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
