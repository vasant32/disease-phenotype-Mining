<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients presented with severe <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> at birth, associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>delayed development</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They could walk independently and managed to maintain walking after 13 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their muscle immunohistochemistry differed from that seen in Duchenne and Becher <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD and BMD), severe childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (SCARMD) due to sarcoglycan deficiency (sarcoglycanopathies), and lamininalpha2 (merosin)-deficient CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, both patients had associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiography (ECG) in Salih CMD was characterized by delayed atrioventricular (AV) conduction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011711'>left anterior fascicular block</z:hpo> (left axis deviation), and left atrial enlargement without evidence of atrial dysarrhythmia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography showed features of severe left ventricular dysfunction with estimated left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25% at 16 years-of-age in the older patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A year later, multigated aquisition MUGA scan showed LVEF of 21% and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the right ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography and MUGA scan were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the younger patient at 15 years-of-age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ECG, echocardiography, and MUGA scan are effective techniques for diagnosing and monitoring the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in Salih CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They can also distinguish it from features seen in the other common forms of MD, including DMD, BMD, and sarcoglycanopathies </plain></SENT>
