<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the human gene (LARGE) have been described in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> type 1D (MDC1D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in four other genes that encode known or putative glycosylation enzymes (POMT1, POMGnT1, fukutin and FKRP) are also associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these diseases hypoglycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, and consequent loss of ligand binding, is a common pathomechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Currently, the Large(myd) mouse is the principal animal model for studying the underlying molecular mechanisms of this group of disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over-expression of LARGE in cells from patients with mutations in POMT1 or POMGnT1 results in hyperglycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan and restoration of laminin binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, LARGE is a potential therapeutic target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Here, we define the intronic deletion breakpoints of the Large(myd) mutation and describe a simple, PCR-based diagnostic assay, facilitating the study of this important animal model </plain></SENT>
