<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and protein studies were performed in blood macrophages from 5 patients previously diagnosed with either Ullrich <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (UCMD) or Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (BM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The full spectrum of possible genotypes was considered, including both dominant and recessive UCMD and BM cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the dominant BM patient, no collagen VI alterations were detectable in macrophages or muscle biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the remaining patients, the protein defect caused by the selected mutations, as well as the transcriptional abnormalities, were readily detectable in macrophages, at levels comparable to those observed in muscle biopsy samples and cultured skin fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the suitability of peripheral blood macrophages as a reliable, minimally invasive tool for supplementing or replacing muscle/skin biopsies in the diagnosis and monitoring of collagen VI-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
