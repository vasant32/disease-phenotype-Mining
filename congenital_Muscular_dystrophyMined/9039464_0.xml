<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A particular form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> is associated with a deficiency of the tissue-specific basement membrane protein laminin alpha 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A more precise knowledge of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> distribution and localization of laminin alpha 2 would be useful in further elucidating the development of this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we used specific electron microscopic techniques, i.e., thin-section fracture labeling and cryoultramicrotomy in combination with immunogold labeling for laminin alpha 2, to determine its ultrastructural localization in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human muscle and peripheral nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both in muscle and in peripheral nerve, laminin alpha 2 is found to be associated solely with the basal lamina of myofibers and Schwann cells, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of special interest is the finding that in peripheral nerve, laminin alpha 2 is associated only with myelinated and not with unmyelinated nerve fibers </plain></SENT>
