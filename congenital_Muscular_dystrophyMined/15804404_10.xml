<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the expression of the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-dependent high-affinity <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transporters EAAT1, EAAT2, and EAAT3 in 11 human autopsied cases without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> and in four cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007260'>type II lissencephaly</z:hpo> including Walker Warburg's syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e>) and Fukuyama-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD), both of which are classified as migration disorders of the human brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transporter subtypes was differentially regulated during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human corticogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although EAAT1 and EAAT2 were mainly localized to the cortical astrocytes in the postnatal brain, EAAT1 was enriched in the proliferative zones and radial glia from 13 gestational weeks (GW) to 20 GW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EAAT2 was abundant in the intermediate zone until 23 GW, and transiently expressed in the radial fibers of the transitional form of radial glia into mature astrocytes as well as partly in the corticofugal axonal bundles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EAAT3 immunoreactivity was robust in the apical dendrites of the pyramidal neurons in the marginal zone and cortical plate during corticogenesis, and decreased postnatally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007260'>type II lissencephaly</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transporters were expressed in the extrusion of neuroglial tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bundles of EAAT2-immunoreactive radial fibers were prominent in the specimens at 20 GW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transporters are differentially regulated during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and impaired corticogenesis </plain></SENT>
