<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> is a well-defined clinical entity among collagen VI disorders, featuring <z:hpo ids='HP_0003701'>proximal muscle weakness</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo> of the fingers, wrists, and ankles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is an early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo>, and relatively mild disease, invariably associated to date with heterozygous dominant mutations in the 3 collagen VI genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have characterized the clinical, laboratory, and genetic features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> in 2 unrelated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study is based on clinical, histochemical, immunocytochemical, and electron microscope evaluation of the muscle and dermal fibroblasts, CT imaging of the muscles, and biochemical and molecular analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both patients carry a truncating COL6A2 mutation (Q819X; R366X) associated with missense changes in the partnering allele lying within the C2 domain of the alpha2(VI) chain (D871N; R843W-R830Q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They show decreased amounts of collagen VI in the basal lamina of muscle fibers and in dermal fibroblast cultures and altered behavior of collagen VI tetramers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biochemical studies supported the pathogenic effect of identified amino acid substitutions, which involve strictly conserved residues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The reported patients illustrate the occurrence of Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with a recessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This observation completes the hereditary pattern in collagen VI <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> with both Ullrich <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> underlined by either recessive or dominant effecting mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding has relevant implications for genetic counseling and molecular characterization of patients with Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, as well as for genotype-phenotype correlations in collagen VI disorders </plain></SENT>
