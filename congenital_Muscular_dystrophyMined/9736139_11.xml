<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> have a deficiency of the laminin alpha2 chain of merosin, an extracellular matrix protein linked to dystrophin through a group of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that deficiency in one of these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> is responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Children with laminin alpha2 deficiency may be at risk for development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied the cardiac function of a cohort of 16 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> by using 2-dimensional echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of the laminin alpha2 of merosin in the patients was determined on a skin or muscle biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of 6 merosin-deficient children had an ejection fraction &lt;40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average ejection fraction of the merosin-deficient children was 43%+/-11%, which was significantly lower than the merosin-positive children (53%+/-5%, P=.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that a deficiency of laminin alpha2 can give rise to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, supporting the idea that defects of dystrophin, or of associated proteins, can cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in addition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
