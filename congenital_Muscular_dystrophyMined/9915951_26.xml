<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A similar combination of muscle and brain involvement is also seen in Walker-Warburg syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e>) and Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whereas the gene underlying FCMD has been mapped and cloned, the genetic location of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> gene is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we report the assignment of the MEB gene to chromosome 1p32-p34 by linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping in eight families with 12 affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a genomewide search for linkage in four affected sib pairs had pinpointed the assignment to 1p, the MEB locus was more precisely assigned to a 9-cM interval flanked by markers D1S200 proximally and D1S211 distally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multipoint linkage analysis gave a maximum LOD score of 6.17 at locus D1S2677 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings provide a starting point for the positional cloning of the disease gene, which may play an important role in muscle function and brain development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It also provides an opportunity to test other <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> phenotypes, in particular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e>, for linkage to the same locus </plain></SENT>
