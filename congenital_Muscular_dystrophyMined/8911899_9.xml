<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The crossshaped proteins consist of a heavy alpha-chain and two light chains, called beta and gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each group of chains, classified on their sequence identity and domain organization, include different isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A deficiency of the alpha 2 chain of laminin-2, previously termed merosin or M component, was shown to be responsible for one form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated muscle biopsies of 20 patients with the clinical diagnosis of CMD and histological evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> for the expression of different laminin chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001302'>pachygyria</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001339'>lissencephaly</z:hpo> of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> were excluded from this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemical analysis was correlated to clinical findings and MRI data of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 20 patients, 11 (55%) revealed complete or near-complete deficiency of the alpha 2 chain in their skeletal muscle specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>So far none of these patients became ambulant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 20 patients 2 showed partial but clear-cut alpha 2 chain-deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These two patients became ambulant at 18 months and 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 13 patients with complete or partial alpha 2 chain-deficiency demonstrated cerebral white matter changes on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 6/7 CMD patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alpha 2 chain expression became ambulant and none of the 6/7 tested showed evidence of cerebral abnormal T2 sequence signal of the myelin on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings emphasize the use of immunohistochemistry for laminin alpha 2 as a diagnostic tool in defining CMD and characterize a milder phenotype with partial alpha 2 chain-deficiency </plain></SENT>
