<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported a large consanguineous family segregating merosin-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, in which involvement of known CMD loci was excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A genome-wide linkage search of the family conducted using microsatellite markers spaced at 10-Mb intervals failed to identify a disease locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A second scan using a high-density SNP array, however, permitted a novel CMD locus on 4p16.3 to be identified (multipoint LOD score 3.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four additional consanguineous CMD families with a similar phenotype were evaluated for linkage to a 4.14-Mb interval on 4p16.3; however, none showed any evidence of linkage to the region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings further illustrate the utility of highly informative SNP arrays compared with standard panels of microsatellite markers for the mapping of recessive disease loci </plain></SENT>
