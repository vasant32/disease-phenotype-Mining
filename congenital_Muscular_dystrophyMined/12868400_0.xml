<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CMDs were classified into five clinically distinct forms: the two classical CMDs with and without deficit of the a2 laminin chain (merosin) caused by mutations on chromosome 6q2, the Fukuyama CMD (severe form, initially described in Japanese patients and recently linked to the chromosome 9q31-33), Walker-Warburg syndrome and the muscle-eye-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> described in Finnish patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The majority of these forms have severe clinical and imagiological involvement of SNC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This aspect is rarely observed on classical CMD, particularly in the merosin-positive form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We describe a case of a 28 year-old woman, with clinical and histopathological signs of classical CMD merosin-positive (no deficient), without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, but with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI T2 weighted images, revealed diffuse and symetrical high signal white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, affecting corpos calosum, posterior arms of internal capsules and the piramidal tract to mesencephalon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It also disclosed diffuse and symetrical high signal of basal ganglia, specially, the head of caudate nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These were associated with bilateral occipital posterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The observed imagiological pattern could represent a new subtype of CMD, hybrid between classical CMD and the severe forms, however it is not clear where it fits in the spectrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This case denotes the possible envolvement of SNC in patients merosin-positives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on this findings we suggest doing MRI scans to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with CMD no deficient in merosin </plain></SENT>
