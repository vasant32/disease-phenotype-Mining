<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a series of 12 patients from eight families with CNM in whom we have identified a number of novel features that expand the reported clinicopathological phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified two novel and five recurrent missense mutations in DNM2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early clues to the diagnosis include relative <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of neck flexors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000544'>external ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>ptosis</z:hpo>, although these are not present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001761'>Pes cavus</z:hpo> was present in two patients, and in another two members of one family there was mild slowing of nerve conduction velocities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whole-body MRI examination in two children and one adult revealed a similar pattern of involvement of selective muscles in head (lateral pterygoids), neck (extensors), trunk (paraspinal) and upper limbs (deep muscles of forearm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Findings in lower limbs and pelvic region were similar to that previously reported in adults with DNM2 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients presented with dystrophic changes as the predominant pathological feature on muscle biopsies; one of whom had a moderately raised <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase, and both patients were initially diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DNM2 mutation analysis should be considered in patients with a suggestive clinical phenotype despite atypical histopathology, and MRI findings can be used to guide genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subtle neuropathic features in some patients suggest an overlap with the DNM2 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Missense mutations in the C-terminal region of the PH domain appear to be associated with a more severe clinical phenotype evident from infancy </plain></SENT>
