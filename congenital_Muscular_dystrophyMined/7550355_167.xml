<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histological changes seen in muscle biopsies consist of large variations in muscle fibre size, a few necrotic and regenerating fibres and a marked increase in endomysial collagen tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis is based on clinical features and on morphological changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In several CMD cases, we have demonstrated an absence of one of the components of the extracellular matrix around muscle fibres, the merosin M chain, now referred to as the alpha 2 chain of laminin-2 (ref.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We localized this CMD locus to chromosome 6q2 by homozygosity mapping and linkage analysis </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated LAMA2 for the presence of disease-causing mutations in laminin alpha 2 chain-deficient CMD families and now report splice site and nonsense mutations in two families leading presumably to a truncated laminin alpha 2 protein </plain></SENT>
