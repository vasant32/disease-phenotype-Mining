<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Prenatal diagnosis was carried out in five merosin-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied both laminin-alpha 2 chain expression in trophoblast using immunocytochemistry and linkage analysis to the LAMA2 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In four families there was good agreement between the immunocytochemistry and linkage analysis results: in one case the trophoblast was negative for LAMA2 expression and haplotype analysis suggested the foetus was affected; in the other three cases the laminin-alpha 2 chain expression was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and foetuses were found to be carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the remaining family, a case of partial laminin-alpha 2 chain expression, the immunostaining of the trophoblast was weaker compared to the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linkage analysis, however, could not be performed because of maternal DNA contamination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After termination of pregnancy, the foetal muscle was studied and suggested weak laminin-alpha 2 chain expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The haplotype analysis however showed that the foetus was probably a carrier, unless a double recombinant event had occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that a combination of immunocytochemistry and linkage analysis can be used for the prenatal diagnosis of merosin deficient CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results are easy to interpret in families with total absence of the protein, while caution is required when dealing with families where partial expression occurs </plain></SENT>
