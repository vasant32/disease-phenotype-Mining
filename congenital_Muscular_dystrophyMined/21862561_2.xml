<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Radial sorting is impaired in models of human diseases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (MDC) 1A, MDC1D and Fukuyama, owing to loss-of-function mutations in the genes coding for laminin α2, Large or fukutin glycosyltransferases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is not clear which receptor(s) are activated by laminin 211, or glycosylated by Large and fukutin during sorting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Candidates are αβ1 integrins, because their absence phenocopies laminin and glycosyltransferase deficiency, but the topography of the phenotypes is different and β1 integrins are not substrates for Large and fukutin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By contrast, deletion of the Large and fukutin substrate dystroglycan does not result in radial sorting defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that absence of dystroglycan in a specific genetic background causes sorting defects with topography identical to that of laminin 211 mutants, and recapitulating the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e>, MDC1D and Fukuyama phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By epistasis studies in mice lacking one or both receptors in SCs, we show that only absence of β1 integrins impairs proliferation and survival, and arrests radial sorting at early stages, that β1 integrins and dystroglycan activate different pathways, and that the absence of both molecules is synergistic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the function of dystroglycan and β1 integrins is not redundant, but is sequential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data identify dystroglycan as a functional laminin 211 receptor during axonal sorting and the key substrate relevant to the pathogenesis of glycosyltransferase <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
