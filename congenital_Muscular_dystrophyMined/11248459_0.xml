<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We here report on three CMD patients who underwent a longitudinal evaluation of clinical and neuroimaging features for a mean period of 18 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Case 1, a 22-year-old woman, and cases 2 and 3, brothers aged 26 and 20 years, respectively, had presented a mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscular weakness</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003236'>increased serum creatine kinase</z:hpo> (CK) levels since birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were diagnosed in the first years of life, with identification of evident dystrophic changes at muscle biopsy and moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001321'>cerebellar hypoplasia</z:hpo> at brain computed tomography (CT) scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients underwent a second muscle biopsy, with immunostaining and immunoblot analysis, which showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values for merosin, dystrophin and dystrophin-related proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the longitudinal study, the patients underwent repeated neurological and psychiatric examinations, serum CK controls, intellectual ability assessments and neuroimaging evaluations (CT and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, these investigations indicated a mild to moderate deficit in the proximal muscles and a clear-cut <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar syndrome</z:e> which, it was assumed, had been present since the first years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients also presented some intellectual difficulties, with an IQ of 0.69 in case 1, 0.83 in case 2 and 0.61 in case 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients was static, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> symptoms of the combined muscle and brain involvement persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nor were any changes in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001321'>cerebellar hypoplasia</z:hpo> observed at repeat MRIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Findings obtained by us on the longitudinal study and a review of the literature indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001321'>cerebellar hypoplasia</z:hpo> and merosin-positive CMD constitute a particular clinical phenotype, mainly characterized by an ataxic syndrome associated with a non-severe muscular involvement and a possible mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>intellectual impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
