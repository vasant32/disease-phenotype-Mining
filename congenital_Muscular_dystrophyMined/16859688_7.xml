<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Green fluorescent protein (GFP) mice were used as donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In mdx mice, BMT failed to produce any significant differences in muscle pathology, although some GFP-positive fibers with restored dystrophin expression were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in the dy mice, BMT led to a significant increase in lifespan and an increase in growth rate, muscle strength, and respiratory function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that BMT improved outcome in dy mice but not mdx mice </plain></SENT>
