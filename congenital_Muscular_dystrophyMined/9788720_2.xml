<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> merosin deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD), as opposed to the merosin positive cases form a homogeneous subgroup of a clinically more severe form of CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined merosin expression in muscle biopsies from five children with the severe classical form of CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Merosin deficiency was found only in 1 patient, a 6-year-old female, with abnormal brain myelination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, her initial biopsy did not reveal the classical picture of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The four merosin positive cases exhibited severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> but their brain imagings were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no familial cases, except for the mother of 1 patient who had a milder form of the disease, suggesting an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to previous reports, the merosin deficient CMD cases were rare in our group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, merosin positive cases were also associated with severe phenotype suggesting that a severe phenotype is not exclusive to merosin deficient cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, the absence of merosin in a neonate with <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> can be helpful in making a definitive diagnosis of CMD, even though the dystrophic process may not be evident yet and histology may be non-specific </plain></SENT>
