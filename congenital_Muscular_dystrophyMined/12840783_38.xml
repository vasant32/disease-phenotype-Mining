<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recessive mutations in two of the three collagen VI genes, COL6A2 and COL6A3, have recently been shown to cause Ullrich <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (UCMD), a frequently severe disorder characterized by congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>joint contractures</z:hpo> and coexisting distal joint hyperlaxity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dominant mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three collagen VI genes had previously been associated with the considerably milder Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report that a de novo heterozygous deletion of the COL6A1 gene can also result in a severe phenotype of classical UCMD precluding ambulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The internal gene deletion occurs near a minisatellite DNA sequence in intron 8 that removes 1.1 kb of genomic DNA encompassing exons 9 and 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The resulting mutant chain contains a 33-amino acid deletion near the amino-terminus of the triple-helical domain but preserves a unique cysteine in the triple-helical domain important for dimer formation prior to secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, dimer formation and secretion of abnormal tetramers can occur and exert a strong dominant negative effect on microfibrillar assembly, leading to a loss of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> localization of collagen VI in the basement membrane surrounding muscle fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this mechanism was our analysis of a patient with a much milder phenotype, in whom we identified a previously described Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> heterozygous in-frame deletion of 18 amino acids somewhat downstream in the triple-helical domain, a result of exon 14 skipping in the COL6A1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This deletion removes the crucial cysteine, so that dimer formation cannot occur and the abnormal molecule is not secreted, preventing the strong dominant negative effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our studies provide a biochemical insight into genotype-phenotype correlations in this group of disorders and establish that UCMD can be caused by dominantly acting mutations </plain></SENT>
