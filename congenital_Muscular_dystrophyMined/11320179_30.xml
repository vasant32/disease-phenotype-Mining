<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Three rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> disorders share the combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and brain malformations including a neuronal migration defect: muscle-eye-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> (MEB), Walker-Warburg syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e>), and Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, ocular abnormalities are a constant feature in MEB and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lack of consistent ocular abnormalities in FCMD has allowed a clear clinical demarcation of this syndrome, whereas the phenotypic distinction between MEB and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> has remained controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The MEB gene is located on chromosome 1p32-p34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To establish distinguishing diagnostic criteria for MEB and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> and to determine whether MEB and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> are allelic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors undertook clinical characterization followed by linkage analysis in 19 MEB/WWS families with 29 affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With use of clinical diagnostic criteria based on Finnish patients with MEB, each patient was categorized as having either MEB or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A linkage and haplotype analysis using 10 markers spanning the MEB locus was performed on the entire family resource </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients in 11 families were classified as having MEB and in 8 families as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Strong evidence in favor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> was obtained in the 19 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was evidence for linkage to 1p32-p34 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 1 of the 11 pedigrees segregating the MEB phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, linkage to the MEB locus was excluded in seven of eight of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results allow the classification of MEB and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> as distinct disorders on both clinical and genetic grounds and provide a basis for the mapping of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> gene(s) </plain></SENT>
