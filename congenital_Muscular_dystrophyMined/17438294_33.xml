<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are currently three models for the molecular basis of cellular pathology in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e>: (i) lack of LAMA2 leads to sarcolemmal <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and failure, followed by <z:mp ids='MP_0000316'>cellular necrosis</z:mp>, as is the case in Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD); (ii) loss of LAMA2-mediated signaling during the development and maintenance of muscle tissue results in myoblast proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_71'>fusion defects</z:mpath>; (iii) loss of LAMA2 from the basement membrane of the Schwann cells surrounding the peripheral nerves results in a lack of motor stimulation, leading to effective denervation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that the degenerative <z:mp ids='MP_0005369'>muscle phenotype</z:mp> in the zebrafish dystrophic mutant, candyfloss (caf) results from mutations in the laminin alpha2 (lama2) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vivo time-lapse analysis of mechanically loaded fibers and membrane permeability assays suggest that, unlike DMD, fiber detachment is not initially associated with sarcolemmal rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early muscle formation and myoblast fusion are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, indicating that any deficiency in early Lama2 signaling does not lead to muscle pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, innervation by the primary motor neurons is unaffected, and fiber detachment stems from muscle contraction, demonstrating that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle atrophy</z:hpo> through lack of motor neuron activity does not contribute to pathology in this system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using these and other analyses, we present a model of lama2 function where fiber detachment external to the sarcolemma is mechanically induced, and retracted fibers with uncompromised membranes undergo subsequent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
