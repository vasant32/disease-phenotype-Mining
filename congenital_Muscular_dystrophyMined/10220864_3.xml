<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among these, the laminin alpha 2 chain 'merosin' deficient CMD is caused by mutations of the LAMA2 gene on chr 6q2 and Fukuyama CMD is linked to chr 9q31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a 7-year-old boy who was born to consanguineous healthy parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>His motor and mental development were slow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">Creatine</z:chebi> kinase (CK) was elevated (2.100 U/l), and the muscle biopsy was dystrophic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He sat unsupported at 12 months and took his first steps at 3 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 6 years of age he could walk up to 500 m </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>He was mentally retarded and spoke single words only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 1 year, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging of the brain showed abnormal increased periventricular T2-signal, consistent with dysmyelination as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0007053'>pontocerebellar hypoplasia</z:hpo> and several <z:hpo ids='HP_0002350'>cerebellar cysts</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pattern of gyration was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow-up at 4 years showed normalization of the previously abnormal periventricular T2-signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of the skeletal muscle showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> expression of laminin alpha 2 for a C-terminal antibody and antibodies to the 300 and 150 kDa fragments, as well as of laminins alpha 5, beta 1, beta 2 and gamma 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The boy has two healthy younger brothers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Linkage analysis excluded the candidate loci on chromosomes 6q2 and 9q31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>As such, the patient's data are suggestive of a new form of laminin alpha 2 positive CMD characterized by transient brain dysmyelination, <z:hpo ids='HP_0007053'>pontocerebellar hypoplasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
