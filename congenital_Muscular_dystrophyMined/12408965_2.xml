<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, we identified the gene responsible for FCMD through positional cloning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report the isolation of its murine ortholog, Fcmd </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The predicted amino acid sequence of murine fukutin protein encoded by Fcmd is 90% identical to that of its human counterpart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Radiation hybrid mapping localized the gene to 2.02 cR telomeric to D4Mit272 on chromosome 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of Fcmd in adult mouse tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Through in situ hybridization, we observed a wide distribution of Fcmd expression throughout embryonic development, most predominantly in the central and peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also detected high Fcmd expression in the ventricular zone of proliferating neurons at 13.5 days post-coitum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brain malformation in FCMD patients is thought to result from defective neuronal migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that neuronally expressed Fcmd is likely to be important in the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain structure </plain></SENT>
