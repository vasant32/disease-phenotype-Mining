<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0008305'>Exercise-induced myoglobinuria</z:hpo>, frequently occurring in metabolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo>, has been described in Becker <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and in a few cases of LGMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To describe that episodes with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002913'>myoglobinuria</z:hpo>, often associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003738'>exercise-induced myalgia</z:hpo>, may be common and a presenting symptom in patients with LGMD2I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data on episodes of suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002913'>myoglobinuria</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003326'>myalgia</z:hpo> were collected from the patient records on 14 patients with a diagnosis of LGMDI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five LGMD2I patients reported recurrent episodes of dark urine and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003326'>myalgia</z:hpo> after exercise, and in three of them, this was the only symptom for several years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that episodes compatible with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008305'>exercise-induced myoglobinuria</z:hpo> may be frequent in LGMD2I </plain></SENT>
