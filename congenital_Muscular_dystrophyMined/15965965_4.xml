<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient had been previously demonstrated to express an alpha3(VI) chain shorter than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> due to skipping of the mutated exon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show that collagen VI filaments are not organized in a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> network in the extracellular matrix secreted by patient's cultured fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we demonstrate that in this patient the alpha3(VI) chain is produced in lower amounts and it is almost exclusively represented by the shorter, alternatively spliced N6-C5 isoform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that different alpha3(VI) chain isoforms, containing also domains of the N10-N7 region, are required for assembling a proper collagen VI network in the extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
