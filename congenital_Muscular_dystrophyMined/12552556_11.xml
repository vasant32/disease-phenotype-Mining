<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many loss-of-function mutations have been reported in these severe, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003623'>neonatal-onset</z:hpo> patients, but only single missense mutations have been found in milder CMD with partial laminin alpha2 deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we studied nine patients diagnosed with CMD who showed abnormal white-matter signal at brain MRI and partial deficiency of laminin alpha2 on immunofluorescence of muscle biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We screened the entire 9.5 kb laminin alpha2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> from patient muscle biopsy by direct capillary automated sequencing, single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP), or denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) of overlapping RT-PCR products followed by direct sequencing of heteroduplexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified laminin alpha2 sequence changes in six of nine CMD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each of the gene changes identified, except one, was novel, including three missense changes and two splice-site mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The finding of partial laminin alpha2 deficiency by immunostaining is not specific for laminin alpha2 gene mutation carriers, with only two patients (22%) showing clear causative mutations, and an additional three patients (33%) showing possible mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentation and disease progression was homogeneous in the laminin alpha2-mutation positive and negative CMD patients </plain></SENT>
