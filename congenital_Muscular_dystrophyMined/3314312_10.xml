<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 23-week fetus who is thought to be affected with Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD) is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>Cortical dysplasia</z:hpo> of the cerebrum was extensive and could be categorized into three major types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cerebral cortex was thoroughly covered by glio-mesenchymal tissue (extracortical glial layer), in which neuronal clusters were irregularly scattered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Radial bundles of neuroglial tissue frequently extended from the cortex into the extra-cortical glial layer through the focally defective molecular layer and pia mater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The deep cerebral structures, such as basal ganglia, thalamus and white matter, appeared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in contrast with extensive malformation in the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Glial fibrillary acidic protein-immunoperoxidase stain revealed: (1) presence of abundant radial glial fibers in the ventricular, subventricular and intermediate zones; (2) focal or diffuse lack of glia limitans; (3) focal derangement of radial glial fibers; and (4) proliferation of stellate glial cells in the extra-cortical layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that ectopic accumulation of neurons into the extra-cortical glial layer seems a cardinal pathogenetic process to generate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo> in FCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early development of superficial glio-mesenchymal tissue seems essential for upward displacement of migrating neurons </plain></SENT>
