<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that in laminin-deficient mice, oligodendrocyte development was delayed such that oligodendrocyte progenitors accumulated inappropriately in adult brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conversely, laminin substrates were found to promote the transition of oligodendrocyte progenitors to newly formed oligodendrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laminin-enhanced differentiation was Src family kinase-dependent and resulted in the activation of the Src family kinase Fyn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In laminin-deficient brains, however, increased Fyn repression was accompanied by elevated levels of the Src family kinase negative regulatory proteins, Csk (C-terminal Src kinase), and its transmembrane adaptor, Cbp (Csk-binding protein) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that laminin deficiencies delay oligodendrocyte maturation by causing dysregulation of signaling pathways critical for oligodendrocyte development, and suggest that a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> role for <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> laminin is to promote the development of oligodendrocyte progenitors into myelin-forming oligodendrocytes via modulation of Fyn regulatory molecules </plain></SENT>
