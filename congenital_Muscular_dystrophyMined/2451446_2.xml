<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The neurons in the polymicrogyric cortex from a subject with Fukuyama-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and from a child with <z:mp ids='MP_0002092'>ocular dysplasia</z:mp> (Walker-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0001339'>lissencephaly</z:hpo>) were large, irregularly aligned, and not completely mature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the former condition, the abnormal neuronal arrangement was predominantly in the superficial cortex; in the latter both the superficial and deep cortex were involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These two diseases may have a similar pathogenetic mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In classical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001339'>lissencephaly</z:hpo> without evidence of other disease manifestations, the neurons were arranged in a radial pattern with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002282'>heterotopia</z:hpo> but no large neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of these conditions is discussed </plain></SENT>
