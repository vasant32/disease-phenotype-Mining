<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An important laminin receptor in muscle is integrin alpha7beta1D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Integrin beta1 is expressed throughout the body, while integrin alpha7 is more muscle-specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To address the role of integrin alpha7 in human muscle disease, we determined alpha7 protein expression in muscle biopsies from 117 patients with unclassified congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> by immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found three unrelated patients with integrin alpha7 deficiency and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> laminin alpha2 chain expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine if any of these three patients had mutations of the integrin alpha7 gene, ITGA7, we cloned and sequenced the full-length human ITGA7 cDNA, and screened the patients for mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient had splice mutations on both alleles; one causing a 21-bp insertion in the conserved cysteine-rich region, and the other causing a 98-bp deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A second patient was a compound heterozygote for the same 98-bp deletion, and had a 1-bp frame-shift deletion on the other allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A third showed marked deficiency of ITGA7 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinically, these patients showed congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001270'>delayed motor milestones</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that mutations in ITGA7 are involved in a form of congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
