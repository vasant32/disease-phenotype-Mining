<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed an immunohistochemical and electron microscopy study of a muscle biopsy from a patient affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> carrying a homozygous frameshift mutation in O-mannosyltransferase 1 gene (POMT1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>alpha-Dystroglycan glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> was not detected in muscle fibers and intramuscular peripheral nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Laminin alpha2 chain and perlecan were reduced in muscle fibers and well preserved in intramuscular peripheral nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The basal lamina in several muscle fibers showed discontinuities and detachment from the plasmalemma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most nuclei, including myonuclei and satellite cell nuclei, showed detachment or complete absence of peripheral heterochromatin from the nuclear envelope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic changes were detected in 3% of muscle fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The particular combination of basal lamina and nuclear changes may suggest that a complex pathogenetic mechanism, affecting several subcellular compartments, underlies the degenerative process in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> muscle </plain></SENT>
