<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To characterize the expression of distinct fragments of laminin alpha2 chain in patients with partial laminin alpha2 chain deficiency and variable clinical severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Deficiency of laminin alpha2 chain caused by mutations of the LAMA2 gene on chromosome 6q2 account for approximately 50% of cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) in white patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The complete absence of laminin alpha2 is usually associated with a severe phenotype affecting skeletal muscle and the peripheral and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Quantitative assessment of immunofluorescence to study the expression of C- and N-terminal portions of laminin alpha2 chain in five patients with partial laminin alpha2 chain deficiency and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>variable phenotype</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five patients showed abnormal T2 signal on brain MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry of muscle specimens showed preserved or minimally reduced expression of the C-terminal region of the laminin alpha2 chain (67 to 74%), but a marked reduction of the N-terminal region in four patients (13 to 19%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient with a mild phenotype had a partial reduction (45%) of the C-terminal and the N-terminal (51%) portions of the laminin alpha2 chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients were unable to walk or sit, although the C-terminal portion of the laminin alpha2 chain was expressed at significant levels (67 to 74%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, two patients with a similar expression of the C-terminus (67 to 70%) had a milder phenotype and became ambulatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was impossible to predict the phenotypes in these four patients with a strong expression of the C-terminus and with low levels of the N-terminus based on the amount of protein expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, the laminin beta2 chain was moderately reduced (54 to 75%) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with laminin alpha2 chain deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A strong correlation between the amount of the C-terminus but not for the N-terminus and laminin beta2 reduction could be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: N-terminal antibodies to the laminin alpha2 chain provide a more precise immunohistochemical detection of partially laminin alpha2 chain-deficient CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The secondary reduction of laminin beta2 chain may better define laminin alpha2 chain-deficient CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>More data are needed to predict which portions of C-terminus and midrod region of the laminin alpha2 chain result in a semifunctional protein and a milder phenotype </plain></SENT>
