<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it seems that the nosology of CMD is not complete yet, as we have clinical, immunohistochemical and genetic data suggesting that there are other unclassified forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report two CMD siblings from a consanguineous family with partial merosin-deficiency in muscle biopsies, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MRI of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The disease was not linked to the LAMA2 gene (6q22-23) or to Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD) (9q31-33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, such an association may constitute a new entity within the broad clinical spectrum of CMD </plain></SENT>
