<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>O-mannosyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> are known to play an important role in regulating the function of α-dystroglycan (α-DG), as defective glycosylation is associated with various phenotypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the well-established biological significance of these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi>, questions regarding their precise molecular function remain unanswered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further biological investigation will require synthetic methods for the generation of pure samples of homogeneous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24396">glycopeptides</z:chebi> with diverse sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we describe the first total syntheses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24396">glycopeptides</z:chebi> containing the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50126">tetrasaccharide</z:chebi> NeuNAcα2-3Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-2Manα, which is reported to be the most abundant O-mannosyl glycan on α-DG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our approach is based on biomimetic stepwise assembly from the reducing end and also gives access to the naturally occurring mono-, di-, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27150">trisaccharide</z:chebi> substructures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to the total synthesis, we have developed a "one-pot" enzymatic cascade leading to the rapid synthesis of the target <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50126">tetrasaccharide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, solid-phase synthesis of the desired <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24396">glycopeptides</z:chebi> directly on a gold microarray platform is described </plain></SENT>
