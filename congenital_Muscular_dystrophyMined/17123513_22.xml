<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026848" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">muscular diseases</z:e> are characterized by early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> which predominantly affect in axial muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used zebrafish as a model system to understand the function of SelN in muscle formation during embryogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Zebrafish SelN is highly homologous to its human counterpart and amino acids corresponding to the mutated positions in human muscle diseases are conserved in the zebrafish protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sepn1 gene is highly expressed in the somites and notochord during early development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of the sepn1 gene by injection of antisense morpholinos does not alter the fate of the muscular tissue, but causes muscle architecture disorganization and greatly reduced motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural analysis of the myotomes reveals defects in muscle sarcomeric organization and in myofibers attachment, as well as altered myoseptum integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrate the important role of SelN for muscle organization during early development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, alteration of myofibrils architecture and tendon-like structure in embryo deficient for SelN function provide new insights into the pathological mechanism of SelN-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
