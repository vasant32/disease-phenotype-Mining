<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Extracellular matrix, <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>-related molecules and histopathology were assessed in skeletal muscle of patients with Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD), Becker <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (BMD), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> type 1A (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e>).Osteopontin expression was much higher in DMD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> than in BMD and control muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Osteopontin was expressed in mononuclear cell infiltrates, on some muscle fibre surfaces, in regenerating fibres, and in calcified fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pathological muscles, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 was increased around groups of fibres that were also characterized by absence of collagen 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The amounts of MMP-2, MMP-9 and tissue inhibitor of MMP -1 transcripts were also increased, whereas their proteins were variably expressed in muscle fibres (surface or cytoplasm) and at foci of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory cells, fibroblasts and myofibroblasts were more numerous in DMD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> than in BMD muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Several <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>-related factors are greatly altered in severely dystrophic skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Osteopontin was the most conspicuously upregulated, both as transcript and as protein, in muscle fibres and infiltrating cells, indicating an intimate involvement in <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, and also in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000750'>muscle regeneration</z:mp>, although its precise roles in these processes remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
