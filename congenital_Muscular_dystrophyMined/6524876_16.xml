<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We localized calcium and albumin as endogenous markers of extracellular fluid penetration and C3 and C9 complement components as markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003713'>muscle fiber necrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In both Duchenne <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, a significant percentage of fibers were overloaded with calcium and penetrated by albumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of these fibers appeared opaque with trichrome stain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>C3 and C9 complement components appeared only in necrotic fibers, which invariably were also penetrated by albumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These observations support previous findings that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003713'>muscle fiber necrosis</z:hpo> is linked to massive inflow of extracellular fluid and complement activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, in both Duchenne and congenital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophies</z:mpath>, numerous nonnecrotic fibers are penetrated by calcium-rich extracellular fluid </plain></SENT>
