<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FCMD is the second most common form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and one of the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> diseases among the Japanese population; however, no typical FCMD cases have been reported in any other population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we report on the first identification of a Chinese FCMD patient; our findings are supported by clinical, histological, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence, as well as fukutin gene mutational analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001319'>neonatal hypotonia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, and delayed motor and speech development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional testing revealed cerebral and cerebellar gyrus abnormalities with white matter signal intensity changes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003236'>elevated serum creatine kinase</z:hpo> (CK) levels, and dystrophic skeletal muscle with alpha-dystroglycan hypoglycosylation, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> beta-dystroglycan and merosin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genetic analysis of the fukutin gene showed one copy with a Japanese <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> 3-kilobase (kb) retrotransposal insertion in the 3'-non-coding region and the other copy with a known c.139C&gt;T mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the first FCMD case reported in the Chinese population and the first case in which the 3-kb insertion has been found outside of the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This report emphasizes the importance of considering the fukutin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutation for diagnostic purposes outside of Japan </plain></SENT>
