<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To characterise the natural history of Ullrich <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (UCMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Questionnaire-based nationwide survey to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5442 certified paediatric and adult neurologists in Japan was conducted from October 2010 to February 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We enrolled the 33 patients (age at assessment, 11±6.6 years) who were reported to have collagen VI deficiency on immunohistochemistry in muscle biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analysed the development, clinical manifestations, Cobb angle and %vital capacity (%VC) in spirogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cobb angle over 30° was noted at age 9.9±5.3 years (n=17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The maximum progression rate was 16.2±10°/year (n=13). %VC was decreased exponentially with age, resulting in severe respiratory dysfunction before pubescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>Scoliosis</z:hpo> surgery was performed in 3 patients at ages 5 years, 9 years and 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperative %VC was relatively well maintained in the youngest patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Non-invasive ventilation was initiated at age 11.2±3.6 years (n=13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five (81%) of 31 patients walked independently by age 1.7±0.5 years but lost this ability by age 8.8±2.9 years (n=11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six patients never walked independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The natural history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, respiratory function and walking ability in UCMD patients were characterised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> varied, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, as well as restrictive respiratory dysfunction, progressed rapidly within years, once they appeared </plain></SENT>
