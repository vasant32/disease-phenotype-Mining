<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Compartmentalization of myelin-forming Schwann cells may favor elongation of myelin segments to the size required for efficient conduction of nerve impulses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compartments in myelinated fibers were described by Ram√≥n y Cajal and depend on periaxin, mutated in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598589" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hereditary neuropathy</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007959" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease</z:e> type 4F (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007959" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Charcot-Marie-Tooth</z:e> 4F) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lack of periaxin in mice causes loss of compartments, formation of short myelin segments (internodes) and <z:mp ids='MP_0008814'>reduced nerve conduction velocity</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>How compartments are formed and maintained, and their relevance to human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathies</z:e> is largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we show that formation of compartments around myelin is driven by the actin cytoskeleton, and maintained by actin and tubulin fences through linkage to the dystroglycan complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compartmentalization and establishment of correct internodal length requires the presence of glycosylated dystroglycan, utrophin and extracellular laminin-2/211 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A neuropathic patient with reduced internodal length and nerve conduction velocity because of absence of laminin-2/211 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> 1A) also shows abnormal compartmentalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data link formation of compartments through a laminin2, dystroglycan, utrophin, actin axis to internodal length, and provide a common pathogenetic mechanism for two inherited human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other cell types may exploit dystroglycan complexes in similar fashions to create barriers and compartments </plain></SENT>
