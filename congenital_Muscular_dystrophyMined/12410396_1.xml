<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some recent studies found that CMD patients have a white matter disorder and cerebellum <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the spinal cord of dy mice, a model of CMD, inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) was markedly expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using Western blotting and immunohistochemical analyses, we investigated the levels of neurotrophin-4 (NT-4), brain-derived neurotrophic factor, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and skeletal muscles of dy mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the dy mice, the microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) protein level was markedly decreased in the Purkinje and granule cells of the cerebellum, and in lumbar motoneurons of the spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The motoneurons and axons of dy mice possessed lower expressions of phosphorylated tau </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The amount of NT-4 was markedly lower in the cerebellum, spinal cord and hindlimb muscles of dy mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In dy mice, GDNF was markedly enhanced in the Purkinje and granule cells of the cerebellum, in many lumbar motoneurons, and in the regenerating atrophied fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CNTF protein level did not differ in the hindlimb muscles between the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and dy mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, GDNF could act to inhibit the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of Purkinje and granular neurons, and motoneurons, and to promote the remodeling of the neuromuscular junction of atrophied muscle fibers of dy mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, dy mice include neurogenic abnormalities in the cerebellum and spinal cord along with myogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026848" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disorder of muscle</z:e> fibers </plain></SENT>
