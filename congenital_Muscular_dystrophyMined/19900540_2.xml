<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The FKRP gene encodes a putative glycosyltransferase, but its precise localization and functions have yet to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we demonstrated that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> FKRP is secreted into culture medium and mutations alter the pattern of secretion in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>L276I mutation associated with mild disease phenotype was shown to reduce the level of secretion whereas P448L and C318Y mutations associated with severe disease phenotype almost abolished the secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, a truncated FKRP mutant protein lacking the entire C-terminal 185 amino acids due to the E310X nonsense mutation was able to secrete as efficiently as the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> FKRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The N-terminal signal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> sequence is apparently cleaved from the secreted FKRP proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Alteration of the secretion pathway by different mutations and spontaneous read-through of nonsense mutation may contribute to wide variations in phenotypes associated with FKRP-related diseases </plain></SENT>
