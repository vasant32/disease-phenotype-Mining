<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Laminin-2 (merosin) is a heterotrimer composed of alpha 2, beta 1 and gamma 1 chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately half of the cases with the classical form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) have a deficiency of the laminin alpha 2 chain, encoded by the LAMA2 gene on chromosome 6q22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This disorder is often termed merosin-deficient CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Skeletal and cardiac muscle, and the peripheral and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> systems, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> express laminin alpha 2 and can be affected in merosin-deficient CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> skin also expresses <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three chains of laminin-2 at the epidermal/dermal junction, around hair follicles and in the sensory nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Skin biopsies can therefore be used to assess merosin status in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We show here an absence of laminin alpha 2 in skin from four cases of CMD with a severe phenotype and abnormal magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain, in contrast to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> expression in one case of mild CMD with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MRI, and in five controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An additional case of CMD had a partial deficiency of laminin alpha 2 in the skin and severe motor disability, but a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sensory nerves in this case showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> expression of laminin alpha 2, in contrast to its absence in the severe cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression of laminin beta 1 was also reduced in skin from cases of merosin-deficient CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast to human fetal muscle, the laminin alpha 2 protein was not detected in fetal skin up to 23 weeks of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The laminin beta 1 and gamma 1 chains, and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for laminin alpha 2, however, were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Studies of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of cultured skin cells suggest that fibroblasts are the major source of laminin alpha 2, not keratinocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our data show that skin is useful for the assessment of merosin status in patients with CMD and that skin fibroblasts may be a useful source of tissue-specific <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In addition, we show that there is a tissue-specific difference in the developmental expression of the laminin alpha 2 protein </plain></SENT>
