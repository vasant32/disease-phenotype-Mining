<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to relatively large surface defects, many minute defects less than several micrometers in size associated with protrusion of glial cytoplasm were observed in the cerebrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These findings were considered to represent early changes prior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The basement membrane adjacent to the defects showed amorphous, wavy, or whorled configurations, and gradually disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The glial cytoplasmic membrane seemed to be relatively well preserved in some areas where the basement membrane disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, both the basement membrane and cytoplasmic membrane became indistinct irregularly in areas without defects, including the spinal cord; similar lesions were found in the skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations confirm previous observations concerning defects of the pial-glial barrier of the brain surface, and may suggest the involvement of abnormal basement membrane or related structures, or both, in the genesis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> of FCMD </plain></SENT>
