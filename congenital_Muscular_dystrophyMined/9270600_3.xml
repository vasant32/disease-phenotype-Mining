<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a female infant with dystrophinopathy who was deficient in merosin in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient had a phenotype of typical CMD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter abnormalities</z:hpo> on brain MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Merosin was greatly reduced in the biopsied skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the expression of dystroglycan and syntrophin was also greatly reduced, and the immunoreactivity for the antibodies against the cysteine-rich/C-terminal domains of dystrophin was absent in the sarcolemma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis of the dystrophin gene revealed a complete lack of exons 71 through 74 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In skeletal muscle, only the mutant gene was expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the patient is a symptomatic Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> carrier with skewed X-inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This patient illustrates for the first time that a dystrophin abnormality can cause a secondary deficiency of merosin in dystrophinopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reduction of merosin may account for the clinical phenotype of CMD and correlate with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter abnormalities</z:hpo> in our patient </plain></SENT>
