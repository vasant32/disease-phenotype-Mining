<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We undertook in this study the first successful prenatal diagnoses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> and LGMD2C forms in Africa, with a subsequent postnatal clinical follow-up of the newborns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic and molecular studies were performed on cultured amniotic fluid cells after exclusion of maternal cell contamination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence on the patients' muscle biopsies was performed so as to study the expression of muscular laminins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results showed that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and affected fetuses were diagnosed according to the presence or the absence of the responsible mutation in LAMA2 or SGCG genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postnatal molecular and clinical outcome was concordant with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> prenatal diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> who was diagnosed as affected was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at birth, and developed later clinical features different from those observed in his severely affected elder brother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This intrafamilial clinical variability in two siblings occurring with the same mutation in LAMA2 gene emphasizes the importance of the postnatal follow-up in the confirmation of prenatal diagnosis, and suggests that other genetic or epigenetic factors can monitor the course of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> form </plain></SENT>
