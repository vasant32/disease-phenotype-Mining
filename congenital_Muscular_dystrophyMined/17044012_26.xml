<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Defects in glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan are associated with several forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, often characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003577'>congenital onset</z:hpo> and severe structural brain involvement, collectively known as dystroglycanopathies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six causative genes have been identified in these disorders including fukutin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in fukutin cause Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is the second most common form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> in Japan and is invariably associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> and structural brain defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the genetic defect in two white families with a dystroglycanopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The six genes responsible for dystroglycanopathies were studied in three children with a severe reduction of alpha-dystroglycan in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified pathogenic fukutin mutations in these two families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Affected children had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intelligence and brain structure and shared a <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (LGMD) phenotype, had marked elevation of serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase, and were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ambulant with remarkable steroid responsiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that fukutin mutations occur outside Japan and can be associated with much milder phenotypes than Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings significantly expand the spectrum of phenotypes associated with fukutin mutations to include this novel form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> that we propose to name LGMD2L </plain></SENT>
