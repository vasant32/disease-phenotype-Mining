<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutation of the LARGE gene is the rarest of the six known genetic causes of α-dystroglycanopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report further a family with MDC1D due to a complex genomic rearrangement that was not apparent on standard sequencing of LARGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two sisters in a consanguineous family had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002342'>moderate mental retardation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002438'>cerebellar malformations</z:hpo>, together with dystrophic changes and markedly reduced α-dystroglycan glycosylation staining on muscle biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was homozygous linkage to the LARGE locus but sequencing of LARGE coding regions was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of LARGE cDNA showed an abnormal sequence inserted between exons 10 and 11, in most of the transcripts, predicted to introduce a premature stop codon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The abnormal sequence mapped to a spliced EST (DA935254) of unknown function, normally located at 100 kb centromeric of LARGE on chromosome 22q12.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantitative PCR analysis of the EST and adjacent regions showed twice the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> copy number in patients' genomic DNA samples, consistent with a large intra-chromosomal duplication inserted into intron 10 of LARGE in a homozygous state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This insertion was associated with deletion of a central region of intron 10, but the exact break points of the deletion/duplication were not found, suggesting that an even more complex rearrangement may have occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The exact function of LARGE, a golgi protein, remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>POMT and POMGnT enzyme activities were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in patients' lymphoblast cells, suggesting that defects in LARGE do not affect the initiation of O-mannosyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
