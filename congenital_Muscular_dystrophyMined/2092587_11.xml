<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the children's cases, a complex columnar network of the molecular layer was mixed with clusters of the granular cell layers, often associated with central blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although primitive, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo> was also obvious in the fetal cerebellum at 23 weeks of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ectopic glial proliferation was less extensive than that in the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that leptomeningeal disruption, superficial proliferation of mesenchymal tissue and subsequent mixture of neuroglial and mesenchymal tissues, which may occur transiently during the fetal period in the developing FCMD cerebellum as well as in the cerebrum, play substantial roles in the development of cerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
