<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the extent and nature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0949664" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tauopathy</z:e> in the brains of 7 postfetal (14-34 years of age) and 2 fetal (18- and 20-week gestational age) FCMD cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> postfetal cases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0949664" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tauopathy</z:e> was found in the areas of cortical dysgenesis in the cerebrum, in addition to predictable sites such as the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In fetal cases, the neuropil of malformed cerebral cortex was diffusely immunostained with anti-aberrantly phosphorylated tau antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By immunoelectron microscopy, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> of the antibodies was associated with microtubule-like bundles within cellular processes protruding through disrupted glia limitans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Western blot analysis, a unique 50-kDa band of tau was detected in a fetal and a postfetal case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, 3 to 4 tau bands of 60 to 68 kD, similar to tau in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, were also detected in the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After dephosphorylation, the insoluble tau from the fetal and the postfetal cases showed highly similar immunoblotting patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This anomalous phosphorylation of tau may be related to the development of the cortical dysgenesis in FCMD and may shed light on the biologic function of tau in the development of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
