<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe a new entity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> caused by de novo LMNA mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen patients presenting with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in the first year of life were subjected to neurological and genetic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses were performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 15 patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> in the first year of life, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had de novo heterozygous LMNA mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of them had severe early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> disease, no motor development, and the rest experienced development of a "dropped head" syndrome phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite <z:hpo ids='HP_0003828'>variable severity</z:hpo>, there was a consistent clinical pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients typically presented with selective axial <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005150'>wasting</z:mp> of the cervicoaxial muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Limb involvement was predominantly proximal in upper extremities and distal in lower extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001883'>Talipes</z:hpo> feet and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003306'>rigid spine</z:hpo> with thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003307'>lordosis</z:hpo> developed early </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo> appeared later, most often in lower limbs, sparing the elbows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ten children required ventilatory support, three continuously through tracheotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> were observed in four of the oldest patients but were symptomatic only in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">Creatine</z:chebi> kinase levels were mild to moderately increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsies showed dystrophic changes in nine children and nonspecific <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathic changes</z:hpo> in the remaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Markedly atrophic fibers were common, most often type 1, and a few patients showed positive inflammatory markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: The LMNA mutations identified appear to correlate with a relatively severe phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our results further broaden the spectrum of laminopathies and define a new disease entity that we suggest is best classified as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (LMNA-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, or L-CMD) </plain></SENT>
