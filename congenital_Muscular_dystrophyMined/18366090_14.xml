<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the genes encoding collagen VI (COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3) cause Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (BM) and Ullrich <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (UCMD), two related conditions of differing severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BM is a relatively mild dominantly inherited disorder characterized by proximal <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>joint contractures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>UCMD was originally regarded as an exclusively <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> condition causing severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> with proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>joint contractures</z:hpo> and distal hyperlaxity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We and others have subsequently modified this model when we described UCMD patients with heterozygous in-frame deletions acting in a dominant-negative way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we report 10 unrelated patients with a UCMD clinical phenotype and de novo dominant negative heterozygous splice mutations in COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3 and contrast our findings with four UCMD patients with recessively acting splice mutations and two BM patients with heterozygous splice mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We find that the location of the skipped exon relative to the molecular structure of the collagen chain strongly correlates with the clinical phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis by immunohistochemical staining of muscle biopsies and dermal fibroblast cultures, as well as immunoprecipitation to study protein biosynthesis and assembly, suggests different mechanisms each for exon skipping mutations underlying dominant UCMD, dominant BM, and recessive UCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We provide further evidence that de novo dominant mutations in severe UCMD occur relatively frequently in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three collagen VI chains and offer biochemical insight into genotype-phenotype correlations within the collagen VI-related disorders by showing that severity of the phenotype depends on the ability of mutant chains to be incorporated in the multimeric structure of collagen VI </plain></SENT>
