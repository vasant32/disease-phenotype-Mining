<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in their genes are associated with a type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> called Walker-Warburg syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arg(64), Glu(78) and Arg(138) in the N-terminus region of ScPmt1p, a POMT homolog in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are important for transferase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arg(138) is also essential for complex formation with ScPmt2p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we examined the effects of replacing the corresponding residues in human POMT1 and POMT2 with Ala on complex formation and enzymatic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The human POMT1 mutants lost almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> transferase activity while the POMT2 mutants retained enzymatic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither mutant lost its ability to form complexes with the native counter component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that ScPmtps and human POMTs have different mechanisms of complex formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They also suggest that human POMT1 and POMT2 have discrete functions since the effect of amino acid substitutions on enzymatic activity are different </plain></SENT>
