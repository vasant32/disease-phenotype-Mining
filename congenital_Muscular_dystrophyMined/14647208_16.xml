<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pathogenic changes in the same gene were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> patients (MDC1C), a severe disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have screened 86 LGMD genealogies to assess the frequency and distribution of mutations in the FKRP gene in Brazilian LGMD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found 13 Brazilian genealogies, including 20 individuals with mutations in the FKRP gene, and identified nine novel pathogenic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The commonest C826A European mutation was found in 30% (9/26) of the mutated LGMD2I alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One affected patient homozygous for the FKRP (C826A) mutation also carries a missense R125H change in one allele of the caveolin-3 gene (responsible for LGMD1C <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of her <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sibs were found to be double heterozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two unrelated LGMD2I families, homozygous for novel missense mutations, we identified four asymptomatic carriers, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> older than 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Genotype-phenotype correlation studies in the present study as well as in patients from different populations suggests that the spectrum of variability associated with mutations in the FKRP gene seems to be wider than in other forms of LGMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It also reinforces the observations that pathogenic mutations are not always determinant of an abnormal phenotype, suggesting the possibility of other mechanisms modulating the severity of the phenotype that opens new avenues for therapeutic approaches </plain></SENT>
