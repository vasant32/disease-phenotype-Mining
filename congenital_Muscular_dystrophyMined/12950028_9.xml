<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study has examined the immunological localization of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-A, PDGF-B, and PDGF receptor (PDGFR) alpha and beta to clarify their role in the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Biopsied frozen muscles from patients with Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD), Becker <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (BMD), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) were analysed immunohistochemically using antibodies raised against PDGF-A, PDGF-B, and PDGFR alpha and beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Muscles from two dystrophic mouse models (dy and mdx mice) were also immunostained with antibodies raised against PDGFR alpha and beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human control muscle, neuromuscular junctions and vessels were positively stained with antibodies against PDGF-A, PDGF-B, PDGFR alpha and PDGFR beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In human <z:mp ids='MP_0000752'>dystrophic muscles</z:mp>, PDGF-A, PDGF-B, PDGFR alpha and PDGFR beta were strongly immunolocalized in regenerating muscle fibres and infiltrating macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PDGFR alpha was also immunolocalized to the muscle fibre sarcolemma and necrotic fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most significant finding in this study was a remarkable overexpression of PDGFR beta and, to a lesser extent, PDGFR alpha in the endomysium of DMD and CMD muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PDGFR was also overexpressed in the interstitium of muscles from dystrophic mice, particularly dy mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Double immunolabelling revealed that activated interstitial fibroblasts were clearly positive for PDGFR alpha and beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, DMD and CMD muscles with advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> showed very poor reactivity against PDGF and PDGFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Those findings were confirmed by immunoblotting with PDGFR beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that PDGF and its receptors are significantly involved in the active stage of tissue destruction and are associated with the initiation or promotion of muscle <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>They also have roles in muscle fibre regeneration and signalling at neuromuscular junctions in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and diseased muscle </plain></SENT>
