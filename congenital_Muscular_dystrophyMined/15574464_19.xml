<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the gene encoding fukutin-related protein (FKRP) cause a spectrum of diseases including <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> type 1C (MDC1C), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> 2I (LGMD2I) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> (CMDs) with brain malformations and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although these diseases are associated with abnormal dystroglycan processing, the cellular consequences of the idiosyncratic FKRP mutations have not been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show, in cultured cells, that FKRP mutants associated with the more severe disease phenotypes (S221R, A455D, P448L) are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> protein and the mutant L276I that causes LGMD2I are found predominantly in the Golgi apparatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ER-retained proteins have a shorter half-life than the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> FKRP and are preferentially degraded by the proteasome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, calnexin binds preferentially to the ER-retained mutants suggesting that it may participate in the quality control pathway for FKRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data provide the first evidence that the ER-retention of mutant FKRP may play a role in the pathogenesis of CMD and potentially explain why the allelic disorder LGMD2I is milder, because the mutated protein is able to reach the Golgi apparatus </plain></SENT>
