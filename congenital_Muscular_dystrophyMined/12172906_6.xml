<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In control cases, glial cells expressed fukutin and the expression continued from fetuses to adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Double immunostaining revealed that some of these cells were astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The glia limitans was stained by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, neuronal expression was decreased with neuronal maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The glia limitans formed by endfeet of astrocytes is abnormal in the brain of fetal to adult FCMD cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest an important role of astrocytes for the genesis of FCMD brain, although immature neurons expressed fukutin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In FCMD cases, expression of fukutin looked decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the brain of fetal FCMD cases, decreased expression of fukutin is considered to provoke the disruption of glia limitans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In post-natal FCMD cases, prominent superficial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> is observed in the cerebral surface, where fukutin was weakly positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reactive increase of astrocytes may be required to maintain the glia limitans for compensating the decrease of fukutin expression in individual astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the cerebellum, Bergmann glia, which did not express fukutin in control cases, elongated their cytoplasmic processes to the surface to form glia limitans even in the polymicrogyric area </plain></SENT>
