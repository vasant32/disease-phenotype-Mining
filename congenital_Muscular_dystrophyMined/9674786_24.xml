<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>Congenital muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> (CMD) are a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026848" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">muscle disorders</z:e> characterized by early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and a variable involvement of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Laminin alpha2 deficiency has been reported in about 40 to 50% of cases of the occidental, classic type of CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Laminin alpha2 is a muscle specific isoform of laminin localized to the basal lamina of muscle fibers, where it is thought to interact with myofiber membrane receptor, such as integrins, and possibly dystrophin-associated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-five CMD patients were tested for laminin alpha2 expression by immunofluorescence and immunoblot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The entire 10 kb laminin alpha2 coding sequence of 22 completely laminin alpha2-deficient patients was screened for causative mutations by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR/single strand conformational polymorphisms (SSCP) analysis and protein truncation test (PTT) analysis followed by automatic sequencing of patient cDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical data from the laminin alpha2-deficient patients were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty laminin alpha2-negative patients were identified (40% of CMD patients tested) and 22 of them were screened for laminin alpha2 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical features of laminin alpha2-deficient patients were similar, with severe floppiness at birth, delay in achievement of motor milestones, and MRI findings of white matter changes with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intelligence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Loss-of-function mutations were identified in 95% (21/22) of the patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SSCP analysis detected laminin alpha2 gene mutations in about 50% of the mutant chromosomes; PTT successfully identified 75% of the mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A two base pair deletion mutation at position 2,096-2,097 bp was present in 23% of the patients analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the large majority of laminin alpha2-deficient patients show laminin alpha2 gene mutations </plain></SENT>
