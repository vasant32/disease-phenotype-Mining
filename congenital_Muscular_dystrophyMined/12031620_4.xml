<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Congenital <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp>, markedly increased CK, calf pseudohypertrophy and proximal <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> were common early findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two cases were severely affected since infancy and never walked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The phenotypical homogeneity was not very evident until advanced stages of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients showed catastrophic progression of the <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002111'>restrictive respiratory insufficiency</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo>, peculiar extreme <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>amyotrophy</z:hpo> of hands and feet, and a round and 'puffy' face </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients became tetraplegic and required mechanical ventilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two cases had signs of mild cardiac involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The only non-tracheotomised patient died of respiratory complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> or specific brain abnormalities were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed secondary deficit of laminin 2 and up-regulation of laminin 5 in muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Expression of -dystroglycan was severely reduced in two available muscle samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The known loci for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> were excluded in the only consanguineous case by linkage analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinical, immunohistochemical and genetic findings strongly suggest a distinct entity </plain></SENT>
