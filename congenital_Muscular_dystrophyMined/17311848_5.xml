<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The dystrophin-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> complex spans the muscle plasma membrane and provides a mechanical linkage between laminin in the extracellular matrix and actin in the intracellular cytoskeleton </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Within the dystrophin-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> complex, the sarcoglycans and sarcospan constitute a subcomplex of transmembrane proteins that stabilize alpha-dystroglycan, a receptor for laminin and other components of the extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to elucidate the function of sarcospan, we generated transgenic mice that overexpress sarcospan in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sarcospan transgenic mice with moderate (tenfold) levels of sarcospan overexpression exhibit a severe phenotype that is similar to mouse models of laminin-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (MD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sarcospan transgenic mice display severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> and die prematurely between 6 and 10 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological analysis reveals that sarcospan expression causes muscle pathology marked by increased muscle fiber degeneration and/or regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sarcospan transgenic muscle does not display sarcolemma damage, which is distinct from dystrophin- and sarcoglycan-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We show that sarcospan clusters the sarcoglycans into insoluble protein aggregates and causes destabilization of alpha-dystroglycan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Evidence is provided to demonstrate abnormal extracellular matrix assembly, which represents a probable pathological mechanism for the severe and lethal dystrophic phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data suggest that sarcospan plays an important mechanical role in stabilizing the dystrophin-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> complex </plain></SENT>
