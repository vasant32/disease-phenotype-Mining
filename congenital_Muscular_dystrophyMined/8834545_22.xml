<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this area alone, the glia limitans that adjoined the abnormal mantle via one or two layers of basal lamina had frequent breaches, through which neuroglial elements extruded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the most severely affected cortical region, which had only a rudimentary and fragmentary glia limitans, the majority of cortical neurons had migrated into the neurogliomesenchymal tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The massive overmigrated neurons still maintained a somewhat columnar arrangement, and the marked <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> abruptly shifted to a neurogliomesenchymal tissue-free <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cortical structure with an intact glia limitans, thus indicating essentially vertical overmigration of neurons without significant tangential migration of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Together the above findings imply that breaches in the glia limitans may be the primary cause of the micropolygyria seen in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
