<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differences were observed between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and dy(2j)/dy(2j) mice from 3 to 12 weeks of age, and between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and dy/dy mice at 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In specific age ranges, the values of muscular transverse relaxation times in two dystrophic models are different from those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice, and could thus be used as an index of modifications in <z:mp ids='MP_0000752'>dystrophic muscle</z:mp> to evaluate therapies </plain></SENT>
