<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A point mutation in the gene coding for the laminin-2 alpha 2 chain leads to the expression of a truncated, partially functional protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We developed a simple assay for the detection of the dy2J allele, which contains a new NdeI restriction site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was prepared from animals of known status and amplified by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The digestion of the PCR product with the restriction enzyme resulted in characteristic profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then, this technique was used to identify heterozygous mice among unaffected animals of unknown status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the heterozygous genotype of these mice was confirmed by the birth of dystrophic offspring after mating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This technique allows the detection of the dy2J allele in heterozygous and homozygous animals at any age </plain></SENT>
