<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, bridging between genotype and phenotype through these resources currently requires manual effort or the development of customized software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we argue that integrating EG and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> provides a robust and flexible solution to this problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate how the Resource Description Framework (RDF) developed for the Semantic Web can be used to represent and integrate these resources and enable seamless access to them as a unified resource </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach by answering a real-world biomedical query linking a specific molecular function, glycosyltransferase, to the disorder <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
