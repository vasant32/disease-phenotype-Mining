<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate MRI findings in Brazilian patients with merosin-deficient CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients were evaluated using MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients presented with partial merosin deficiency and 22 with total merosin deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up examinations were done in 7 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T1- and T2-weighted images were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> examinations, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) was performed in 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Enhanced images were done in 11 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The WM involvement was classified according to location and severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 1991 to 2004, 32 MRI examinations were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Severe involvement was found in 23 patients in the frontal and temporal lobes, in 18 patients in the parietal lobes, and in 7 patients in the occipital lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The brain stem (n=5), cerebellum (n=6), internal capsules (n=1), and external capsules (n=5) were also affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient had occipital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001302'>pachygyria</z:hpo>, and one had cerebellar vermian <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Follow-up MRI showed no interval change (n=4), progression (n=1), or improvement of the findings (n=2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This series of patients demonstrated that there was no correlation between the extent of WM abnormality on MRI and the clinical status and degree of merosin deficiency (partial or total) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Bilateral WM involvement was seen to be more prominent in the parietal, frontal, and temporal regions of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The brain stem and internal and external capsules were less affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Cerebellar WM involvement is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Changes on follow-up imaging studies did not correlate with the clinical status of the patient </plain></SENT>
