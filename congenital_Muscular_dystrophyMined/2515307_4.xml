<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In muscle <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophies</z:mpath> as in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle-wasting</z:hpo> diseases and states, a progressive loss of muscle protein occurs, probably as a result of an imbalance between muscle protein synthesis and degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we examined whether this progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle wasting</z:hpo> and reduced functional capacity so damaging to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo>, can be reduced or even reversed by nightly overfeeding with 1000 ml of Osmolite in addition to the voluntary daytime dietary intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the Duchenne muscle <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> (DMD) group (six patients) body weight increased significantly accompanied by a 14% increase in midarm muscle circumference with only minimal changes in triceps skin fold, indicating a relative build up of muscle mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) group (four patients) no changes occurred in body weight or any of the three anthropometric measurements performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline nitrogen balance was mildly positive in both groups and improved significantly in the DMD group during the 3-month experimental period of refeeding, with no changes in urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27596">3-methylhistidine</z:chebi> excretion, suggesting improved muscle protein synthesis with no change in muscle protein degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No changes were detected in hematological and biochemical parameters, liver function tests, pulmonary function tests, or a general activity index during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that a reduced rate of protein synthesis rather than an increased rate of protein degradation occur in muscle <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophies</z:mpath>, and that overfeeding might offer promising nutritional effects, at least in DMD patients </plain></SENT>
