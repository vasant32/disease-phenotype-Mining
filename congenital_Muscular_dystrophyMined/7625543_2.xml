<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The measurements included the thickness of the genu, body and splenium; the length, height and five specific angles of the CC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cephalic index was also measured on axial MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The correlations among CC length, CC height, the five angles and the cephalic index were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One case of FCMD was found to have CC <z:mpath ids='MPATH_57'>agenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The thickness of the genu, body, splenium and CC length were significantly reduced in FCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, in FCMD, the CC height was increased, angle alpha was greater, angle delta reduced and the CC configuration more rounded, showing a high arch on imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant correlations among CC length, CC height, the five specific angles and the cephalic index were found in any of the FCMD data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These observations demonstrated the fact that CC development in FCMD is uniquely abnormal, and abnormal CC configuration does not have any correlation with altered cephalic index </plain></SENT>
