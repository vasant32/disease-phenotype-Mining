<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated pathologic distribution in white matter with heavily T(2)-weighted images using fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) pulse sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For detection of abnormal white matter lesions, FLAIR images were approximately twice as sensitive as T(2)-weighted images and five times as sensitive as T(1)-weighted images of spin echo sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the white matter lesions was disseminated and not correlated with cortical disarrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The distribution was not consistent with delayed myelination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings support the evidence found using in vitro proton-NMR spectroscopy that the pathologic origin of white matter lesions is dysmyelination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When conventional magnetic resonance imaging is used, masked white matter lesions are easy to misidentify as delayed myelination instead of disseminated developmental dysmyelination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lesions in the white matter of FCMD are masked because of brain development </plain></SENT>
