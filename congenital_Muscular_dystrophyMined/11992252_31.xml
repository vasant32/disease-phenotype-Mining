<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations of COL6A2 on chromosome 21q22 have recently been shown to cause UCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a genomewide screening with microsatellite markers in a consanguineous family with three sibs affected with UCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Linkage of the disease to chromosome 2q37 was found in this family and in two others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed COL6A3, which encodes the alpha3 chain of collagen VI, and identified one homozygous mutation per family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In family I, the three sibs carried an A--&gt;G transition in the splice-donor site of intron 29 (6930+5A--&gt;G), leading to the skipping of exon 29, a partial reduction of collagen VI in muscle biopsy, and an intermediate phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In family II, the patient had an unusual mild phenotype, despite a nonsense mutation, R465X, in exon 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the patient's COL6A3 transcripts showed the presence of various <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> species-one of which lacked several exons, including the exon containing the nonsense mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The deleted splice variant encodes collagen molecules that have a shorter N-terminal domain but that may assemble with other chains and retain a functional role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This could explain the mild phenotype of the patient who was still ambulant at age 18 years and who showed an unusual combination of hyperlaxity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100490'>finger contractures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In family III, the patient had a nonsense mutation, R2342X, causing absence of collagen VI in muscle and fibroblasts, and a severe phenotype, as has been described in patients with UCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mutations in COL6A3 are described in UCMD for the first time and illustrate the wide spectrum of phenotypes which can be caused by collagen VI deficiency </plain></SENT>
