<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These homozygous mice, designated dy3Kldy3K, are characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> and severe muscular dystrophic symptoms and die by 5 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Light microscopy revealed that muscle fiber degeneration in these mice begins no later than postnatal day 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In degenerating muscles, considerable amounts of TUNEL positive nuclei were detected as well as DNA laddering, suggesting increased apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was involved in the process of muscle fiber degeneration </plain></SENT>
