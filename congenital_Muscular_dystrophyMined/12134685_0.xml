<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their peak motor function varied from controlling the head incompletely to standing with support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, which in some cases was diagnosed with difficulty because of changing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> types and multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>joint contracture</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six patients underwent endotracheal intubation, and in 5 of them long-term mechanical ventilation began at the age of 15 to 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of them underwent trachestomy intermittent positive pressure ventilation (TIPPV), whereas recently 2 patients were treated successfully with nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mechanical in-exsufflation (MI-E) was effective in clearing airway secretion of 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With disease progression, the motor, mental, nutritional, cardiorespiratory and swallowing functions of FCMD patients should be assessed to ensure adequate management by NIPPV and MI-E </plain></SENT>
