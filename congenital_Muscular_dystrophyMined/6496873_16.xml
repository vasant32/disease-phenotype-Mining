<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consanguineous marriage of parents was found in 41 families (26.80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inbreeding coefficients in the patients was 10 times as high as that of the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both sexes were almost equally affected (M:F = 1.1:1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No single parent of the patients was affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recurrence among siblings was frequent (9 out of 41 siblings in offspring of related parents and 18 out of 110 siblings in offspring of unrelated parents were affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The segregation ratio was 23.91-27.08% in offspring of related parents, 20.00-22.94% in offspring of unrelated parents, these values being not significantly different from the 25% expected from the assumption of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>Sporadic</z:hpo> cases were not significantly more numerous than expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these data indicate that the disorder is caused by homozygosity of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Frequency of the gene was estimated to be 5.2-9.7 X 10(-3) and frequency of the patients 6.9-11.9 X 10(-5) </plain></SENT>
