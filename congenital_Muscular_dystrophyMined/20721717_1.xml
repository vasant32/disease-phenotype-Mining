<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>Congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD), among the myopathic disorders is one form of flaccid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular disorder</z:e> (NMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with NMD frequently develop progressive spinal deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For NMD patients who have a severe spinal deformity, sitting is often difficult and is accompanied by pain and breakdown of the skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spinal deformity surgery in these patients has been highly effective in stabilizing the spine, maintaining upright, comfortable sitting balance, and improving patients' quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, many studies have reported significant rates of peri/postoperative complications in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, there has been no study on the results of spinal deformity surgery in patients with CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to review the clinical and radiological results of spinal deformity surgery in this group of patients with CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 2004 and 2007, a total of 10 CMD patients underwent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were three patients with Fukuyama CMD, three with Ullrich CMD, and 4 with nonsyndromic CMD (merosin-negative) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They were nonambulatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients had standard posterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>spinal fusion</z:hpo> and pedicle-screw-alone fixation from T3 or T4 to L5 for spinal deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our inclusion criteria required that each patient (1) had considerable difficulty with sitting balance and pain or breakdown of the skin due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>; (2) was able to ventilate his or her lung autonomously; (3) was not ventilator-dependent; and (4) did not have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sufficient informed consent was important, and the decision to perform surgery was made by the patient/family with sufficient preoperative informed consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients were trained with inspiratory muscle training (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) using an inspiratory muscle trainer (Threshold <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) for 6 weeks prior to surgery Cardiac function was assessed preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary function tests were performed preoperatively and postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Radiographic assessments were performed on sitting anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These assessments were made periodically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The Cobb angles of the curves and spinal pelvic obliquity (SPO) on the coronal plane, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002942'>thoracic kyphosis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002938'>lumbar lordosis</z:hpo> were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The preoperative AP radiograph and side-bending films were examined to determine flexibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Patients' and parents' satisfaction were surveyed by a self-completed questionnaire at the last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Percent forced vital capacity (%FVC) increased from a mean of 30% before <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> to a mean of 34% the day before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> was 75 degrees (range 61 degrees -95 degrees ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The scoliotic curvature on preoperative side-bending films was 19 degrees (range 11 degrees -28 degrees ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were extubated on the day of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>No patients developed cardiac or respiratory complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The scoliotic curvature was 18 degrees (range 10 degrees -25 degrees ) immediately after surgery, and 19 degrees (range 12 degrees -27 degrees ) at the last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The pelvic obliquity improved from a mean of 17 degrees (range 14 degrees -20 degrees ) preoperatively to a mean of 6 degrees (range 4 degrees -9 degrees ) postoperatively and to 7 degrees (range 4 degrees -10 degrees ) at the last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Balanced sitting posture was achieved and maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>On the sagittal plane, good reconstruction of sagittal plane alignment was recreated and maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>There were no major complications or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients/parents completed the outcome satisfaction questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Eight patients/parents were very satisfied and two were satisfied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pedicle-screw-alone fixation and fusion to L5 was safe and effective in CMD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> of &lt;95 degrees and pelvic obliquity of &lt;20 degrees  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>Scoliosis</z:hpo> curves were flexible (75% correction) on side-bending films preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Curve correction and maintenance of correction in the coronal and sagittal plane was excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The pelvic obliquity significantly improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Balanced sitting posture was achieved and maintained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Our patients with CMD spinal deformity and a moderately and severely decreased FVC could be operated on safely and successfully with general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were extubated in the operating room </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>There were no major complications or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>We believe a FVC of &lt;30% alone is not a predisposition to pulmonary complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> might be a determining risk of mortality, and we believe surgery for these patients should be avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Patients' and parents' satisfaction was high </plain></SENT>
