<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a Lama2-deficient mouse model for this disease, animal survival is improved by muscle-specific expression of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> inhibitor Bcl-2, conferred by a MyoD-hBcl-2 transgene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we investigated early disease stages in this model to determine initial pathological events and effects of Bcl-2 on their progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using quantitative immunohistological and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> analyses we show that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> occurs very early in Lama2-deficient muscle, some aspects of which are reduced or delayed by the MyoD-hBcl-2 transgene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> for innate immune response regulators, including multiple Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the inflammasome component NLRP3, are elevated in diseased muscle compared with age-matched controls expressing Lama2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MyoD-hBcl-2 inhibits induction of TLR4, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 in Lama2-deficient muscle compared with non-transgenic controls, and leads to reduced infiltration of eosinophils, which are key <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> effector cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital disease</z:e> model provides a new paradigm for investigating cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> mechanisms during early stages of pathogenesis, demonstrating that interactions exist between Bcl-2, a multifunctional regulator of cell survival, and the innate immune response </plain></SENT>
