<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied 50 patients with the merosin-positive form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (MP-CMD) clinically and pathologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency of MP-CMD in our laboratory was approximately one-half that of the Fukuyama type and one-sixth that of Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The early signs of MP-CMD included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001558'>decreased fetal movement</z:hpo> during pregnancy (14%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002033'>poor suck</z:hpo> (42%), floppiness (30%), and respiratory difficulty (16%) in early infancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighty-six percent of the patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001270'>delayed motor development</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ninety-two percent of the patients followed beyond age 4 years had learned to walk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The disease was relatively <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo>, except in six patients who rapidly lost ambulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> IQ, except four who were mildly to moderately retarded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the patients examined by cranial CT/MRI, 24% showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> and 11% had areas of white matter lucency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsy results in those younger than 5 years showed mild dystrophic changes consisting of variation in fiber size and scattered necrotic and regenerating fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In older children, there were additional <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dystrophic changes, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0003555'>fiber splitting</z:hpo> (32%), moth-eaten appearance (32%), marked fatty replacement (46%), and abnormal fiber type distribution (59%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The manifestations of MP-CMD were generally milder and more <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo> than those of the Fukuyama type and merosin-negative form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
