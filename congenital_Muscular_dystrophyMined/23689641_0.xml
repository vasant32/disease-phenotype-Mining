<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, few MEB cases have been reported in China where clinical recognition and genetic confirmatory testing on a research basis are recent developments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the clinical and molecular genetics of three MEB disease patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients had different degrees of muscle, eye and brain symptoms, ranging from congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0008947'>hypotonia, early</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011003'>severe myopia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> to mild <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, independent walking and language problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This confirmed the expanding phenotypic spectrum of MEB disease with varying degrees of <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002350'>cerebellar cysts</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> and characteristic brainstem flattening and kinking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four candidate genes (POMGnT1, FKRP, FKTN and POMT2) were screened, and six POMGnT1 mutations (four novel) were identified, including five missense and one splice site mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pathogenicity of the two novel variants in one patient was confirmed by POMGnT1 enzyme activity assay, protein expression and subcellular localization of mutant POMGnT1 in HeLa cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transfected cells harboring this patient's L440R mutant POMGnT1 showed POMGnT1 mislocalization to both the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We have provided clinical, histological, enzymatic and genetic evidence of POMGnT1 involvement in three unrelated MEB disease patients in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The identification of novel POMGnT1 mutations and an expanded phenotypic spectrum contributes to an improved understanding of POMGnT1 structure-function relationships, CMD pathophysiology and genotype-phenotype correlations, while underscoring the need to consider POMGnT1 in Chinese MEB disease patients </plain></SENT>
