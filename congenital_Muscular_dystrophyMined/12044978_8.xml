<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While the presumed roles of complement and macrophages have been those of scavenger to remove and clear necrotic fibers, there is some evidence that they play a primary role in the pathogenesis of these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we explore the role of complement in the pathogenesis of the most severe animal model of congenital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath>, the dy-/- mouse, which is laminin alpha2-deficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We generated animals deficient in both C3 and laminin alpha2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>C3 is the third component of the complement cascade and is required for activation of either the classical or alternative pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three percent of the dy-/-:C3+ mice (n=59) died before 24 weeks while only 14% of the dy-/-:C3-/- (n=29) mice died (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Absolute forepaw strength was 25-30% greater for the dy-/-:C3-/- mice up to 20 weeks of age (p&lt;0.05 compared to complement-sufficient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forepaw strength adjusted for weight also showed significant differences with C3-/- mice being stronger up to 20 weeks (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, by 24 weeks, the two groups did not differ for strength </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Next, we treated 20 mice with twice weekly oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Survival at 24 weeks for the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> treated dy-/- mice (C3-/- or C3+) was 90% (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This work shows that complement insufficiency and weekly <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> prolong survival and improve strength of the laminin alpha2-deficient mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This work suggests that the complement system may contribute directly to the pathogenesis of this form of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Because complement activity may be modified pharmacologically, this work may have implications for treatment of children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> secondary to laminin alpha2 deficiency </plain></SENT>
