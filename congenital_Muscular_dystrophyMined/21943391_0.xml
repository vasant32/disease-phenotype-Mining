<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ColVI <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> also share common features with other disorders associated with prominent muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo>, making differential diagnosis difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This group of disorders, under-recognized for a long time, has aroused much interest over the past decade, with important advances made in understanding its molecular pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indeed, numerous mutations have now been reported in the COL6A1, COL6A2 and COL6A3 genes, a large proportion of which are de novo and exert dominant-negative effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotype-phenotype correlations have also started to emerge, which reflect the various pathogenic mechanisms at play in these disorders: dominant de novo exon splicing that enables the synthesis and secretion of mutant tetramers and homozygous nonsense mutations that lead to premature termination of translation and complete loss of function are associated with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, severe phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this review, we present the current state of diagnosis and research in the field of ColVI <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The past decade has provided significant advances, with the identification of altered cellular functions in animal models of ColVI <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> and in patient samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction and a defect in the autophagic clearance system of skeletal muscle have recently been reported, thereby opening potential therapeutic avenues </plain></SENT>
