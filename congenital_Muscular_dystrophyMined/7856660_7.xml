<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007260'>type II lissencephaly</z:hpo> and ocular anomalies is found in Fukuyama CMD (FCMD), the Walker-Warburg syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e>), and muscle-eye-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> (MEBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The classification of these disorders remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between 1972 and 1992, we performed clinical and genetic studies in 41 families of FCMD, which is particularly frequent in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine families (22%) had multiple affected children ("familial" FCMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other 32 families had only one affected child ("<z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo>" FCMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Parental consanguinity was documented in 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> FCMD families and in none of the familial cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In total, 48 patients, including 7 sib pairs, were evaluated with regard to maximum motor ability, mental and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036572,C0009951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Sign or Symptom" abbrv="">convulsion</z:e> states, cranial CT or MRI findings, and EEG and ophthalmological data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A difference between the sibs in motor ability was apparent in 4 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mental status also showed wide variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two of 7 sib pairs differed in EEG findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The familial FCMD patients showed relatively more severe motor disability than that in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> FCMD patients, while in mental and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036572,C0009951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Sign or Symptom" abbrv="">convulsion</z:e> states no significant difference was found in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in one family <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> was found in only one of the sibs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, this patient showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002084'>encephalocele</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> at birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Based on these observations, we consider the clinical spectrum of FCMD to be much broader than previously described and to overlap with that of "mild" <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> and MEBD </plain></SENT>
