<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The laminin alpha2 chain is a major component of basal lamina in both skeletal muscle and the peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Laminin alpha2 chain deficiency causes merosin-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, which affects not only skeletal muscles, but also the peripheral and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that the formation of basal lamina is required for myelination in the peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In fact, the spinal root of dystrophic mice (dy/dy mice), whose laminin alpha2 chain expression is greatly reduced, shows lack of basal lamina and clusters of naked axons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of laminin alpha2 chain and basal lamina in vivo, we examined the peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system of dy3K/dy3K mice, which are null mutants of laminin alpha2 chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicate the presence of myelination although Schwann cells lacked basal lamina in the spinal roots of dy3K/dy3K mice, suggesting that basal lamina is not an absolute requirement for myelination in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, the expression of laminin alpha4 chain was increased and laminin alpha5 chain was preserved in the endoneurium of the spinal root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Laminin alpha4 and alpha5 chains may play the critical role in myelination instead of laminin alpha2 chain in dy3K/dy3K mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the motor conduction velocity of the sciatic nerve was significantly reduced compared with that of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This reduction in conduction velocity may be due to small axon diameter, thin myelin sheath and the patchy disruption of the basal lamina of the nodes of Ranvier in dy3K/dy3K mice </plain></SENT>
