<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Through positional cloning, we previously identified the gene for FCMD, which encodes the fukutin protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report that chimeric mice generated using embryonic stem cells targeted for both fukutin alleles develop severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, with the selective deficiency of alpha-dystroglycan and its laminin-binding activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, these mice showed laminar disorganization of the cortical structures in the brain with impaired laminin assembly, focal interhemispheric fusion, and hippocampal and cerebellar dysgenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, chimeric mice showed anomaly of the lens, loss of laminar structure in the retina, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that fukutin is necessary for the maintenance of muscle integrity, cortical histiogenesis, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ocular development and suggest the functional linkage between fukutin and alpha-dystroglycan </plain></SENT>
