<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one FCMD families, 13 of them with consanguineous marriages, were analysed by genetic linkage analyses with polymorphic microsatellite markers to map the FCMD gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significant lod scores were obtained with the markers D9S58 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2955">Zmax</z:chebi> = 5.81 at theta = 0.06), D9S59 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2955">Zmax</z:chebi> = 4.33 at theta = 0.02), and HXB (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2955">Zmax</z:chebi> = 3.28 at theta = 0.09) on chromosome 9q31-33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multipoint analysis placed FCMD between D9S58 and D9S59, with a maximum lod score of 16.93 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These markers will be useful for presymptomatic, prenatal and carrier diagnosis of family members carrying FCMD, and they represent important resources for the identification of a gene responsible for FCMD </plain></SENT>
