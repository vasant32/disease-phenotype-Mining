<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of the muscular renin-angiotensin system (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, we used immunohistochemistry and Western blotting to examine the cellular localization of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> type 1 receptor (AT1) and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> type 2 receptor (AT2) in muscle biopsies from patients with Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD), Becker <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (BMD), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> muscle, ACE was expressed in vascular endothelial cells and neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), whereas AT1 was immunolocalized to the smooth muscle cells of blood vessels and intramuscular nerve twigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AT2 was immunolocalized in the smooth muscle cells of blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> has a functional role in peripheral nerves and NMJs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ACE and AT1, but AT2 immunoreactivity were increased markedly in <z:mp ids='MP_0000752'>dystrophic muscle</z:mp> as compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ACE and the AT1 were strongly expressed in the cytoplasm and nuclei of regenerating muscle fibers, fibroblasts, and in macrophages infiltrating necrotic fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Double immunolabeling revealed that activated fibroblasts in the endomysium and perimysium of DMD and CMD muscle were positive for ACE and AT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Triple immunolabeling demonstrated that transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and ACE were colocalized on the cytoplasm of activated fibroblasts in <z:mp ids='MP_0000752'>dystrophic muscle</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Western blotting showed increases in the expression of AT1 and TGF-beta1 protein in <z:mp ids='MP_0000752'>dystrophic muscle</z:mp>, which coincided with our immunohistochemical results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overexpression of ACE and AT1 in <z:mp ids='MP_0000752'>dystrophic muscle</z:mp> would likely result in the increased production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi>, which may act on these cells in an autocrine manner via AT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The activation of AT1 may induce fibrous tissue formation through overexpression of TGF-beta1, which potently activates fibrogenesis and suppresses regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results imply that the intramuscular <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>-TGF-beta1 pathway is activated in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and plays a role at least partly in the pathophysiology of this disease </plain></SENT>
