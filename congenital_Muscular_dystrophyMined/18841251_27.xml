<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prior analyses of expressed sequence tags show that almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Alu-derived exons are alternatively spliced, and the vast majority of these exons have low transcript inclusion levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this work, we provide genomic and experimental evidence for diverse splicing patterns of exonized Alu elements in human tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using Exon array data of 330 Alu-derived exons in 11 human tissues and detailed RT-PCR analyses of 38 exons, we show that some Alu-derived exons are constitutively spliced in a broad range of human tissues, and some display strong tissue-specific switch in their transcript inclusion levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most of such exons are derived from ancient Alu elements in the genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In SEPN1, mutations of which are linked to a form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, the muscle-specific inclusion of an Alu-derived exon may be important for regulating SEPN1 activity in muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Realtime qPCR analysis of this SEPN1 exon in macaque and chimpanzee tissues indicates human-specific increase in its transcript inclusion level and muscle specificity after the divergence of humans and chimpanzees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results imply that some Alu exonization events may have acquired adaptive benefits during the evolution of primate transcriptomes </plain></SENT>
