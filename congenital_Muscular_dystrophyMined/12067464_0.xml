<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In four years (1997-2000), we found three patients with merosin-deficient CMD, one of them having an unusual clinical and pathological manifestation of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsies of gastrocnemius or quadriceps muscles were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition with the conventional HE staining, indirect immunohistochemistry for merosin, dystrophin, utrophin and for the proteins of the dystrophin associated complex (alpha-, beta-, gamma- sarcoglycans; beta-dystroglycan) was performed on cryosections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that there is no correlation between the clinical and histological picture of the disease and the expression of merosin in skeletal muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of muscle involvment (assessed by histology) is parallel with the clinical neuromotor deficiency, but not with expression of merosin, which can be absent even in mild cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical investigations as well as current morphological techniques, only together with immunohistochemistry can differentiate between merosin - deficient CMD and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> forms </plain></SENT>
