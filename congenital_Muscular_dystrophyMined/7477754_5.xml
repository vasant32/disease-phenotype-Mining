<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess fine motor and perceptuo-motor abilities in children with CMD with and without MRI changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two children with "pure" CMD were investigated with a standard neurological examination and a battery of tests (Manual dexterity from the Movement ABC, test of visual-motor integration, Zurich Neuromotor test) which have already been used to detect minor neurological signs related to white matter changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cohort was then divided in two groups for analysis depending on the presence or the absence of diffuse white matter changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant difference was found for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the tests between the group of the CMD children with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MRI and the group with diffuse white matter changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The manual dexterity and the Zurich Neuromotor tests showed a greater sensitivity than the test of visual-motor integration, which had some false negatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is of interest that in the group with diffuse white matter changes the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> did not seem to affect the quality of the performance; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these children scored abnormally on the test, irrespective of the severity or the extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in children with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MRI severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> did affect the performances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that perceptuo-motor difficulties and minor neurological soft signs are a consistent feature in CMD children with diffuse MRI changes but not with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MRI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
