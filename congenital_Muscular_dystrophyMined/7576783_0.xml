<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Low density areas (LDs) in the cerebral white matter on cranial CT were present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 patients younger than 13 years of age and in 1 of 3 adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LDs corresponded to low signals on T1 weighted MRI image and high signals on T2 weighted MRI image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The follow-up MRI showed a decreased tendency of the abnormal signals in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Short somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) in two infants, aged 4 months and 8 months, showed absent or depressed N1 amplitudes and delayed interpeak latencies from P3 to N1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>N1 amplitudes increased on follow-up studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SSEPs of five patients, who were older than 2 years of age, showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> N1-P3 latencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Amplitude of N1 was low in 2 patients with LD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since the absent or depressed amplitude and delayed latency of N1 improved with the decrease of abnormal signals on MRI, we considered that N1 abnormalities show delayed myelination </plain></SENT>
