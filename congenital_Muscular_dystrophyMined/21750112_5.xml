<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No mitochondria were found in the center of muscle fibers, while those located at the periphery of the fibers were significantly enlarged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Muscle mitochondria in rmd mice exhibited significantly decreased PC levels, impaired respiratory chain enzyme activities, decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ATP synthesis, decreased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23354">coenzyme</z:chebi> Q and increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Molecular markers of mitophagy, including Parkin, PINK1, LC3, polyubiquitin and p62, were localized to mitochondria of rmd muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Quantitative analysis shows that the number of mitochondria in muscle fibers and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA copy number were decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that the genetic defect in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> kinase in muscle results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction and subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> loss through enhanced activation of mitophagy </plain></SENT>
