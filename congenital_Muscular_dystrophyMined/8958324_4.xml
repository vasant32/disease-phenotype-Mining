<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The identification of the FCMD gene locus at 9q31 opened the theoretical possibility of prenatal diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors conducted prenatal diagnosis in two unrelated FCMD families by analysis using nine microsatellite CA-repeat polymorphic markers flanking the FCMD locus, and calculated phenotype probabilities in fetuses with a computer program, LINKAGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fetus in family 1 showed a 99% probability of being healthy either as a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> homozygote or a heterozygote carrier and was born without signs of FCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In family 2, the fetus was diagnosed to have FCMD with at least 86% probability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The parents of this family decided to terminate the pregnancy and an abortus showed brain malformations characteristic of an FCMD fetus </plain></SENT>
