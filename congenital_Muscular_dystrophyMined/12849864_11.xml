<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Mutations disrupting the interaction of extra-cellular ligands and alpha-dystroglycan are responsible for an etiologically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> (CMD) that can have associated brain and eye abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective is to develop a diagnostic test for one of these CMDs, Muscle-Eye-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain disease</z:e> (MEB), due to mutations in the gene encoding Protein O-Mannosyl beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (POMGnT1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: POMGnT1 enzyme activity was determined in extracts of muscle biopsies from four MEB patients and various controls using commercially available reagents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four MEB muscle samples showed a highly significant decrease in POMGnT1 activity relative to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The assay of POMGnT1 activity in MEB muscle provides a rapid and relatively simple diagnostic test for this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CMDs associated with brain malformations such as MEB, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> and FCMD are heterogenous in clinical presentation and on radiologic examination, suggesting that POMGnT1 assays of muscle biopsies should be used as a screening procedure for MEB in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CMD patients associated with brain malformations </plain></SENT>
