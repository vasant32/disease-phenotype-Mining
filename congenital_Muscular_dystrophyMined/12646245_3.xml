<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dystrophic DG(S654A) muscles have reduced binding of antibodies, including VIA4-1, that recognize carbohydrate antigens on alpha dystroglycan, a finding similar to muscles in some forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we describe one DG(S654A) transgenic line where VIA4-1 antibody binding is absent in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In theory, the absence of this carbohydrate antigen should inhibit later glycosylation events that would occur on the structure or structures this antibody binds to </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One such modification is likely to be the CT carbohydrate antigen, which is present on alpha dystroglycan in muscles overexpressing the CT GalNAc transferase [Dev </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To test the relationship between the VIA4-1 and CT carbohydrate antigens, we made DG(S654A)/CT GalNAc transferase (DG(S654A)/CT) transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, dystroglycan was cleaved, and alpha dystroglycan was glycosylated with the VIA4-1 antigen, in DG(S654A)/CT muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, muscles in DG(S654A)/CT transgenic mice had little or no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> when compared to DG(S654A) littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These experiments demonstrate that the CT GalNAc transferase can affect the post-translational processing of dystroglycan and the extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> even in muscles where the VIA4-1 antigen is not present </plain></SENT>
