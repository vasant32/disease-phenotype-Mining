<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Splicing mutations occurring outside the invariant GT and AG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> are frequent in disease genes and the definition of their pathogenic potential is often challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have identified four patients affected by Ullrich <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and carrying unusual mutations of COL6 genes affecting <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In three cases the mutations occurred in the COL6A2 gene and consisted of nucleotide substitutions within the degenerated sequences flanking the canonical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the fourth case, a genomic deletion occurred which removed the exon8-intron8 junction of the COL6A1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These mutations induced variable splicing phenotypes, consisting of exon skipping, intron retention and cryptic splice site activation/usage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A quantitative <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> assay revealed a reduced level of transcription of the mutated in-frame <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> originating from a COL6A2 point mutation at intronic position +3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At variance, the transcription level of the mutated in-frame <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> originating from a genomic deletion which removed the splicing sequences of COL6A1 exon 8 was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a different transcriptional efficiency of a regulatory splicing mutation compared to a genomic deletion causing a splicing defect </plain></SENT>
