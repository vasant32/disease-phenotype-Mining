<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Autopsy of the first case revealed the major pathological changes of FCMD, i.e. micropolygyria, loss of cytoarchitecture, <z:hpo ids='HP_0007348'>hypoplasia of the pyramidal tract</z:hpo>, leptomeningeal thickening </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is the first case in which brain tissue has been investigated on two separate occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the biopsy specimen--at the age of 14 months--myelination was poor and <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> marked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At autopsy--4 years later--myelination proved to be only slightly less than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
