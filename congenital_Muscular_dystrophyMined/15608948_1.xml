<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The classical form of the disease manifests as more or less severe <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003324'>generalized weakness</z:hpo> with predominance in axial and proximal limb muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical variants also exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Usually MmD is inherited as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> trait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> is recognized and up to now mutations in the genes of RYR1 and SEPN1 have been detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We record three unrelated cases of MmD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Case 1, with the classical benign form, was followed-up for 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Case 2, presenting pharyngolaryngeal involvement and severe delay of head control, improved gradually, until independent gait was acquired at age of six years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A moderate restriction of daily life activities remains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Case 3, of antenatal-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, was expressed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002804'>arthrogryposis</z:hpo> of hands, predominance of scapular girdle deficit and a stable course after ten years on physiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were selected by the characteristic morphological abnormalities in biceps brachii samples, including electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Emphasis is given to case 2 due to type 1 fiber uniformity and mild endomysial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, posing a difficult differential diagnosis with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> were it not for the significant number of multi-minicores </plain></SENT>
