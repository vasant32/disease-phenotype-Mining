<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serial Sanger sequencing of suspected CMD genes, while the current molecular diagnostic method of choice, can be slow and expensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive panel test for simultaneous screening of mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known CMD-associated genes would be a more effective diagnostic strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, the CMDs are a model disorder group for development and validation of next-generation sequencing (NGS) strategies for diagnostic and clinical care applications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a highly multiplexed PCR-based target enrichment method (RainDance) in conjunction with NGS, we performed mutation detection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CMD genes of 26 samples and compared the results with Sanger sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The RainDance NGS panel showed great consistency in coverage depth, on-target efficiency, versatility of mutation detection, and genotype concordance with Sanger sequencing, demonstrating the test's appropriateness for clinical use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to single tests, a higher diagnostic yield was observed by panel implementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The panel's limitation is the amplification failure of select gene-specific exons which require Sanger sequencing for test completion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Successful validation and application of the CMD NGS panel to improve the diagnostic yield in a clinical laboratory was shown </plain></SENT>
