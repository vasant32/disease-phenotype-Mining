<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fukutin, a gene responsible for Fukuyama type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD), is presumably related to the glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG), involved in basement membrane formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hypoglycosylation of alpha-DG plays a key role for the pathogenesis of FCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, fukutin and alpha-DG are also expressed in various non-neuromuscular tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, a role of alpha-DG as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> suppressor has been proposed, because of a decrease of glycosylated alpha-DG in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, function of fukutin was investigated in two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines, focusing on whether fukutin is involved in the glycosylation of alpha-DG in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells and has any possible roles related to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> suppressor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Localization of fukutin and a result of laminin-binding assay after <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference suggest that fukutin may be involved in the glycosylation of alpha-DG in a small portion in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Western blotting and immuno-electron microscopy, localization of fukutin in the nucleus was suggested in addition to the Golgi apparatus and/or endoplasmic reticulum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, there were more Ki-67-positive cells and more nuclear staining of phosphorylated c-jun after knockdown of fukutin in two cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fukutin appears to suppress cell proliferation through a system involving c-jun, although it is unclear this process is related to alpha-DG or not at present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The result may propose a possibility of another function of fukutin in addition to the glycosylation of alpha-DG in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
