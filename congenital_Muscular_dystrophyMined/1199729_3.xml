<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first case was that of an 11-year-old boy and the other of a 22-year-old male adult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both cases had similar clinical features, very early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of disease, diffuse and extensive <z:mp ids='MP_0005150'>wasting</z:mp> of skeletal muscles including facial muscles, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contracture</z:hpo> of joints, <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the familial histories of these two cases, the parents of the boy were consanguineous, and a sister of the adult case suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both of these two cases were clinically diagnosed as congenital cerebromuscular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> (Fukuyama's type) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Autopsy revealed marked <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> of generalized skeletal muscles and widespread micropolygyria of the brain in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spinal cords and peripheral nerves were free from any prominent changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that so-called congenital cerebromuscular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> may be caused by myogenic as well as neurogenic abnormalities during fetal period </plain></SENT>
