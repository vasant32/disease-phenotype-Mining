<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Laminin 2 is a major component of the basal lamina of skeletal muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is a heterotrimer composed of 3 chains: merosin (laminin alpha 2 chain), beta 1, and gamma 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Deficiency of merosin, with or without laminin beta 1 chain reduction, is associated with some forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Deficient expression of laminin beta 1 chain is also associated with some cases of merosin-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of laminin 2 subunits has not been well studied in the skeletal muscle of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (LGMD), nor has much attention been given to the significance of reduction of individual laminin 2 subunits, such as beta 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To examine the expression of laminin 2 subunits in skeletal muscle in patients with LGMD and to define the clinical features of patients with LGMD who have abnormal expression of laminin 2 subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied muscle biopsy specimens from 18 patients with LGMD using immunofluorescence with antibodies against dystrophin C-terminus, beta-dystroglycan, alpha-sarcoglycan, gamma-sarcoglycan, and the laminin subunits merosin, beta 1, and gamma 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 18 biopsy specimens, 9 were available for electron microscopic examination of the muscle basement membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical features associated with abnormal laminin beta 1 chain immunoreactivity were further described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Laminin beta 1 chain was either barely detectable or severely reduced in 3 cases of patients with LGMD in which the biopsy specimens showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> staining with the other antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 cases had common clinical features consistent with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> LGMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Specimens from 2 of the 3 cases that were available for ultrastructural examination showed significant abnormalities of the muscle fiber basement membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal expression of laminin beta 1 chain without concomitant deficiency of alpha-sarcoglycan in skeletal muscle has not been previously described in LGMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Reduced laminin beta 1 chain immunoreactivity may potentially serve as a marker for defining subsets of individuals with LGMD, in particular those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> pelvifemoral presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The abnormality of muscle fiber basement membranes in specimens from cases that were available for ultrastructural study suggests that defects in the extracellular matrix may play a role in the pathogenesis of this subset of LGMD </plain></SENT>
