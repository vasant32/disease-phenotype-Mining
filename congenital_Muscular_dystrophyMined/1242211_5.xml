<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients with a presumptive diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> were followed for up to 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was based on clinical, enzyme, histological and neurophysiological examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The group formed nine per cent of the 160 children suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852419,C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular disorders</z:e> seen at the same hospital during a period of ten years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> was generalized and also involved respiratory muscles and the face </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>60 per cent of the children had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002803'>congenital contractures</z:hpo>; these were well amenable to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there was a strong tendency for new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo> to form from the second to third year onwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were also other signs indicating that the disease process was changing with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The deep tendon reflexes were present in the beginning but later were usually lost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase was raised even to high levels in the first one to two years and gradually sank to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The histopathological findings changed with time from relatively slight changes compatible with a muscle destroying process to inactive type lesions characterized by fibrotic and particularly adipose tissue replacing muscle fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these findings it can be assumed that the active disease process is at its height during intrauterine and early postnatal life and then wanes leaving an outburnt or cicatrical state in which new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo> easily develop causing possible deterioration with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Active treatment is thus of great importance both to overcome neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo> and to prevent new ones to develop </plain></SENT>
