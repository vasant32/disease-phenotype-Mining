<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Biglycan is an extracellular ligand for the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) that is upregulated in both dystrophic and regenerating muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Biglycan also binds to collagen VI, mutations of which cause a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (Ullrich's; UCMD) that is also characterized by connective tissue abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of biglycan in early development and postnatal ages has not been well characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we show that biglycan transcript levels peak at approximately 21 weeks' gestation in human fetal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemical analysis of developing mouse muscle shows that biglycan can be detected in muscle as early as embryonic day (E)16 and is most abundant between postnatal day (P)1 and P7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biglycan is also highly expressed in developing tendon, with maximal levels observed at E16-18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This robust tendon expression is correlated with a sharp peak in biglycan transcript levels in the hindlimb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, at E18 collagen VI colocalizes with biglycan in tendon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that biglycan has a particularly important function during muscle and connective tissue development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, biglycan may play a role in the pathogenesis of collagen VI-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
