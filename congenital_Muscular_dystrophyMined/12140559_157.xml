<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations reported in genes of FCMD and MEB patients suggest that the genes may be involved in protein glycosylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dystroglycan is a highly glycosylated component of the muscle dystrophin-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> complex that is also expressed in brain, where its function is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we show that brain-selective deletion of dystroglycan in mice is sufficient to cause CMD-like brain malformations, including disarray of cerebral cortical layering, fusion of cerebral hemispheres and cerebellar folia, and aberrant migration of granule cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dystroglycan-null brain loses its high-affinity binding to the extracellular matrix protein laminin, and shows discontinuities in the pial surface basal lamina (glia limitans) that probably underlie the neuronal migration errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, mutant mice have severely blunted hippocampal long-term potentiation with electrophysiologic characterization indicating that dystroglycan might have a postsynaptic role in learning and memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data strongly support the hypothesis that defects in dystroglycan are central to the pathogenesis of structural and functional brain abnormalities seen in CMD </plain></SENT>
