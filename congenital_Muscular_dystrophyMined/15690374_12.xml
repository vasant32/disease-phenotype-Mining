<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis is supported by abnormal immunoreactivity for collagen VI on muscle biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As patients with UCMD show clinical characteristics typical of classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disorders of connective tissue</z:e> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndromes</z:e> (EDS), we investigated the ultrastructure of skin biopsy samples from patients with UCMD (n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy of skin biopsies revealed ultrastructural abnormalities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, including alterations of collagen fibril <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> (variation in size and composite fibers) and increase in ground substance, which resemble those seen in patients with EDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that there is a true connective tissue component as part of the phenotypic spectrum of UCMD and that there is considerable clinical as well as morphological overlap between UCMD and classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
