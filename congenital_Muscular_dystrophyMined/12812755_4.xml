<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has recently been demonstrated that MCSP/NG2 expression is not restricted to mitotic or malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show that MCSP/NG2 expression is detectable in the sarcolemma, and in the neuromuscular junction of human postnatal skeletal muscle, and it gradually reduces with advancing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In human and murine myogenic cell lines, we found no clear differences in MCSP/NG2 expression between myoblasts and myotubes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reduced levels of the core protein were found in merosin-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> patients muscles exhibited an overexpression of the MCSP/NG2 core protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In gamma-sarcoglycanopathy and calpainopathy, MCSP/NG2 upregulation was restricted to regenerating myofibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that MCSP/NG2 is expressed in differentiated myofibers, and appears to have a role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> and severe dystrophinopathies </plain></SENT>
