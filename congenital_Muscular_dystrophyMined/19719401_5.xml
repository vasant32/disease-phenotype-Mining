<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Effective clinical interventions for those diseases are very limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gene therapy represents a novel therapeutic strategy for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031117" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">PNS diseases</z:e>, especially with simply and minimally invasive delivery methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previously, we have shown that adeno-associated virus type 8 (AAV8) can efficiently transduce muscles body wide by a simple intraperitoneal injection in neonatal mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the capacity of AAV8 in transducing PNS in neonatal mice by intraperitoneal injection and also in adult mice by intramuscular injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Efficient and long-term gene transfer was found in the white matter of the spinal cord, DRG neurons, and peripheral nerves in both groups, treated either as neonates or as adults, particularly neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the adult mice injected with AAV8 in tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles in one of the hind legs, more neurons were transduced in the lower part of the spinal cord than in the upper part; the DRG neurons were transduced more on the vector-injected side than in the contralateral uninjected side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Few cells in the gray matter of the spinal cord were transduced regardless of the delivery methods and age of the mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results support the mechanism of vector retrograde transport and suggest that AAV8 crosses blood-nerve barrier poorly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our finding should have important implications in gene therapy for peripheral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
