<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, six different genes are known to be implicated in these diseases: POMT1, POMT2, POMGNT1, FCMD, FKRP, and LARGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the molecular characterization of a patient presenting clinical features of CMD and reduced immunostaining for alfa-dystroglycan in muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three candidate genes (FCMD, POMT1 and POMGNT1) were analyzed, and a total of 18 sequence variants were detected: 15 polymorphisms in POMT1 [including three unreported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)], two polymorphisms in FCMD, and the exonic silent mutation c.636C &gt; T in POMGNT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression analysis revealed that this apparently silent mutation compromises correct premessenger <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) splicing, promoting skipping of the entire exon 7, with a consequent frameshift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In silico analysis of this mutation did not predict alterations in the canonical splice sequences, but rather the creation of a new exonic splice silencer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The recognition of such disease-causing elements may contribute to the further understanding of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> processing and assist mutation screening in routine diagnosis, where such changes may be underestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To aid clinical diagnosis, we generated publicly available LOVD-powered Locus Specific Databases for these three genes and recorded <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known sequence variants ( http://www.dmd.nl ) </plain></SENT>
