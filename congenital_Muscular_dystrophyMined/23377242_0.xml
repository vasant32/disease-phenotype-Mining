<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To minimize the uncertainty in clinical diagnosis and improve the classification of 14 Tunisian patients belonging to 12 families and affected with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen patients belonging to 12 unrelated families originating from the south of Tunisia and affected with CMD were clinically examined between 1990 and 2001 in the neurology service of Chu Habib Bourguiba, Sfax, Tunisia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical and western blot analyses were used to explore protein expression in muscular biopsies and homozygosity mapping using microsatellite markers for the genetic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These analyses were performed in the human molecular genetics laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the patients tested with anti-merosin antibodies, 3 showed total laminin-a2 deficiency and the remaining patients showed partial laminin-a2 deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients expressed normally a-sarcoglycan, b-dystroglycan and dystrophin except 2 showing reduction of expression in a-sarcoglycan and b-dystroglycan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Linkage analysis, performed for 8 families, was compatible with linkage to the LAMA2 gene for only 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results showed that clinical and immunohistochemical analyses have allowed classification of only 3 patients, immunohistochemical and genotyping studies have contributed to the classification of 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the remaining cases, there is no evident classification due to the lack of the genetic exploration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results also confirmed the broad spectrum of phenotypes associated with a defect in laminin-a2 </plain></SENT>
