<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 6-year-old sibling has a severe form of MEB disease, which in some aspects is more suitable with the diagnosis of Walker-Warburg syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the same mutation resulted in a less severe form of MEB in the older sibling, who is 14 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These two cases suggest that POMGnT1 mutations may cause MEB disease with different phenotypes even in the same family </plain></SENT>
