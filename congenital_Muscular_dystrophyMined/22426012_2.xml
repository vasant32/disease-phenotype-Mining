<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Panel testing offers the ability to efficiently and cost-effectively screen <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the genes for a particular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the analytical sensitivity and specificity of two different enrichment technologies, solution-based hybridization and microdroplet-based PCR target enrichment, in conjunction with next-generation sequencing (NGS), to identify mutations in 321 exons representing 12 different genes involved with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>Congenital muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> present diagnostic challenges due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>phenotypic variability</z:hpo>, lack of standard access to and inherent difficulties with muscle immunohistochemical stains, and a general lack of clinician awareness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NGS results were analyzed across several parameters, including sequencing metrics and genotype concordance with Sanger sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genotyping data showed that both enrichment technologies produced suitable calls for use in clinical laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, microdroplet-based PCR target enrichment is more appropriate for a clinical laboratory, due to excellent sequence specificity and uniformity, reproducibility, high coverage of the target exons, and the ability to distinguish the active gene versus known pseudogenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regardless of the method, exons with highly repetitive and high GC regions are not well enriched and require Sanger sequencing for completeness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrates the successful application of targeted sequencing in conjunction with NGS to screen for mutations in hundreds of exons in a genetically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> human disorder </plain></SENT>
