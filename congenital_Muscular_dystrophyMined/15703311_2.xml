<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The hospital ethics committee approved this study, and informed consent was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (five boys, four girls; age range, 3-9 years; mean, 6 years +/- 2 [standard deviation]) with merosin-deficient CMD underwent T1-weighted, T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and (1)H <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy, which was performed in the parieto-occipital WM (POWM) and frontal WM (FWM) by using stimulated-echo acquisition mode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Metabolite (N-acetylaspartate [<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>], <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi>-containing compounds [Cho], and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17268">myo-inositol</z:chebi> [mI]) ratios were calculated in relation to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi>/phosphocreatine (Cr) and water (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cho was also calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi> were calculated in approximately the same locations that were studied with spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For comparison, (1)H <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy (n = 10) and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> mapping (n = 7) were also performed in 10 healthy age- and sex-matched control subjects (three boys, seven girls; age range, 4-9 years; mean, 6 years +/- 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis involved the t test for comparison between different groups; correlation between <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and spectroscopy results was studied with the Pearson test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging revealed evidence of bilateral WM involvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whereas their <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr and Cho/Cr were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, their mI/Cr was slightly increased compared with that in control subjects (P = .03 in FWM and P = .07 in POWM), and their <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cho was decreased in POWM (P = .03) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was significant correlation between <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values and metabolite/water ratios (r = -0.777 to -0.967, P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
