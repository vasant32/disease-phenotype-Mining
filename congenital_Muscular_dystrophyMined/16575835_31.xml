<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The importance of O-glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG) is evident from the identification of POMT1 mutations in Walker-Warburg syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately one-fifth of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> patients show mutations in POMT1, which result in complete loss of protein mannosyltransferase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> patients are characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) with severe brain and eye abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This suggests a crucial role for alpha-DG during development of these organs and tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we report new POMT1 mutations and polymorphisms in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we report different compound heterozygous POMT1 mutations in four unrelated families that result in a less severe phenotype than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e>, characterized by CMD with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008981'>calf hypertrophy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> patients, these patients have milder structural brain abnormalities, and eye abnormalities were absent, except for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo> in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these patients we postulate that one or both transcripts for POMT1 confer residual protein O-mannosyltransferase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest the existence of a disease spectrum of CMD including brain and eye abnormalities resulting from POMT1 mutations </plain></SENT>
