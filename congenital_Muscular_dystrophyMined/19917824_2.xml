<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> 2I (LGMD2I) is caused by mutations in the fukutin-related protein gene FKRP, which is also involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (MDC1C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical, biological, radiological and mutational characteristics of LGMD2I patients with FKRP mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven patients from nine families from the north of France were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographical data, muscular testing results, cardiac and respiratory examinations, muscle histological features and a genetic analysis of the FKRP gene for each patient are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight patients underwent brain MRI and seven neuropsychological tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients included six women and five men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 9 years (range 1.5 to 23 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients remained self-ambulatory, whereas the other six were confined to a wheelchair by a mean age of 19 years, after a mean disease duration of 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine patients suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002111'>restrictive respiratory insufficiency</z:hpo>, and two male patients had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological tests revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> in four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI revealed cerebral abnormalities in four patients (4/8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ten patients were carriers of the common L276I mutation, which was either homozygous (four patients) or heteroallelic with another mutation (six patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among the mutations found, three were novel: L322V, L489R and R275G </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals inter- and intrafamilial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>phenotypic variability</z:hpo> in LGMD2I, with a preponderance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardiopathy</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002111'>restrictive respiratory insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It also demonstrates central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> involvement, probably associated with changes in alpha-dystroglycan expression in the brain </plain></SENT>
