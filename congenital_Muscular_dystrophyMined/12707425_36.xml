<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mutations in the fukutin-related protein gene FKRP cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (LGMD2I) as well as a form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (MDC1C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To define the phenotype in LGMD2I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors assessed 16 patients from 14 families with FKRP gene mutations and LGMD and collected the results of mutation analysis, protein studies, and respiratory and cardiac investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen patients, most with adult presentation, were homozygous for the common C826A mutation in FKRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The three other cases were compound heterozygotes for C826A and two of them presented in childhood, with more progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pattern of muscle involvement, frequently including <z:hpo ids='HP_0008981'>calf hypertrophy</z:hpo>, was similar to dystrophinopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complications in patients with LGMD2I were common and sometimes out of proportion to the skeletal muscle involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six patients had cardiac involvement, and 10 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory impairment</z:hpo>: five required nocturnal respiratory support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase at least 5 to 70 times <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most consistent protein abnormality found on muscle biopsy was a reduction of laminin alpha2 immunolabeling, either on muscle sections or immunoblotting alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LGMD2I due to FKRP mutations appears to be a relatively common cause of LGMD, with respiratory and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> as prominent complications </plain></SENT>
