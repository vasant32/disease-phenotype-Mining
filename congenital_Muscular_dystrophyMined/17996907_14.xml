<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The detailed process of how <z:mp ids='MP_0000752'>dystrophic muscles</z:mp> are replaced by fibrotic tissues is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the immunolocalization and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in muscles from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and dystrophic human muscles were examined with the goal of elucidating the pathophysiological function of CTGF in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biopsies of frozen muscle from patients with Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD), Becker <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>muscular dystrophy, congenital</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0007269'>spinal muscular atrophy</z:hpo>, congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> were analyzed using anti-CTGF polyclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was also performed to evaluate the expression of CTGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in <z:mp ids='MP_0000752'>dystrophic muscles</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> muscle, neuromuscular junctions and vessels were CTGF-immunopositive, which suggests a physiological role for CTGF in these sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0000752'>dystrophic muscle</z:mp>, CTGF immunoreactivity was localized to muscle fiber basal lamina, regenerating fibers, and the interstitium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Triple immunolabeling revealed that activated fibroblasts were immunopositive for CTGF and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR analysis revealed increased levels of CTGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the muscles of DMD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Co-localization of TGF-beta1 and CTGF in activated fibroblasts suggests that CTGF expression is regulated by TGF-beta1 through a paracrine/autocrine mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, TGF-beta1-CTGF pathway may play a role in the <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> that is commonly observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
