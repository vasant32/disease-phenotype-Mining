<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinically, the patient had characteristic features and magnetic resonance imaging findings of Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dystrophin analysis revealed a lack of the C-terminal domain but preserved N-terminal and rod domains of dystrophin in biopsied muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, she had reduced expression of merosin, syntrophin, and beta-dystroglycan in the skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the patient's muscle illustrated a complete lack of exons 71-74 of the dystrophin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These deletions, which remove the beta-dystroglycan and syntrophin binding site, may cause changes in the function of both beta-dystroglycan and syntrophin in human muscle </plain></SENT>
