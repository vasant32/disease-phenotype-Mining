<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We isolated a fragment of the fukutin gene promoter from differentiated human NT2 cells using chromatin immunoprecipitation technique with an anti-CREB antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This fragment contained a CRE-like sequence and here we describe its functional validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the element was functional in vitro and in vivo and that CREB in neurons was involved in the transcriptional regulation of the fukutin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, its expression in neurons was regulated by cAMP and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39124">calcium ions</z:chebi>, known triggers of CREB phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first report on the regulation of fukutin gene by transcription factor CREB in response to the signals generated by synaptic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The true biological function of fukutin, the gene responsible for Fukuyama-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, is at present not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, it has been suggested that it might possess glycosyltransferase activity and its intracellular localization within the Golgi structures is consistent with this function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As such, fukutin might play a significant role in post-translational modification of synaptic proteins in neuronal cells </plain></SENT>
