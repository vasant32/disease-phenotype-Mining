<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Differential diagnosis of FCMD from Duchenne and Becker <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> (DMD/BMD) or other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> is occasionally difficult, because of their phenotypic similarity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The gene (FCMD) responsible for FCMD at 9q31 was isolated in 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Japan, most FCMD-bearing chromosomes (87%) have a 3-kb retrotransposal insertion into the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the gene that could be derived from a single ancestral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutations have been identified in Japanese FCMD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Severe phenotype was significantly more frequent in patients who were compound heterozygotes for a point mutation and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutation, than in homozygotes for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We developed a PCR-based diagnostic method for a rapid detection of the retrotransposal insertion mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using this system, we screened 18 FCMD patients, and found 16 homozygotes and two heterozygotes for the insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated the carrier frequency in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six of 676 persons were recognized as a heterozygous carrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found three homozygotes for the FCMD <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutation among 97 patients who had been said to have probable DMD/BMD without any DMD mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, there were no FCMD homozygotes but four heterozygous carriers among 335 patients with DMD mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic method we developed will provide a rapid and reliable diagnosis of FCMD, which can bring important information in genetic counseling, such as the accurate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo>, recurrence risk and a life expectancy </plain></SENT>
