<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> are associated with the defective glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan and many are now known to result from mutations in a number of genes encoding putative or known glycosyltransferases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These diseases include severe forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) such as Fukuyama type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD), Muscle-Eye-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain disease</z:e> (MEB) and Walker-Warburg syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e>), which are associated with brain and eye abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The defective glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan in these disorders leads to a failure of alpha-dystroglycan to bind to extra-cellular matrix components and previous attempts to model these disorders have shown that the generation of fukutin- and Pomt1-deficient knockout mice results in early <z:mp ids='MP_0008762'>embryonic lethality</z:mp> due to basement membrane defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have used the zebrafish as an animal model to investigate the pathological consequences of downregulating the expression of the putative glycosyltransferase gene fukutin-related protein (FKRP) on embryonic development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have found that downregulating FKRP in the zebrafish results in embryos which develop a range of abnormalities reminiscent of the developmental defects observed in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> associated with mutations in FKRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FKRP morphant embryos showed a spectrum of phenotypic severity involving alterations in somitic structure and muscle fibre organization as well as defects in developing neuronal structures and eye <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pathological phenotype was found to correlate with a reduction in alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation and reduced laminin binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further characterization of the developmental processes affected in FKRP morphant embryos may lead to a better understanding of the pathological spectrum observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> associated with mutations in the human FKRP gene </plain></SENT>
