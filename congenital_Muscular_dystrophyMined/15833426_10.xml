<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed clinical, pathological and genetic analyses of 62 Japanese patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, whose skeletal muscle showed deficiency of glycosylated form of alpha-DG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found, the first Japanese patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> 1C with a novel compound heterozygous mutation in the fukutin-related protein gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fukuyama-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> was genetically confirmed in 54 of 62 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients with muscle-eye-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> and one Walker-Warburg syndrome were also genetically confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients had no mutation in any known genes associated with glycosylation of alpha-DG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the molecular mass of alpha-DG in the skeletal muscle was similar and was reduced to approximately 90 kDa among these patients, even though the causative gene and the clinico-pathological severity were different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This result suggests that other factors can modify clinical features of the patients with glycosylation defects of alpha-DG </plain></SENT>
