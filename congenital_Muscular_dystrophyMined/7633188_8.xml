<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cerebral white matter changes have been described in a significant number of individual patients with "pure" <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> without clinical evidence of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cause for the imaging changes is unknown but it is possible that they are the result of abnormal expression in the brain of the gene also responsible for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was performed on seven sibling pairs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intelligence to establish whether imaging changes are consistent within families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> was based on clinical and muscle biopsy findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Children from two families had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> scans; the remaining five sibling pairs showed white matter changes and within each family the changes were virtually identical in severity and distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system changes are consistent within individual families, suggesting that they probably relate to the mutation in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> genes involved in the respective families </plain></SENT>
