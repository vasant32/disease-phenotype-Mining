<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical spectrum ranges from severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> with structural brain and eye involvement to a relatively mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> without brain abnormalities and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intelligence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations have been identified in one of six putative or demonstrated glycosyltransferases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many different FKRP mutations have been identified, which cover the complete clinical spectrum of dystroglycanopathies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the other known genes involved in these disorders, genotype-phenotype correlations are not obvious for FKRP mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To date, no homozygous or compound heterozygous null mutations have been identified in FKRP, suggesting that null mutations in FKRP could result in <z:mp ids='MP_0008762'>embryonic lethality</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We report a family with two siblings carrying a homozygous mutation in the start codon of FKRP that is likely to result in a loss of functional FKRP protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical phenotype of the patients was consistent with Walker-Warburg syndrome, the most severe disorder in the disease spectrum of dystroglycanopathies </plain></SENT>
