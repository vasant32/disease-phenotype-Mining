<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A woman, who had been developmentally delayed since her birth, further deteriorated after she got an episode of high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> of unknown origin at 2 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the age of 52 years, she died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002896'>liver cancer</z:hpo> after a long-standing HB virus carrier state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neuropathological examination revealed brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, narrowed white matter, myelin <z:hpo ids='HP_0000980'>pallor</z:hpo>, fibrillary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0266487" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">status marmoratus</z:e> of the thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested the primary cause of the brain pathology in this case to be a developmental destructive process which should have taken place in the early stage of brain development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo> (NFT) were noticed in the hippocampus, locus ceruleus and nucleus basalis of Meynert, but no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>senile plaques</z:hpo> were found anywhere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These NFT changes seemed to be closely resembling to those of the Fukuyama type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>But the reason why NFT occur in this case is still obscure and probably different from that in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> or in physiological <z:mp ids='MP_0002571'>senility</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
