<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in FKRP are also associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>Congenital Muscular Dystrophy</z:hpo> (MDC1C), Walker-Warburg Syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e>) and Muscle Eye <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain disease</z:e> (MEB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These four disorders share in common an incomplete/aberrant O-glycosylation of the membrane/extracellular matrix (ECM) protein Î±-dystroglycan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, further knowledge on the FKRP structure and biological function is lacking, and its intracellular location is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on immunogold electron microscopy of human skeletal muscle sections we demonstrate that FKRP co-localises with the middle-to-trans-Golgi marker MG160, between the myofibrils in human rectus femoris muscle fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chemical cross-linking experiments followed by pairwise yeast 2-hybrid experiments, and co-immune precipitation, demonstrate that FKRP can exist as homodimers as well as in large multimeric protein complexes when expressed in cell culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The FKRP homodimer is kept together by a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bridge provided by the most N-terminal cysteine, Cys6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FKRP contains N-glycan of high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> and/or hybrid type; however, FKRP N-glycosylation is not required for FKRP homodimer or multimer formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose a model for FKRP which is consistent with that of a Golgi resident type II transmembrane protein </plain></SENT>
