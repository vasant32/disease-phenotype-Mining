<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the COL6A1, COL6A2 (21 q22.3) and COL6A3 (2 q37) genes, encoding the alpha 1, alpha 2 and alpha 3 chains of collagen VI, respectively, have been recently identified as responsible for UCMD in a total of 9 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated in detail the clinical and morphological phenotype of 15 UCMD patients from 11 consanguineous families showing potential linkage either to 21 q22.3 (6 families) or to 2 q37 (5 families) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Collagen VI deficiency was confirmed on muscle biopsies or skin fibroblasts in 8 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients shared a common phenotype, a great variability in severity was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Collagen VI deficiency in muscle or cultured fibroblasts was complete in the severe cases and partial in the milder ones, which suggests a correlation between the degree of collagen VI deficiency and the clinical severity in UCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant phenotypical differences were found between the families linked to each of the 2 loci, which confirms UCMD as a unique entity with underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
