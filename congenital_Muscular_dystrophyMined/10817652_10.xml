<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In typical Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD), peak motor function is usually only unassisted sitting or sliding on the buttocks, though a few patients are able to walk at some point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a few patients have a severe phenotype and never acquire head control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, it is clinically difficult to differentiate this severe FCMD from Walker-Warburg syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e>) or from muscle-eye-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> (MEBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to establish a genotype-phenotype correlation, we performed haplotype analysis using microsatellite markers closest to the FCMD gene (FCMD) in 56 Japanese FCMD families, including 35 families whose children were diagnosed as FCMD with the typical phenotype, 12 families with a mild phenotype, and 9 families with a severe phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 12 propositi with the mild phenotype, 8 could walk and the other 4 could stand with support; 10 cases were homozygous for the ancestral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> (A-F) haplotype whereas the other 2 were heterozygous for the haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 9 severe cases, who had never acquired head control or the ability to sit without support, 3 had progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, 2 required a shunt operation, and 7 had ophthalmological abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis showed that 8 of the 9 cases of the severe phenotype are heterozygous for the A-F haplotype, and the other one homozygous for the haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We confirmed that at least one chromosome in each of the 56 FCMD patients has the A-F haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rate of heterozygosity for the A-F haplotypes was significantly higher in severe cases than in typical or mild cases (P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Severe FCMD patients appeared to be compound heterozygotes for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutation and another mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the present study yielded molecular genetic evidence of a broad clinical spectrum in FCMD </plain></SENT>
