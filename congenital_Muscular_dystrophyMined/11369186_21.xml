<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease is characterized by marked dystrophic changes in skeletal muscles during early infancy, while little is known about the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath> of the muscle fiber degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the immunohistochemical analysis of skeletal muscle in ten patients with primary merosin-deficient CMD using a panel of molecular markers for skeletal muscle proteins, <z:mp ids='MP_0000316'>cellular necrosis</z:mp>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the youngest patient (a 52 day old baby), prominent massive muscle cell degeneration occurred in association with the deposition of the C5-9 complement membrane attack complex (MAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most of the MAC-positive muscle fibers showed a severely deranged immunoreaction to dystrophin, dystroglycans, and other sarcolemmal proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found scattered positive signals for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar but milder changes were also observed in six other patients younger than 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the patients older than 3 years, muscle fibers positive for MAC and apoptotic signals were barely detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings imply that massive muscle fiber degeneration occurs in the very early stage of merosin-deficient CMD and may contribute to the severe dystrophic changes in muscle from early infancy </plain></SENT>
