<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Humans with merosin-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> have both sucking problems during infancy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037315" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sleep-disordered breathing</z:e> during childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that merosin-deficient pharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0003646'>muscles fatigue</z:mp> faster than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was tested in vitro using sternohyoid muscle from an animal model of this disease, the dy/dy dystrophic mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Isometric twitch contraction and half-relaxation times were similar for dy/dy and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sternohyoid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, rate of force loss during repetitive 25-Hz train stimulation was markedly diminished in dystrophic compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sternohyoid muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, force potentiation, which occurred during the early portion of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>-inducing stimulation, had a longer duration in dystrophic compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> muscle (approximately 60 versus 20 s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a result of these two processes, at the end of 2 min of stimulation, force of <z:mp ids='MP_0000752'>dystrophic muscle</z:mp> had decreased by 8 +/- 5% and that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> muscle by 69 +/- 4% (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50509">potassium-channel blocker</z:chebi>, 3,4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51598">diaminopyridine</z:chebi>, increased force of dy/dy sternohyoid muscle during twitch and 25-Hz contractions by 148 +/- 20% (p &lt; 0.00001) and 109 +/- 18% (p &lt; 0.00002), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During repetitive 25-Hz stimulation, force of 3,4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51598">diaminopyridine</z:chebi>-treated <z:mp ids='MP_0000752'>dystrophic muscle</z:mp> remained significantly higher than that of untreated muscle, despite the early force potentiation being eliminated and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> being accelerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, merosin deficiency reduces <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> and prolongs the duration of force potentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The latter alterations may partially preserve the integrity of upper airway muscle function, without which the severity of pharyngeal complications (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011968'>feeding problems</z:hpo>, sleep-related respiratory dysfunction) might be even more pronounced in the human merosin-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
