<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in COL6A1, COL6A2 and COL6A3 genes cause Ullrich <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>Congenital Muscular Dystrophy</z:hpo> (UCMD), Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>Myopathy</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611706" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Myosclerosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Col6a1(-/-) mice and collagen VI deficient zebrafish display a myopathic phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, two additional collagen VI chains were identified in humans, the α5 and α6 chains, however their distribution patterns and functions in human skeletal muscle have not been thoroughly investigated yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By means of immunofluorescence analysis, the α6 chain was detected in the endomysium and perimysium, while the α5 chain labeling was restricted to the myotendinous junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> muscle cultures, the α6 chain was present in traces in the ECM, while the α5 chain was not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the absence of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi>, the α6 chain was mainly accumulated into the cytoplasm of a sub-set of desmin negative cells, likely of interstitial origin, which can be considered myofibroblasts as they expressed α-smooth muscle actin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TGF-β1 treatment, a pro-fibrotic factor which induces trans-differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, increased the α6 chain deposition in the extracellular matrix after addition of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In order to define the involvement of the α6 chain in muscle <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> we studied biopsies of patients affected by Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>Muscular Dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found that the α6 chain was dramatically up-regulated in fibrotic areas where, in contrast, the α5 chain was undetectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results show a restricted and differential distribution of the novel α6 and α5 chains in skeletal muscle when compared to the widely distributed, homologous α3 chain, suggesting that these new chains may play specific roles in specialized ECM structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While the α5 chain may have a specialized function in tissue areas subjected to tensile stress, the α6 chain appears implicated in ECM remodeling during muscle <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
