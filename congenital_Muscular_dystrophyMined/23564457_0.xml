<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Collagen VI is a ubiquitously expressed extracellular microfibrillar protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its most common molecular form is composed of the α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI) collagen α chains encoded by the COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3 genes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in any of the three collagen VI genes cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> types Bethlem and Ullrich as well as intermediate phenotypes characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> and connective tissue abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The α3(VI) collagen α chain has much larger N- and C-globular domains than the other two chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Its most C-terminal domain can be cleaved off after assembly into microfibrils, and the cleavage product has been implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we characterize a Col6a3 mutant mouse that expresses a very low level of a non-functional α3(VI) collagen chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mutant mice are deficient in extracellular collagen VI microfibrils and exhibit myopathic features, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0003199'>decreased muscle mass</z:hpo> and contractile force </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructurally abnormal collagen fibrils were observed in tendon, but not cornea, of the mutant mice, indicating a distinct tissue-specific effect of collagen VI on collagen I fibrillogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, the mice lacking <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> α3(VI) collagen chains displayed mild musculoskeletal phenotypes similar to mice deficient in the α1(VI) collagen α chain, suggesting that the cleavage product of the α3(VI) collagen does not elicit essential functions in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> growth and development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Col6a3 mouse mutant lacking functional α3(VI) collagen chains thus serves as an animal model for COL6A3-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
