<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No muscle fibers or intramuscular nerves stained with merosin antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On electron microscopy, the basement membrane of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the muscle fibers was very poorly discernible and there were occasional disruptions, while the basement membrane of the Schwann cells was well preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the sarcolemmal basement membrane in merosin-positive CMD was well preserved even in patient with severe interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It remains to be determined how the defective basement membrane in merosin-negative CMD induces defective sarcolemma and eventual fiber <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
