<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 40% of patients with CMD have a primary deficiency of the laminin alpha 3. chain of merosin (laminin-2) due to mutations in LAMA2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Laminin-2 bound to alpha-dystroglycan forms a link between actin--associated cytoskeletal proteins and the components of extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Disruption of this axis is responsible for several forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A profound reduction of alpha-dystroglycan and less pronounced secondary deficiency of alpha 2-laminin were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> known forms of CMD were excluded, and the disorder was diagnosed as so far undescribed form of CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mutation in a gene encoding the protein, that seems to play a role in a glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, is presumed </plain></SENT>
