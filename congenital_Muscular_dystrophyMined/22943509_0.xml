<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Laminin-α2-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e>) is a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle-wasting</z:hpo> disease for which no curative treatment is available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">Antagonists</z:chebi> of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor type 1 (AT1), including the anti-hypertensive drug <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi>, have been shown to block also the profibrotic action of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and thereby ameliorate disease progression in mouse models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and failure of <z:mp ids='MP_0000750'>muscle regeneration</z:mp> are the main reasons for the severe disease course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e>, we tested whether L-158809, an analog derivative of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi>, could ameliorate the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> in dyW/dyW mice, the best-characterized model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: L-158809 was given in food to dyW/dyW mice at the age of 3 weeks, and the mice were analyzed at the age of 6 to 7 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of L-158809 on muscle histology and on <z:mp ids='MP_0000750'>muscle regeneration</z:mp> after injury as well as the locomotor activity and muscle strength of the mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that TGF-β signaling in the muscles of the dyW/dyW mice was strongly increased, and that L-158809 treatment suppressed this signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consequently, L-158809 reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in skeletal muscle of dyW/dyW mice, and largely restored <z:mp ids='MP_0000750'>muscle regeneration</z:mp> after toxin-induced injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mice showed improvement in their locomotor activity and grip strength, and their body weight was significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data provide evidence that AT1 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> ameliorate several hallmarks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> in dyW/dyW mice, the best-characterized mouse model for this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because AT1 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> are well tolerated in humans and widely used in clinical practice, these results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> may offer a potential future treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> </plain></SENT>
