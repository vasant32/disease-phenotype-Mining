<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the laminin isoform composition of the basement membranes (BMs) in the human extraocular muscles (EOMs) and relate it to the fact that EOMs are spared in laminin alpha2-chain-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Samples from adult human EOMs and limb muscle were processed for immunocytochemistry, with monoclonal antibodies against laminin chains (Ln) alpha1 to -5, beta1 and -2, and gamma1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) were identified with acetylcholinesterase reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The capillary density was measured in sections stained with anti-Lnalpha5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The extrasynaptic BM of the EOM muscle fibers contained Lnalpha2, -beta1, -beta2, and -gamma1, and, in contrast to limb muscle, it also contained Lnalpha4 and -alpha5, to some extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distinct laminin composition of the EOMs was confirmed by the presence of Lutheran protein, an alpha5-chain-specific receptor not found in limb muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the NMJs, there was increased expression of Lnalpha4 and expression of Lnalpha2, -alpha5, -beta1, -beta2, and -gamma1 was also maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The capillary density was very high (1050 +/- 190 capillaries/mm(2)) in the EOMs and significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher in the orbital (1170 +/- 180 capillaries/mm(2)) than in the global (930 +/- 110 capillaries/mm(2)) layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The human EOMs showed important differences in laminin isoform composition and capillary density when compared with human limb muscle and muscles of other species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of additional laminin isoforms other than laminin-2 in the BM of the extrasynaptic sarcolemma could partly explain the sparing of the EOMs in Lnalpha2-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
