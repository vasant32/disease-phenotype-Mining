<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper revealed the contributive role of TIMP-1 in progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (PMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods We examined the expression and cellular localization of TIMP-1 protein using biopsied frozen muscle from patients with Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD), Becker <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (BMD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) by immunohistochemistry, double immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results The results of immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence showed that TIMP-1 was positive only in vascular endothelial cells of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis showed that the staining intensity was distinctly increased in some <z:mp ids='MP_0000752'>dystrophic muscles</z:mp> of PMD for TIMP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Double immunofluorescence revealed that TIMP-1 strongly expressed in the regenerating muscle fibers, macrophages and macrophage infiltrating necrotic fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some activated fibroblasts in endomysium and perimysium of DMD and CMD muscles were also positive for TIMP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusion The functional consequence of overexpression of TIMP-1 in the <z:mp ids='MP_0000752'>dystrophic muscles</z:mp> is unknown, but the elevated local expression of TIMP-1 in diseased muscles of PMD and their distinct distribution pattern provide evidence that TIMP-1 may participate in the pathogenesis of PMD </plain></SENT>
