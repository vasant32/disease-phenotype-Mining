<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The oldest child died at 6 months of age, from respiratory complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The second-14 month old- does not sit without support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The muscle fibres are of unequal calibre and numerous fibres have under-sarcolemmal <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> positive areas contain <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi>, as seen on electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the second patient, the biochemical analysis showed a moderate <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> accumulation and muscular enzymatic studies demonstrated an isolated and major deficiency in phosphofructokinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Activity was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in red blood cells and in fibroblasts cultured in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hence, these cases should be distinguished from formerly reported cases of phosphofructokinase deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This type of P.F.K. deficiency should be looked for in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and early joint involvement </plain></SENT>
