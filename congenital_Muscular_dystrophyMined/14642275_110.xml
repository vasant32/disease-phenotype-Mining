<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Targeted deletion of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> kinase (fak) in the developing dorsal forebrain resulted in local disruptions of the cortical basement membrane located between the neuroepithelium and pia-meninges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At disruption sites, clusters of neurons invaded the marginal zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Retraction of radial glial endfeet, midline fusion of brain hemispheres, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> also occurred, similar to type II <z:hpo ids='HP_0007260'>cobblestone lissencephaly</z:hpo> as seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, targeted deletion of fak in neurons alone did not result in cortical <z:mp ids='MP_0002185'>ectopias</z:mp>, indicating that fak deletion from glia is required for neuronal mislocalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, fak deletion specifically from meningeal fibroblasts elicited similar cortical <z:mp ids='MP_0002185'>ectopias</z:mp> in vivo and altered laminin organization in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These observations provide compelling evidence that FAK plays a key signaling role in cortical basement membrane assembly and/or remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, FAK is required within neurons during development because neuron-specific fak deletion alters dendritic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in the absence of lamination defects </plain></SENT>
