<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aberrant glycosylation of the protein has been linked to various forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unusually α-DG has previously been demonstrated to be modified with both O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28800">N-acetylgalactosamine</z:chebi> and O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> initiated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, Fc-tagged recombinant mouse α-DG was expressed and purified from human embryonic kidney 293T cells. α-DG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24396">glycopeptides</z:chebi> were characterized by glycoproteomic strategies using both nano-liquid chromatography matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization and electrospray tandem mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 14 different <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> sequences and 38 glycopeptides were identified which displayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> O-glycosylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data provide new insights into the complex domain-specific O-glycosylation of α-DG </plain></SENT>
