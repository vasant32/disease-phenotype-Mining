<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed 58 autopsy cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo> which were clinically diagnosed at the Aichi Prefecture Colony Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of the cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo> had brainweights that were 60-70% of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brainweight for their ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, approximately 20% of the brains were not small, especially in cases over 20 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The brains of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo> cases showed wide morphological variation, and were classified into thinned cerebral mantle type (10 cases), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> type (three cases) and microgyria-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001302'>pachygyria</z:hpo> type (45 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Macroscopic morphometric analysis was performed in the brains of the microgyria-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001302'>pachygyria</z:hpo> type using the coronal whole brain sections through the mammillary bodies stained with Kl√ºver-Barerra (KB) stain, and compared with the brains of four cases of the Fukuyama type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD), two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001339'>lissencephaly</z:hpo>, and nine cases of non-neural diseases as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The morphometric values of the coronal sections in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo> cases showed diminished white matter with more dilatated ventricles compared with the control brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This tendency was stronger in the brains of spastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo> cases than in the brain of athetotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>Cerebral palsy</z:hpo>, in terms of the morphological complexity of the cerebrum as determined by the morphometric analysis, was situated between FCMD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001339'>lissencephaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although microscopic analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo> brains was limited to 19 cases, there were four brains with heterotopic gray matter, three brains with cortical folding, a sign of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo>, and three brains with neuronal cytomegaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, more than half of the brains showed disorganization of lamination in the cortex with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo> of neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that some cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo> may result from disrupted neuronal migration during cortical development </plain></SENT>
