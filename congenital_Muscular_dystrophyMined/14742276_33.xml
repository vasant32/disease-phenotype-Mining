<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We recently identified mutations in the fukutin related protein (FKRP) gene in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> type 1C (MDC1C) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> type 2I (LGMD2I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sarcolemma of these patients typically displays an immunocytochemical reduction of alpha-dystroglycan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report we extend these observations and report a clear correlation between the residual expression of alpha-dystroglycan and the phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three broad categories were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients at the severe end of the clinical spectrum (MDC1C) were compound heterozygote between a null allele and a missense mutation or carried two missense mutations and displayed a profound <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of alpha-dystroglycan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with LGMD with a Duchenne-like severity typically had a moderate reduction in alpha-dystroglycan and were compound heterozygotes between a common C826A (Leu276Ileu) FKRP mutation and either a missense or a nonsense mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Individuals with the milder form of LGMD2I were almost invariably homozygous for the Leu276Ile FKRP mutation and showed a variable but subtle alteration in alpha-dystroglycan immunolabeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data therefore suggest a correlation between a reduction in alpha-dystroglycan, the mutation and the clinical phenotype in MDC1C and LGMD2I which supports the hypothesis that dystroglycan plays a central role in the pathogenesis of these disorders </plain></SENT>
