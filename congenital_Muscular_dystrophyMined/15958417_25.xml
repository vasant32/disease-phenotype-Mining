<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the human homolog (LARGE) have been described in a form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (MDC1D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other genes (POMT1, POMGnT1, fukutin, and FKRP) that encode known or putative glycosylation enzymes are also causally associated with human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these diseases are associated with hypoglycosylation of the membrane protein alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG) and consequent loss of extracellular ligand binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hence, they are termed dystroglycanopathies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A paralogous gene for LARGE (LARGE2 or GYLTL1B) may also have a role in DG glycosylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using database interrogation and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we identified vertebrate orthologs of each of these LARGE genes in many vertebrates, including human, mouse, dog, chicken, zebrafish, and pufferfish </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, within invertebrate genomes, we were able to identify only single homologs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that vertebrate LARGE orthologs be referred to as LARGE1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR, dot-blot, and northern analysis indicated that LARGE2 has a more restricted tissue-expression profile than LARGE1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>-tagged proteins, we show that both LARGE1 and LARGE2 localize to the Golgi apparatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The high similarity between the LARGE paralogs suggests that LARGE2 may also act on DG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of LARGE2 in mouse C2C12 myoblasts results in increased glycosylation of alpha-DG accompanied by an increase in laminin binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, there may be functional redundancy between LARGE1 and LARGE2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this idea, we show that alpha-DG is still fully glycosylated in kidney (a tissue that expresses a high level of LARGE2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) of Large(myd) mutant mice </plain></SENT>
