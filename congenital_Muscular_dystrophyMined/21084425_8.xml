<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays a key role in protein degradation in skeletal muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to identify new targets for drug therapy against <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e>, we have investigated whether increased proteasomal degradation is a feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the generated dy(3K)/dy(3K) mutant mouse model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e>, we studied the expression of members of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in laminin α2 chain-deficient muscle, and we treated dy(3K)/dy(3K) mice with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitor</z:chebi> MG-132 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that members of the UPS are upregulated and that the global ubiquitination of proteins is raised in dystrophic limb muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, phosphorylation of Akt is diminished in diseased muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, proteasome inhibition significantly improves the dystrophic dy(3K)/dy(3K) phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specifically, treatment with MG-132 increases lifespan, enhances locomotive activity, enlarges muscle fiber diameter, reduces <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, restores Akt phosphorylation and decreases <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These studies promote better understanding of the disease process in mice and could lead to a drug therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
