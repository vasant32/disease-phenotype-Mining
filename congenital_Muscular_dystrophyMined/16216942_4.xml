<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine if laminin-alpha2 deficiency is due to mutations in the LAMA2 gene or secondary to mutations in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed molecular analysis of LAMA2, by single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing, in 15 patients with undetectable or greatly reduced laminin-alpha2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also performed 4 prenatal diagnoses and investigated a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found 1 known and 9 previously undescribed LAMA2 mutations spanning <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> protein domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These were nonsense or frameshifts causing laminin-alpha2 absence or, in 1 case, a homozygous missense mutation producing partial protein expression and milder phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LAMA2 mutations were undetected in 5 patients, in 2 of whom FKRP mutations explained the phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 3 prenatal cases, the fetus was heterozygous for the mutation of interest and pregnancy continued; in 1 case, the fetus was affected and aborted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients, the Cys967Stop mutation and identical haplotypes flanking the LAMA2 gene indicated a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The clinical phenotype was severe in most patients with LAMA2 mutations and associated with undetectable protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One case with no protein and another with partial expression had milder phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter alterations</z:hpo> on magnetic resonance imaging were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with LAMA2 mutations, supporting the utility of magnetic resonance imaging in differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutation (Cys967Stop) probably originated in Albania </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Genetic characterization of affected families is mainly of use for prenatal diagnosis </plain></SENT>
