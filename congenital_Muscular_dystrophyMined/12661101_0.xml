<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> merosin-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) with torticollis and/or developmental dislocation of the hip in early childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of merosin-positive CMD was based on their clinical and <z:mp ids='MP_0000752'>dystrophic muscle</z:mp> biopsy findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the age 13 months, patient 1 was found to have developmental dislocation of both hips, which was surgically treated at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient 2 had severe torticollis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contracture</z:hpo> of both hip joints which had been present since the neonatal period, and underwent repair of the torticollis at 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient 3 was found to have developmental dislocation of the left hip at one month of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although she had generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001252'>muscle hypotonia</z:hpo> she learned to walk at 23 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>She had no facial muscle involvement nor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contracture</z:hpo> of joints, but had hyperlaxity of distal joints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Her muscle biopsy showed complete collagen VI deficiency immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to merosin-deficient CMD, merosin-positive CMD appears to be a group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since collagen VI was reported to be defective in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ullrich's disease</z:e>, patient 3 may be diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ullrich's disease</z:e> but had no typical clinical characteristics of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further study is needed to identify the pathogenetic mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> with early joint abnormalities to determine whether there is a primary abnormality of the connective tissue including collagen VI </plain></SENT>
