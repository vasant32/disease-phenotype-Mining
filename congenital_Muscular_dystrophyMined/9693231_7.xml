<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Merosin, the laminin alpha2 chain located on the surface of muscle fibers, has recently been shown to be absent in a subset of cases with the classical type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (Cl-CMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By immunocytochemistry and immunoblot analysis, using monoclonal antibodies to both the 80- and the 320-kDa fragments, the same protein was found to be only partially deficient in 3 of our cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these 3 patients were able to walk, with evidence of a mild to moderate muscle involvement, as opposed to the merosin-negative cases which are never ambulant because they are affected by severe muscular deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them also suffered from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, a clinical expression of brain involvement rarely described in cases with merosin-negative CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 3 patients with CMD and partial merosin deficiency were investigated by brain MRI and pattern reversal visual evoked potentials (VEP) associated with electroretinography (ERG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with those obtained by similar studies on 3 of our cases with complete merosin deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both types of patients, the neuroimaging evaluation showed supratentorial white matter changes, usually of moderate degree, irrespective of the amount of merosin detected in muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The VEP were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 3 cases with partial merosin deficiency, whereas they showed reduced amplitude or prolonged latency in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 3 cases with the merosin-negative form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ERG was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As a whole, our data indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> does not seem to distinguish between the two variants of Cl-CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, a benign muscle involvement and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> VEP findings seem to distinguish CMD patients with partial merosin deficiency from those with complete deficiency of the same protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>Late onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, evident in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> our 3 cases with partial merosin deficiency, needs to be evaluated in a larger series of patients in order to be considered a characteristic of this variant of CMD </plain></SENT>
