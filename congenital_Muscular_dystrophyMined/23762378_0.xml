<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>Congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> is a distinct group of diseases presenting with <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> in infancy or childhood and no current therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One form, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e>, is the result of laminin alpha-2 deficiency and results in significant <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory insufficiency</z:hpo> and early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Modification of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is one potential pathway for therapy in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: dy(2J) mice were treated with vehicle, 0.1 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg of omigapil daily via oral gavage over 17.5 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Untreated age matched BL6 mice were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional, behavioral and histological measurements were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: dy(2J) mice treated with omigapil showed improved respiratory rates compared to vehicle treated dy(2J) mice (396 to 402 vs. 371 breaths per minute, p&lt;0.03) and similar to control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no statistical differences in normalized forelimb grip strength between dy(2J) and controls at baseline or after 17.5 weeks and no significant differences seen among the dy(2J) treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 30-33 weeks of age, dy(2J) mice treated with 0.1 mg/kg omigapil showed significantly more movement time and less rest time compared to vehicle treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>dy(2J) mice showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardiac systolic function throughout the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>dy(2J) mice had significantly lower hindlimb maximal (p&lt;0.001) and specific force (p&lt;0.002) compared to the control group at the end of the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences in maximal or specific force among treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>dy(2J) mice treated with 0.1 mg/kg/day omigapil showed decreased percent <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in both gastrocnemius (p&lt;0.03) and diaphragm (p&lt;0.001) compared to vehicle, and in diaphragm (p&lt;0.013) when compared to 1 mg/kg/day omigapil treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Omigapil treated dy(2J) mice demonstrated <z:mp ids='MP_0006043'>decreased apoptosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Omigapil therapy (0.1 mg/kg) improved respiratory rate and decreased skeletal and respiratory muscle <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in dy(2J) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These results support a putative role for the use of omigapil in laminin deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
