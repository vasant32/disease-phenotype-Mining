<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Victor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Dubowitz</z:e> (1997) wrote that to go back to the "dark ages", when there was still no CMD, we do not need to go back <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> that far; in the 1960s, many people were not recognizing the existence of CMD or in fact actively denying it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 1960, Fukuyama and his colleagues published a short report of 15 CMD cases, delineating 9 clinical diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 1961, he presented detailed features of 25 cases at a formal national convention of Japanese Society of Neurology, the essence of which was widely approved by Japanese colleagues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The situation in foreign countries was quite different, however; its international recognition as a unique independent entity delayed till early 1980s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eventually, FCMD was enlisted in MIM as OMIM 253800 in 1986, and in WHO's <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10 NA as G71.084 in 1990 for the first time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Toda et al localized a responsible FCMD gene at 9q31-33 in 1993 and identified fukutin gene in 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Another revolution took place in 1994, that is, laminin 2 deficiency was first identified in Western CMD patients by Tom√© et al in 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This discovery gave a great impact to Western investigators, because in Western population, this condition is prevalent while FCMD was practically non-existent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>World literature survey revealed that 1,963 articles on CMD had been published since 1893 till 2006, composing from 726 papers contributed by Japanese authors and 1,137 papers by non-Japanese authors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For the period 2001-2006, contribution by non-Japanese authors dramatically increased, occupying 66% of the total </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Anyhow, the discovery of FCMD is worth as a historical landmark in dual sense </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>First, it convinced world authorities the fact the CMD is a real component of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Second, it provided a new concept on pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> in general, emphasizing multisystemic involvement rather than muscle alone </plain></SENT>
