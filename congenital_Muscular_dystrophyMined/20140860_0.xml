<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze and characterize the clinical, molecular pathological and genetic features of a Chinese family with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> type 1A (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical data of the proband and her family members were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry staining was performed on muscular biopsy tissues with anti-merosin, alpha-dystroglycan, beta-dystroglycan and dystrophin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNAs from the patient and her parents were extracted using standard procedures from the peripheral blood leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PCR and DNA direct sequencing were employed to analyze <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the 65 exons of the LAMA2 gene to determine the gene mutation, and the relationships between genotype and phenotype were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proband presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001270'>delayed motor development</z:hpo> and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002058'>myopathic face</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Her midrange <z:hpo ids='HP_0003236'>elevated serum creatine kinase</z:hpo> (CK) levels and white matter signal intensity changes are consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e>, and was clinically diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemistry analysis for the proband exhibited complete loss of merosin staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further test with PCR detected a homozygous mutation of c.817A&gt;T in exon 5, while her parents were heterozygotes for the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The authors have defined the clinical manifestation of the Chinese family with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The proband carried a homozygous nonsense mutation c.817A&gt;T, and her parents were heterozygous carriers, consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
