<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We assessed scans from 83 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026848" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">muscle disorders</z:e> characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> of the spine secondary to mutations in 4 different genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The conditions studied were <z:hpo ids='HP_0003306'>rigid spine</z:hpo> syndrome (SEPN1 defects), Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, and Ullrich <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, allelic disorders caused by Col6A1, Col6A2, and Col6A3 mutations, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> form of Emery-Dreifuss <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (LMNA defects) and calpain-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CAPN3 defects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The scans of 25 patients affected by other <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> were also reviewed as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The scans were compared with the previously described patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 82% of the scans in the study group (68/83) the patterns were classified as "typical" of 1 of the 5 forms studied, and in 7 (8%) were consistent with 1 of the reported patterns but not entirely typical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With one exception, the patterns identified were always consistent with the appropriate genetic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining scans (9%) had only minimal changes and were uninformative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the scans of the 25 patients in the control group had patterns that could be classified as typical of the 5 forms examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity to detect selective patterns in relation to the genetic diagnosis was 0.9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that muscle magnetic resonance imaging could be used in clinical practice as an additional tool in the differential diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026848" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">muscle disorders</z:e> with prominent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003306'>spinal rigidity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
