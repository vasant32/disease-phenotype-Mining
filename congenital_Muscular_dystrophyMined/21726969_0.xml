<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fukutin (FKTN), the responsible gene for FCMD, encodes a protein involved in the glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have experienced some patients with FCMD who showed sudden exacerbation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> with marked elevation of serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase (CK) and urinary <z:chebi fb="2" ids="7044">myoglobin</z:chebi> levels a few days after a febrile episode of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, occasionally leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To describe this peculiar phenomenon, we focused on 12 patients who developed a sudden exacerbation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> among 96 genetically defined FCMD patients and hospitalized because of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0743841" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">febrile illness</z:e> at Tokyo Women's Medical University between 1997 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the 12 patients were homozygous for a 3-kb insertion mutation of FKTN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients developed exacerbation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> ranging from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> to loss of head control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was concentrated in summer, and coxsackieviruses and enteroviruses were most often detected, especially in infantile patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 12 patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and recovered within 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients were treated without steroid, and needed 18.5 days on mean for improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
