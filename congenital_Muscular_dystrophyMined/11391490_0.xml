<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The recent discovery of the dystrophin-associated complex of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> led to the delineation of sarcoglycanopathies, a phenotypically similar to dystrophinopathies group of clinically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this paper is to report the clinical, biochemical, histological, immunohistochemical and molecular genetics characteristics observed in a case of adhalinopathy (alpha-sarcoglycanopathy or LGMD2D) presenting in early months of life and resembling <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL CASE: An 12-year old school boy, the third son of a healthy, young, non consanguineous couple, presented at birth with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100336'>bilateral cleft lip</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> and mild <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At age 6 months it was believed he suffered from a benign form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> on the basis of clinical, biochemical, electrophysiological and histological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From 5 years onwards he had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002359'>frequent falls</z:hpo> and climbing stairs had become increasingly difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, a positive Gowers 'sign, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0008981'>calf hypertrophy</z:hpo>, high serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi>-phosphokinase level and myopathic electromyographic features were present; otherwise, cardiological evaluation and intelligence were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A repeated muscular biopsy at 10 years showed dystrophic features as well as selective deficiency of adhalin on immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DNA analysis demonstrated the patient being homozygote for a R77C mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Actually, a marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0002938'>lumbar lordosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002515'>waddling gait</z:hpo>, an impossibility of climbing stairs and arising from the floor in addition to absent rotulian reflexes and mild Achilles retraction are present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LGMD2D may present in the first months of life mimicking <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It seems reasonable that biopsies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> new cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> be selectively immohistochemical analyzed, and when it is possible the diagnosis should be confirmed by DNA analysis </plain></SENT>
