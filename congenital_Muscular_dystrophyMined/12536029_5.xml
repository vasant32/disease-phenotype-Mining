<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study encompassed 41 floppy infants aged 2-24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The muscle US and EMG examinations were performed without awareness of the clinical diagnosis </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neurogenic group consisted of 16 infants according to their US and EMG findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of them had <z:hpo ids='HP_0007269'>spinal muscular atrophy</z:hpo> proven by genetic analysis and one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> diagnosed by nerve biopsy </plain></SENT>
