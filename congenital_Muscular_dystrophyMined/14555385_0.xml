<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty consecutive muscle biopsies in the Department of Pathology, National University of Singapore, in the period 1978-2000, in which a clinical diagnosis of floppy or hypotonic infant was made, were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The commonest cause of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0008947'>hypotonia in infancy</z:hpo> was <z:hpo ids='HP_0007269'>spinal muscular atrophy</z:hpo>, which accounted for 33% of cases followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight cases (10%) of infantile type II <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017919" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">glycogenosis</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017921" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="AMD">Pompe's disease</z:e>) were encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were seven cases of congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, of which four were centronuclear <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, and one each of central core <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, nemaline <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> and congenital fibre type disproportion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One case of centronuclear <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> was associated with type I fibre smallness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Type II <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, which is generally considered a non-specific change, was encountered in five cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of interest is the relatively large number of muscle biopsies (29%) in which no significant pathological features were encountered at the light microscopic, histochemical as well as ultra-structural level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study has revealed a great variety of pathology affecting the muscle of children presenting as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270971" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">floppy infants</z:e> or with <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The muscle diseases included <z:hpo ids='HP_0007269'>spinal muscular atrophy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophies</z:hpo>, congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> and metabolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, 23 (29%) cases showed no significant pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For this group of floppy and hypotonic infants further studies are needed </plain></SENT>
