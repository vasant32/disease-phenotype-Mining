<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the clinical and neuroradiological follow-up of 2 Italian sisters, 10 and 6 years of age, affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) with divergent <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In both, CMD was diagnosed by finding dystrophic alterations in muscle biopsy and muscular deficit at birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The elder sister suffered also from marked intellectual deficit and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, as usually reported in children with Fukuyama CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the same patient, at 2 years of age, CT scan showed severe hypodensity of cerebral white matter and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> of occipital horns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 8 years of age, MRI also showed clearcut <z:hpo ids='HP_0001302'>pachygyria</z:hpo> mainly in the parietal and occipital lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI and CT scan at the same age showed improvement of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> and unchanged <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo>, as reported for patients with Fukuyama CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unlike Japanese cases, however, she showed no progression in her muscular deficit and her muscle immunostaining of laminin M chain (merosin) was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The younger sister had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mental development, never experienced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic fits</z:e> and had always <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, as often seen in classical CMD, her CT scan showed moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0003429'>hypomyelination</z:hpo> of cerebral white matter and mild <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of lateral ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MRI did not show any other brain abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sequential CT scan at 2, 4 and 6 years of age showed improvement of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Her muscular deficit had a stationary clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Her immunostaining of muscle merosin was moderately reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The finding of Fukuyama-like and classical CMD in 2 sisters indicates the possibility that different forms of CMD may be different expressions of the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
