<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The merosin M-chain (or laminin-alpha 2) is one of three subunits of laminin-2 which is highly expressed in striated muscle and peripheral nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complete lack of laminin-alpha 2 expression in skeletal muscle is the hallmark of one form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> which is characterized by dysmyelination of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>), links to chromosome 6q2 and is common among Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Laminin-alpha 2 expression was also found to be significantly reduced in Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> which links to chromosome 9q3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report consistently preserved laminin-2 expression, including laminin-alpha 2, as detected by immunofluorescence in skeletal muscle from five patients with Walker-Warburg syndrome which is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and, in addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0007260'>type II lissencephaly</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001302'>pachygyria</z:hpo>, defective <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> myelination, and ocular dysgenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings show that in spite of partial phenotypic overlap between Fukuyama CMD and Walker-Warburg syndrome the two disorders are nosologically separate disease entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They also exclude that Walker-Warburg syndrome is allelic to the common form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> with laminin-alpha 2 deficiency </plain></SENT>
