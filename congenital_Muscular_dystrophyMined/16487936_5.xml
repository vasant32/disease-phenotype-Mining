<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three disorders share a common etiologic defect in the dystrophin-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> complex, which connects muscle structural proteins with the extracellular basement membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the pathophysiology of these CMDs, we generated microarray gene expression profiles of skeletal muscle from patients in various clinical stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite diverse pathological changes, the correlation coefficient of overall gene expression among these samples was considerably high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed a multi-dimensional statistical analysis, the Distillation, to extract determinant genes that distinguish CMD muscle from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Up-regulated genes were primarily extracellular matrix (ECM) components, whereas down-regulated genes included structural components of mature muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations reflect active interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> with less active regeneration of muscle cell components in the CMDs, characteristics that are clearly distinct from those of DMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> varied among the specimens tested, ECM gene expression was consistently high without substantial changes through the clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, in situ hybridization showed more prominent ECM gene expression on muscle cells than on interstitial tissue cells, suggesting that ECM components are induced by regeneration process rather than by '<z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath>.' These data imply that the etiology of FCMD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> differs from that of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase of classical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, and the major pathophysiologic change in CMDs might instead result from primary active <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
