<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This disease is characterized by extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle wasting</z:hpo> that results in extremely weak skeletal muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A large percentage of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> are faced with respiratory as well as ambulatory difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of overexpressing insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) as a potential therapeutic target for the disease in the Lama2(Dy-w) mouse, a model that closely resembles human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IGF-1 transgenic Lama2(Dy-w) mice showed increased survivability, body weight and muscle weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, these mice showed better ability to stand up on their hind limbs: a typical exploratory behavior seen in healthy mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histology and immunohistochemistry analyses revealed increased regenerative capacity and proliferation in IGF-1 transgenic Lama2(Dy-w) muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis showed increased phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2, both known to enhance myogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we saw increases in the expression of the regeneration markers MyoD, myogenin and embryonic myosin (myosin heavy chain 3, MYH3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that overexpression of IGF-1 in Lama2(Dy-w) mice increases lifespan and improves their overall wellbeing mainly through the restoration of impaired <z:mp ids='MP_0000750'>muscle regeneration</z:mp>, as <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was not impacted by IGF-1 in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0684309" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">disease model</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that IGF-1 has a promising therapeutic potential in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> </plain></SENT>
