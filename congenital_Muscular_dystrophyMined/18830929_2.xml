<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Expression profiles of sarcospan in muscles with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> are scarcely reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine this, we studied five Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD) muscles, five Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD) muscles, five disease control and five <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot showed reactions of sarcospan markedly decreased in FCMD and DMD muscle extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry of FCMD muscles showed that most large diameter myofibers expressed sarcospan discontinuously at their surface membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immature small diameter FCMD myofibers usually did not express sarcospan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity of sarcospan in DMD muscles was similarly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With regard to dystroglycans and sarcoglycans, immunohistochemistry of FCMD muscles showed selective deficiency of glycosylated alpha-dystroglycan, together with reduced expression of beta-dystroglycan and alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta-sarcoglycans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the expression of glycosylated alpha-dystroglycan was lost, scattered FCMD myofibers showed positive immunoreaction with an antibody against the core protein of alpha-dystroglycan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The group mean ratios of sarcospan <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> copy number versus GAPDH <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> copy number by real-time RT-PCR showed that the ratios between FCMD and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control groups were not significantly different (P&gt;0.1 by the two-tailed t test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study implied either O-linked glycosylation defects of alpha-dystroglycan in the Golgi apparatus of FCMD muscles may lead to decreased expression of sarcoglycan and sarcospan molecules, or selective deficiency of glycosylated alpha-dystroglycan due to impaired glycosylation in FCMD muscles may affect the molecular integrity of the basal lamina of myofibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This, in turn, leads to decreased expression of sarcoglycans, and finally of sarcospan at the FCMD myofiber surfaces </plain></SENT>
