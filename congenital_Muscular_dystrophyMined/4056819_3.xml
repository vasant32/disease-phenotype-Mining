<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsies from 10 Japanese patients (9 females and 1 male) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their clinical features varied remarkably in severity; one patient died at 6 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Family history was negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient who had an affected sibling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsy findings varied from mild myopathic to advanced dystrophic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hypertrophic fibers associated with occasional <z:hpo ids='HP_0003555'>fiber splitting</z:hpo> were assumed to reflect a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dystrophic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histochemical examination revealed type 1 fiber predominance in 5 patients, and type 2 fiber predominance in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had a slight to moderate increase in the number of undifferentiated type 2C fibers suggesting a regenerating process after fiber <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Type 2B fibers were fairly well preserved in 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall findings differed from those of the Fukuyama type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD) and Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD) in which more active fiber <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and regeneration are seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the present CMD patients suffered from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dystrophic process similar to that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
