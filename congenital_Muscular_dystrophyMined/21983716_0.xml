<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical feature of a Chinese family with muscle-eye-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> (MEB) and the mutation of protein O-linked-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> beta-1, 2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 gene (POMGNT1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical data of the proband and his family members were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA from the patient and his parents was extracted using standard procedures from the peripheral blood leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction and DNA direct sequencing were employed to analyze <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the exons to determine the mutation, and the relationship between genotype and phenotype was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proband was diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270971" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">floppy baby</z:e>, presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>delayed psychomotor development</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002058'>myopathic face</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>His serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase (CK) level elevated moderately and brain MRI showed cerebral and cerebellar gyrus abnormalities with white matter signal intensity changes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002350'>cerebellar cysts</z:hpo> and cerebellar and brain stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath>, consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> with eye <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further test with DNA detected a compound heterozygous mutation of c.1896 1 G to C before exon 22 which may induce splicing error, and missense mutation c.1319T to G, p.L440R in exon 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both parents had a heterozygous mutation at the mutation sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: According to our study, the family is diagnosed as MEB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The proband carried compound heterozygous mutations in the POMGNT1 gene, and his parents are heterozygous carriers, which is consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The child is definitely diagnosed as having muscle eye <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
