<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the LARGE gene have been identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> patients with brain abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the precise function of LARGE remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we found that LARGE could act as a bifunctional glycosyltransferase, with both xylosyltransferase and glucuronyltransferase activities, which produced repeating units of [-3-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18222">xylose</z:chebi>-α1,3-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24298">glucuronic acid</z:chebi>-β1-] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This modification allowed α-DG to bind laminin-G domain-containing ECM ligands </plain></SENT>
