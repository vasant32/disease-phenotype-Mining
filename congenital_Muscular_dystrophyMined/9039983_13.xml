<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>About half of the children with classical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) show an absence in their skeletal muscle of laminin alpha2 chain, one of the components of the extracellular matrix protein, merosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Linkage analysis implicated the laminin alpha2 chain gene (LAMA2) on chromosome 6q2, now confirmed by the discovery of mutations in the laminin alpha2 chain gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have further investigated the location of the LAMA2 locus on chromosome 6q2, using both linkage analysis in nine informative families and homozygosity mapping in 13 consanguineous families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four of these families only had mild or moderate down regulation of laminin alpha2 chain expression and a milder phenotype; the rest had no protein or only a trace </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the informative families, including those with partial laminin alpha2 expression, was compatible with linkage to chromosome 6q2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This observation expands the spectrum of the phenotype secondary to laminin alpha2 chain deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the LAMA2 locus is more centromeric than previously proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recombinant events place the locus between markers D6S470 and D6S1620 in an interval of less than 3 cM </plain></SENT>
