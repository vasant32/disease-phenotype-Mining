<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, a deficiency of merosin has been reported in patients with classical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD), while other patients, with indistinguishable clinico-pathological features, do not present this deficiency, suggesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present investigation was to assess merosin distribution and quantity in 21 clinically well characterized Brazilian CMD patients, in order to: a) estimate the proportion of merosin-deficient cases in this group of patients; b) characterize phenotypically merosin-negative, as compared to merosin-positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Merosin deficiency was found in 11 patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the seven who had been submitted to neuroimaging studies showed evidence of periventricular dysmyelination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pattern of 43 DAG was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, which suggest that this protein is not preferentially involved in a third form of merosin-positive CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results from the present study are further suggestive, but do not prove, that the association of merosin deficiency with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter alterations</z:hpo> represents a genetic entity with common clinical, laboratory and neuroimaging findings </plain></SENT>
