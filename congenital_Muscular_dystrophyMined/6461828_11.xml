<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Muscles from 13 patients with clinical characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement (Fukuyama type) (FCMD) were examined using morphometric and fiber type analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The muscles from patients aged 5 months to 3 years demonstrated small-calibered fibers with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003557'>increased variation in fiber size</z:hpo>, connective tissue proliferation, and scattered necrotic and regenerating fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Groups of atrophic fibers were absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both type 1 and type 2 fibers were affected, though type 1 fibers predominated and type 2B fibers decreased as the disease progressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The muscle changes were apparently progressive, affecting not only the limbs but also the intercostal, diaphragm, and cardiac muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although there was no qualitative difference in the muscle histochemistry between FCMD and Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD), there was a greater proportion of type 2C fibers and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> was present at the early infantile stage of FCMD </plain></SENT>
