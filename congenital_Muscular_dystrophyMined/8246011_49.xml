<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In FCMD muscle, we found a significant reduction of laminin M (merosin; a striated muscle specific basal lamina-associated protein) with approximately 26% of levels seen in controls by quantitative immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other CMD and DMD muscles showed less dramatic reductions (78%, 80%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The localization of laminin M was also abnormal in FCMD muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laminin B1 and B2 showed abnormalities similar to those observed with laminin M, but were less marked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Laminin A was only detected in rare regenerating fibers in control biopsies, whereas it was seen around most muscle fibers in FCMD patients, and in dystrophin deficient muscle fibers from DMD patients and its carrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Staining intensity of type IV collagen in FCMD muscle was not significantly different from the other diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings may implicate a primary or central role for the basal lamina in FCMD muscle </plain></SENT>
