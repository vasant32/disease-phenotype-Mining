<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Laminin alpha2 chain mutations cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> with dysmyelination <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, we demonstrated that laminin alpha1 chain ameliorates the disease in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dystroglycan and integrins are major laminin receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unlike laminin alpha2 chain, alpha1 chain binds the receptors by separate domains; laminin globular (LG) domains 4 and LG1-3, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the laminin alpha1 chain is an excellent tool to distinguish between the roles of dystroglycan and integrins in the neuromuscular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we provide insights into the functions of laminin alpha1LG domains and the division of their roles in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> pathogenesis and rescue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of laminin alpha1 chain that lacks the dystroglycan binding LG4-5 domains in alpha2 chain deficient mice resulted in prolonged lifespan and improved health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, diaphragm and heart muscles were corrected, whereas limb muscles were dystrophic, indicating that different muscles have different requirements for LG4-5 domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the regenerative capacity of the skeletal muscle did not depend on laminin alpha1LG4-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, this domain was crucial for preventing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in limb muscles, essential for myelination in peripheral nerve and important for basement membrane assembly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results show that laminin alpha1LG domains and consequently their receptors have disparate functions in the neuromuscular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Understanding these interactions could contribute to design and optimization of future medical treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
