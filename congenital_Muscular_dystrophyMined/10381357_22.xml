<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Laminin alpha2 deficiency induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> with DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Caspases, which are involved in various types of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, are sequentially activated through a processing by other members of caspases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By using a cleavage site-directed antibody against caspase-3 that specifically reacts with the active form of caspase-3, we immunochemically demonstrated that caspase-3 is activated in the skeletal muscle fiber of dy/dy mice and that some of the activated caspase-3 muscle fibers are TUNEL-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus the lack of laminin alpha2 signals activates caspase-3, resulting in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of muscle fibers </plain></SENT>
