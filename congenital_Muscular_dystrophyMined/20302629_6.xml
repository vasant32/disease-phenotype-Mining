<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We have designed a custom oligonucleotide CGH array in order to investigate the presence of CNVs in the coding and non-coding regions of COL6A1, A2, A3, A5 and A6 genes and a group of genes functionally related to collagen VI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A cohort of 12 patients with UCMD/BM negative at sequencing analysis and 2 subjects carrying a single COL6 mutation whose clinical phenotype was not explicable by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> were selected and the occurrence of allelic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A deletion within intron 1A of the COL6A2 gene, occurring in compound heterozygosity with a small deletion in exon 28, previously detected by routine sequencing, was identified in a BM patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> studies showed monoallelic transcription of the COL6A2 gene, thus elucidating the functional effect of the intronic deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No pathogenic mutations were identified in the remaining analyzed patients, either within COL6A genes, or in genes functionally related to collagen VI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our custom CGH array may represent a useful complementary diagnostic tool, especially in recessive forms of the disease, when only one mutant allele is detected by standard sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The intronic deletion we identified represents the first example of a pure intronic mutation in COL6A genes </plain></SENT>
