<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pathogenic mutations in the FKRP gene cause both the more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> Type 1C and the milder Limb-Girdle Type 2I form (LGMD2I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report muscle histological alterations and the analysis of 11 muscle proteins: dystrophin, four sarcoglycans, calpain 3, dysferlin, telethonin, collagen VI, alpha-DG, and alpha2-laminin, in muscle biopsies from 13 unrelated LGMD2I patients with 10 different FKRP mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, a typical dystrophic pattern was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In eight patients, a high frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> was also found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A variable degree of alpha2-laminin deficiency was detected in 12 patients through immunofluorescence analysis, and 10 patients presented alpha-DG deficiency on sarcolemmal membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, through Western blot analysis, deficiency of calpain 3 and dystrophin bands was found in four and two patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the remaining proteins showed a similar pattern to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that, in our population of LGMD2I patients, different mutations in the FKRP gene are associated with several secondary muscle protein reductions, and the deficiencies of alpha2-laminin and alpha-DG on sections are prevalent, independently of mutation type or clinical severity </plain></SENT>
