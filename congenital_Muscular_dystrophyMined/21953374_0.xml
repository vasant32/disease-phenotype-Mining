<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This effect was first identified in the Col6a1(-/-) mouse model and then in muscle cell cultures from UCMD and BM patients; the normalizing effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA) confirmed the pathogenic role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi> opening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to determine whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> performance can be used as a criterion for inclusion in clinical trials and as an outcome measure of the patient response to therapy, it is mandatory to establish whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction is conserved in primary cell cultures from UCMD and BM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we report evidence that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction and the consequent increase of apoptotic rate can be detected not only, as previously reported, in muscle, but also in fibroblast cell cultures established from muscle biopsies of collagen VI-related myopathic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> phenotype is no longer maintained after nine passages in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that the dire consequences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction are not limited to myogenic cells, and that this parameter can be used as a suitable diagnostic criterion, provided that the cell culture conditions are carefully established </plain></SENT>
