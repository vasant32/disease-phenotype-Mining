<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A low density area in the cerebral white matter was characteristic of FCMD and a special reference was made to the changes in the white matter low density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was present in 15 patients out of 36 (42%) and frequently seen in the scans obtained on the younger patients; among 11 scans taken of patients between 1 and 2 years of age, 10 scans (91%) showed the white matter low density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Repeated CT scans were carried out on 26 of the 36 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up study revealed that the white matter low density areas were most apparent around the age of one year and decreased or disappeared at 2 or 3 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From these observations, delayed myelination was suspected for the pathogenesis of the low density area found in FCMD </plain></SENT>
