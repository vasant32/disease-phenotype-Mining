<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The essential proteins for NMD include SMG-1, a protein kinase, and Upf, a substrate of SMG-1 with <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> helicase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated the effect of NMD inhibition on the phenotype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ullrich disease</z:e>, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, by pharmacological inhibition of SMG-1 or siRNA-mediated knockdown of SMG-1 or Upf1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient studied, showed a homozygous frame-shift mutation with a PTC in the collagen VI alpha2 gene, which encodes a truncated but partially functional protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient's fibroblasts showed a nearly complete loss of the triple-helical collagen VI protein and functional defects in the extracellular matrix (ECM) due to the crucial deficiency of the collagen VI alpha2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have shown that NMD inhibition causes the up-regulation of the mutant collagen VI a2 subunit, resulting in the assembly of mutant triple-helical collagen VI and the formation of partially functional ECM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that specific inhibition of NMD may be useful as a therapeutic approach to treat some human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic diseases</z:e> exacerbated by NMD </plain></SENT>
