<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In every patient, at least one EMG examination detected <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathic changes</z:hpo> that were predominant in proximal muscles, although EMG performed at birth was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brief bursts of high-frequency repetitive discharges were electrically elicited in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Uniformly slowed motor NCVs without signs of denervation were observed in seven patients: five merosin-deficient, one merosin-positive, and one with unavailable merosin status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The merosin-deficient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> also involved sensory nerves in three patients and worsened with age in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, myopathic EMG changes were typical and early findings in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> was detected in most patients with merosin-deficient CMD, and also in a child with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> merosin expression </plain></SENT>
