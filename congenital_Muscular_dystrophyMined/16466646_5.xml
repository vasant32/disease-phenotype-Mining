<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that the disruption of fukutin protein produces the brain pathology through hypoglycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG), we immunostained Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD) brains with an antibody that recognizes the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18154">polysaccharide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> of alpha-DG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity of the glia-limitans along the cortical surface, as well as that of the glial endfeet around vessel walls, was preserved in the FCMD cerebrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, fragmentation of the immunostained glia-limitans was noted in association with parenchymal protrusion and gyral fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the FCMD cerebellum, this fragmentation of alpha-DG labeling was limited to the area of micropolygyria, and immunostaining at the glia-limitans and vessel walls was comparable to that of the control brains, in structurally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the hippocampus, neurons of the dentate gyrus and corpus ammonis were immunopositive for alpha-DG in control subjects, but this staining was markedly decreased in FCMD brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, immunolabeling of blood vessels and the glia-limitans was preserved in this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fukutin antisera clearly labeled hippocampal neurons in control brains, while this labeling was decreased in FCMD brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, hypoglycosylation of alpha-DG was evident in neurons, but not in the glial cell population of FCMD brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the mechanism of alpha-DG glycosylation may differ between neurons and glial cells, and that a fukutin gene defect may result in functional disruption through hypoglycosylation of both neuronal and glial alpha-DG </plain></SENT>
