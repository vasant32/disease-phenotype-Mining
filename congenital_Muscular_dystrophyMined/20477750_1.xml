<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we report immunohistochemical, Western-blot and genetic analyses in a large consanguineous Tunisian family with two branches, including seven patients sharing similar LGMD2 phenotype in one branch and one CMD patient in the other branch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Linkage analyses were compatible with the LGMD2A locus in one branch and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> congenital type 1A) locus in the other branch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This result was supported by deficiency in merosin and calpain3 in the CMD patient and LGMD patients respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutation analysis revealed two distinct mutations: a c.8005delT frameshift deletion in exon 56 of the LAMA2 (laminin-Î±2) gene (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e>) was found in the CMD patient and a new homozygous mutation c.1536+1G&gt;T in the donor splice site of intron 12 of the CAPN3 (calpain3) gene (LGMD2A) was found in the LGMD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR) performed on total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from a LGMD2A patient's muscle biopsy showed complete retention of intron 12 in CAPN3 cDNA, generating a PTC (premature termination codon) that potentially elicits degradation of the nonsense <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> by NMD (nonsense-mediated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> decay) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> analysis is necessary to clarify the primary effect of genomic mutations on splicing efficiency that alters <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> processing and expression level </plain></SENT>
