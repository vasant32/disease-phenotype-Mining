<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conventional imaging techniques such as X-ray CT scan and MRI are ineffective for visualization of these brain surface anomalies </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, reconstructed horizontal images visualized structural derangement such as abnormal protrusion of white matter into gray matter </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate the efficacy of the present method for the differential diagnosis between FCMD and DMD with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo>, which is essential for the genetic study to identify the causative gene of FCMD </plain></SENT>
