<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Ullrich's form is characterized by proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>joint contractures</z:hpo> and distal hiperextensibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>About 40% of these patients present mutations in one of the genes that codify the sub-units of the collagen VI protein (COL6), producing total or partial deficiency of the protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed, through immunohistochemistry, the expression of COL6 in muscle fragments of 50 patients with CMD; 20 of them presented merosin expression deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified 4 cases with total COL6 deficiency (8% of the total), representing 13% of the cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> merosin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The histological findings of patients with deficiency of COL6 were indistinguishable from other forms of CMD, but milder than that abnormalities observed in merosin deficient patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In three COL6 deficient patients were observed <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> in the neonatal period, delayed of motor milestones, muscular retractions of knees and elbows, distal joint hiperextensibility and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001374'>congenital hip dislocation</z:hpo> (two patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient lost the ability to walk; and one died due to respiratory problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The analysis of COL6 expression, as well as merosin expression, in the muscle tissue from CMD patients, can be important for identification and phenotypic characterization of different CMD subtypes </plain></SENT>
