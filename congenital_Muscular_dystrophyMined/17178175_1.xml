<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The laminin-alpha2 chain, referred to as merosin, forms part of the laminin-2 heterotrimer (alpha2beta1gamma1), which is principally expressed in the basement membrane of muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nearly half of patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) have abnormalities in the laminin-alpha2 chain (LAMA2) gene, and the merosin-deficient Lama2dy mouse shows CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of merosin in thymus, the abnormalities in the gland of Lama2dy mice, and the presence of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) in thymus prompted us to study the possible effects of the deficiency of merosin on thymus BuChE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that, while AChE activity decreased by approximately 50% in merosin-deficient thymus, the deficiency had little effect on BuChE activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>About 65% of thymus BuChE activity was extracted with a saline buffer and 30% with 1% <z:chebi fb="60" ids="29234">Triton</z:chebi> X-100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sedimentation analyses and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> chromatography showed that thymus contained amphiphilic BuChE monomers (G(1)(A),44%) and dimers (G(2)(A),33%), and hydrophilic tetramers (G(4)(H),23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Binding assays with various plant lectins revealed differences between the oligoglycans linked to BuChE tetramers and lighter components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The deficiency of merosin had no effect on the biosynthesis of thymus BuChE as judged by the lack of major changes between control and Lama2dy mice thymuses in the distribution of BuChE molecules and the level of lectin binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The detoxifying action of BuChE, its role as a backup to AChE, and the relevance of the cholinergic dialogue between T cells and stromal cells for T lymphocyte proliferation, maturation and survival support a physiological function for BuChE in thymus </plain></SENT>
