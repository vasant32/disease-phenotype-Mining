<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ages at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> ranged from 2 to 27 years with a mean of 14.29 +/- 6.18 years and represented a nearly unimodal distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the 12 patients who died before 1983 ranged from 2 to 21 years and averaged 11.58 +/- 5.11 years, whereas the 12 patients who died after 1984 ranged from 3 to 27 years of age and averaged 17.00 +/- 6.44 years </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data on the life spans and cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of FCMD were similar to those studied of Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> by Mukoyama et al (1984, 1986, 1987).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
