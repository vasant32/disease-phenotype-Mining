<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We had mapped the FCMD gene to an approximately 5-cM interval between D9S127 and D9S2111 on 9q31-q33 and had also found evidence for linkage disequilibrium between FCMD and D9S306 in this candidate region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Through further analysis, we have defined another marker, D9S172, which showed stronger linkage disequilibrium than D9S306 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) contig spanning 3,5 Mb, which includes this D9S306-D9S172 interval on 9q31, has been constructed by a combination of sequence-tagged site, Alu-PCR, and restriction mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, cosmid clones subcloned from the YAC were assembled into three contigs, one of which contains D9S2107, which showed the strongest linkage disequilibrium with FCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These contigs also allowed us to order the markers as follows: cen-D9S127-(approximately 800 kb)-D9S306 (identical to D9S53)-(approximately 700 kb)-A107XF9-(approximately 500 kb)-D9S172-(approximately 30 kb)-D9S299 (identical to D9S774)-(approximately 120 kb)-WI2269-tel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, we have constructed the first high-resolution physical map of the FCMD candidate region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The YAC and cosmid contigs established here will be a crucial resource for identification of the FCMD gene and other genes in this region </plain></SENT>
