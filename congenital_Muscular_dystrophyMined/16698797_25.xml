<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Protein O-mannosylation is catalyzed by protein O-mannosyltransferase 1 (POMT1) and its homologue, POMT2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Coexpression of POMT1 and POMT2 is required to show O-mannosylation activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we have shown that POMT1 forms a complex with POMT2 and the complex possesses protein O-mannosyltransferase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results indicate that POMT1 and POMT2 associate physically and functionally in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recently, three mutations were reported in the POMT1 gene of patients who showed milder phenotypes than typical Walker-Warburg syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We coexpressed these mutant POMT1s with POMT2 and found that none of them had any activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> POMT1 mutants, including previously identified POMT1 mutants, coprecipitated with POMT2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the mutant POMT1s could form heterocomplexes with POMT2 but that such complexes are insufficient for enzymatic activity </plain></SENT>
