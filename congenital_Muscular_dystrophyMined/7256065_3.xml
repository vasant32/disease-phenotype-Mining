<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In two young sisters born from consanguineous parents the presenting signs were severe congenital <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> in one and <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002804'>arthrogryposis</z:hpo> in the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two other cases were adult patients with a long standing disease, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> haring been marked by a transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001319'>neonatal hypotonia</z:hpo> in one and by a congenital torticollis in the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 4 patients had progressively increasing muscle retractions, with absent reflexes in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>C.P.K. was moderately increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electromyography demonstrated myopathic abnormalities in 3 cases, associated in 2 cases with misleading pseudo-neurogenic signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MUscle biopsy showed non specific changes compatible with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>: <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and/or fat <z:mpath ids='MPATH_624'>involution</z:mpath> was marked in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, while <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of fibers was rarely observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histoenzymology and morphometry confirmed the absence of lesion specificity and their results were variable from case to case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A review of 92 published cases demonstrated that the course of the disease is very variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A fatal outcome occurs in 15% of cases, while the affection becomes worse or remains stable with about the same frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A progressive worsening of muscle retractions is a characteristic finding in C.M.D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Genetically, most cases are of recessive autosomic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The current nosology of C.M.D. is probably inadequate, the clinical picture including cases that are likely to be due to different mechanisms that 2 present methods of investigation cannot demonstrate </plain></SENT>
