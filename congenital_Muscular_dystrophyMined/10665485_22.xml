<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While <z:hpo ids='HP_0003306'>spinal rigidity</z:hpo> is a nonspecific feature, found in Emery-Dreifuss <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and in some congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo>, it is also a prominent feature in a group of patients with merosin-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, where it is generally associated with stable or only <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, the first locus for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003306'>rigid spine</z:hpo> syndrome was mapped to chromosome 1p35-p36 in consanguineous Moroccan, Turkish, and Iranian families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present here a detailed phenotypic description of the familial syndrome linked to this locus, describing 4 siblings (3 boys and 1 girl) of Northern European-American heritage who are the offspring of a nonconsanguineous marriage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 4 siblings were affected by <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> and prominent neck <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> in infancy, early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003306'>spinal rigidity</z:hpo>, and early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After initial improvement, muscle strength stabilizes or slowly declines, and skeletal deformities and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory insufficiency</z:hpo> supervene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsy in an affected child at age 9 months revealed minimal, nonspecific <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathic changes</z:hpo>, leading to a diagnosis of "minimal change <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>." Muscle biopsy in his sibling, at the age of 14 years, revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and severe myopathic (dystrophic) changes, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> staining for laminin-2 and for proteins of the dystrophin-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A possible explanation for these biopsy findings is that magnetic resonance imaging of the thighs reveals stereotyped selective muscle involvement, with the selectivity more pronounced early in the disease course followed by widespread muscular signal abnormalities in the late stages of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this family, linkage to the chromosome 1p <z:hpo ids='HP_0003306'>rigid spine</z:hpo> syndrome locus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RSMD1</z:e>) is supported by maximum LOD scores for several markers of 1.81 at theta = 0, representing the maximum statistical power possible for this family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In combination with the previous report, this syndrome is linked to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RSMD1</z:e> locus with a summated maximum LOD score of 6.29, and analysis of recombination events in our family narrows the previously reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RSMD1</z:e> locus to 3 centiMorgans </plain></SENT>
