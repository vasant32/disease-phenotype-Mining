<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lamin A/C related <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (L-CMD) is often caused by de novo mutation in LMNA, affecting a single child in a family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Germinal mosaicism is a rarer variant that can lead to two children inheriting the same new heterozygous mutation from a clinically unaffected parent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both patterns mimic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> (AR) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> and the possibility of de novo L-CMD may be forgotten since most causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> follow AR <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To illustrate the challenge of diagnosing L-CMD, we present a consanguineous family in which two children have early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> LMNA-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> likely due to paternal germinal mosaicism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This emphasises that germinal mosaicism (and de novo mutations) for LMNA can arise in any family and direct gene sequencing is required to confirm or exclude the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
