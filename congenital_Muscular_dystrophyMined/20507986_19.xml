<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The main extracellular matrix binding component of the dystrophin-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> complex, alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG), which was originally isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle, is an extensively O-glycosylated protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown alpha-DG to be modified by both O-GalNAc- and O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi>-initiated glycan structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>O-Mannosylation, which accounts for up to 30% of the reported O-linked structures in certain tissues, has been rarely observed on mammalian proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations in multiple genes encoding defined or putative glycosyltransferases involved in O-mannosylation are causal for various forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we explore the glycosylation of purified rabbit skeletal muscle alpha-DG in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using tandem mass spectrometry approaches, we identify 4 O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi>-initiated and 17 O-GalNAc-initiated structures on alpha-DG isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we demonstrate the use of tandem mass spectrometry-based workflows to directly analyze <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24396">glycopeptides</z:chebi> generated from the purified protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By combining glycomics and tandem mass spectrometry analysis of 91 glycopeptides from alpha-DG, we were able to assign 21 different residues as being modified by O-glycosylation with differing degrees of microheterogeneity; 9 sites of O-mannosylation and 14 sites of O-GalNAcylation were observed with only two sites definitively exhibiting occupancy by either type of glycan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The distribution of identified sites of O-mannosylation suggests a limited role for local primary sequence in dictating sites of attachment </plain></SENT>
