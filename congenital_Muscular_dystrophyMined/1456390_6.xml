<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A family in which three siblings were affected with severe cerebral malformations in association with ocular anomalies and muscle disease is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One sibling was diagnosed as having Fukuyama type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD) because he showed severe <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> with dystrophic findings on a muscle biopsy in addition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001302'>pachygyria</z:hpo> on CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the age of 3 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> developed in both eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another sibling exhibited at birth such characteristic features as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001302'>pachygyria</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011815'>cephalocele</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> in both eyes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003236'>elevated serum creatine kinase</z:hpo> activity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002804'>arthrogryposis multiplex congenita</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We consider these findings to be more consistent with Walker-Warburg syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e>) than with FCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002323'>Anencephaly</z:hpo> found in the third sibling was regarded as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> with extreme brain abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The appearance of two syndromes (FCMD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e>) in the three members of the same family suggests that these syndromes could be allelic with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>variable phenotypes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
