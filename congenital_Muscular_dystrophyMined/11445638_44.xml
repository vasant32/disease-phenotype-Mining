<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Fukuyama-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD) is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> disorder characterized by severe dystrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle wasting</z:hpo> from birth or early infancy with structural brain abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gene for FCMD is located on chromosome 9q31, and encodes a novel protein named fukutin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The function of fukutin is not known yet, but is suggested to be an enzyme that modifies the cell-surface <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the roles of fukutin gene mutation in skeletal and cardiac muscles and brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunohistochemical and immunoblot analyses were performed in skeletal and cardiac muscles and brain tissue samples from patients with FCMD and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The authors found a selective deficiency of highly glycosylated alpha-dystroglycan, but not beta-dystroglycan, on the surface membrane of skeletal and cardiac muscle fibers in patients with FCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot analyses also showed no immunoreactive band for alpha-dystroglycan, but were positive for beta-dystroglycan in FCMD in skeletal and cardiac muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The current findings suggest a critical role for fukutin gene mutation in the loss or modification of glycosylation of the extracellular peripheral membrane protein, alpha-dystroglycan, which may cause a crucial disruption of the transmembranous molecular linkage of muscle fibers in patients with FCMD </plain></SENT>
