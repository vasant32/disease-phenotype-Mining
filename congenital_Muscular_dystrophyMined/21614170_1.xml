<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fukutin is a gene responsible for Fukuyama-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD), accompanying ocular and brain malformations represented by <z:hpo ids='HP_0007260'>cobblestone lissencephaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fukutin is related to basement membrane formation via the glycosylation of α-dystoglycan (α-DG), and astrocytes play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the brain lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, its precise function in neurons is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this experiment, the roles of fukutin in mature and immature neurons were examined using brains from control subjects and FCMD patients and cultured neuronal cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In quantitative PCR, the expression level of fukutin looked different depending on the region of the brain examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A similar tendency in DG expression appears to indicate a relation between fukutin and α-DG in mature neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An increase of DG <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and core α-DG in the FCMD cerebrum also supports the relation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In immunohistochemistry, dot-like positive reactions for VIA4-1, one of the antibodies detecting the glycosylated α-DG, in Purkinje cells suggest that fukutin is related to at least a post-synaptic function via the glycosylation of α-DG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As for immature neurons, VIA4-1 was predominantly positive in cells before and during migration with expression of fukutin, which suggest a participation of fukutin in neuronal migration via the glycosylation of α-DG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, fukutin may prevent neuronal differentiation, because its expression was significantly lower in the adult cerebrum and in differentiated cultured cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A knockdown of fukutin was considered to induce differentiation in cultured cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fukutin seems to be necessary to keep migrating neurons immature during migration, and also to support migration via α-DG </plain></SENT>
