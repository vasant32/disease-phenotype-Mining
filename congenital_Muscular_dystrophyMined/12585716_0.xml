<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was performed on two fetal cases of Fukuyama type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> of 18 and 20 weeks' gestation and seven patients with Fukuyama type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> ranging in age from 2 to 27 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight age-matched control cases were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to ascertain the gene phenotype of two child cases, in which prenatal gene analysis was not performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Astrocytes, especially layer I astrocytes, of postnatal cases of Fukuyama type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> were weakly positivefor Nepsilon-(carboxymethyl)lysine and argpyrimidine, suggesting that they were sensitive to <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, and the accumulation may be related to the <z:mp ids='MP_0003634'>abnormal glia</z:mp> limitans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary increase of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> (Mn) <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase against the increase of free radicals was considered in patients with Fukuyama type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> more than 14 years old considered to be homozygous for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> haplotype: homozygosity was suggested by PCR in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, expression of Mn <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase was decreased in 2- and 6-year-old children with Fukuyama type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> that were heterozygous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, accumulation of argpyrimidine was exclusively found in astrocytes of the 2-year-old child that exhibited severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Function of astrocytes might be impaired or immature in severe or heterozygous cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results may confirm that astrocytes play an important role in the etiology of the brain lesion </plain></SENT>
