<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One recently described form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) is associated with deficiency of the alpha 2-chain of laminin, an extracellular matrix protein that is specifically located in the basement membrane of placental villi, Schwann cells and skeletal muscle in healthy humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This laminin is also normally present in the skin, kidney and basement membrane of blood vessels of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>, though it is absent from the blood vessel walls in other tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this immunohistochemical study, we have explored the presence of the alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1 and gamma 1 chains of laminin in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human retina, which are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> localized in the basement membrane of blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study adds to the growing evidence that the alpha 2-chain of laminin is selectively expressed in certain tissues, and suggests that CMD associated with a lack of this protein may be a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0559758" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">multisystem disorder</z:e>, with possible direct involvement of the visual system </plain></SENT>
