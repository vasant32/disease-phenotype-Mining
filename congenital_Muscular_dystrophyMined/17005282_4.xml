<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The functions of fukutin, a gene product responsible for Fukuyama type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, still remain unclear, although a relation to the glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan is presumed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the functions of fukutin, immunohistochemistry, examination using cultured astrocytes, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based binding assay and immunoprecipitation were performed using control muscle and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry showed that alpha-dystroglycan and fukutin were co-expressed, especially in the glial cytoplasm and glia limitans of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An anti-fukutin antibody added to the culture medium did not bring about any changes in the astrocytes cultured on laminin-coated dishes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Together with the immunohistochemical results, the intracellular function of fukutin is considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ELISA-based binding assay and immunoprecipitation may suggest the direct binding of fukutin and alpha-dystroglycan, at least in part </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fukutin seems to bind to both the hypoglycosylated and fully glycosylated form of alpha-dystroglycan, and seems bind to the core area rather than the sugar chain of alpha-dystroglycan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fukutin may directly interact with alpha-dystroglycan during glycosylation, but further examinations are needed to confirm these details </plain></SENT>
