<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study the clinical diagnosis, immunohistochemical feature and follow-up information of CMD, data of 8 cases with CMD were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunohistochemical features of biopsied muscle specimens were summarized and analyzed by using anti-laminin alpha2 (merosin), anti alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG) and anti beta-dystroglycan (beta-DG) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: These patients mostly presented at birth or during the first six months of life with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo>, and feeding difficulty or respiratory dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin staining of skeletal muscle specimens from these patients showed typical characteristics of CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences in fiber size, with predominantly small and round fibers, and dense connective tissue infiltration were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four of the 8 patients were merosin-stain negative, which might be due to primary merosin deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the brain shows abnormalities of the white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four cases were merosin-stain positive, and two of them also had hypoglycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One of them had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic nerve atrophy</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002152'>abnormal brain structure</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Two types of CMD were present in our group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Merosin-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> 1A, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e>) was more common, accompanied by abnormalities of the white matter. "Alpha-dystroglycanopathy" could be seen in merosin-positive cases </plain></SENT>
