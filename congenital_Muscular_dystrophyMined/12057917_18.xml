<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of integrin alpha 7 in muscle pathology, we used a "candidate gene" approach in a large cohort of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antibodies against the intracellular domain of the integrin alpha 7A and alpha 7B were used to stain muscle biopsies from 210 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> of unknown etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Levels of alpha 7A and alpha 7B integrin were found to be decreased in 35 of 210 patients (approximately 17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In six of these patients no integrin alpha 7B was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Screening for alpha 7B mutation in 30 of 35 patients detected only one integrin alpha 7 missense mutation (the mutation on the second allele was not found) in a patient presenting with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>-like phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No integrin alpha 7 gene mutations were identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the other patients showing integrin alpha 7 deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the process of mutation analysis, we identified a novel integrin alpha 7 isoform presenting 72-bp deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This isoform results from a partial deletion of exon 21 due to the use of a cryptic splice site generated by a G to A missense mutation at nucleotide position 2644 in integrin alpha 7 cDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This spliced isoform is present in about 12% of the chromosomes studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that secondary integrin alpha 7 deficiency is rather common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> of unknown etiology, emphasizing the multiple mechanisms that may modulate integrin function and stability </plain></SENT>
