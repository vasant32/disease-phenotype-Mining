<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cases were investigated by 1.5 Tesla MRI equipment using T1-weighted, T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), 3D fast spoiled gradient recalled (SPGR) and post-contrast <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhanced sequences and the diagnosis was confirmed by muscle biopsy with immunohistochemical staining for merosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral subcortical U-fibre white matter changes with periventricular sparing in the first case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Though this imaging finding is non-specific and could be seen in other white matter diseases like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206307" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Canavan disease</z:e>, the absence of other distinguishing MRI and clinical features of those conditions allowed a proper diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second case showed diffuse subcortical and deep white matter involvement and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002350'>cerebellar cysts</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no brainstem involvement, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002126'>polymicrogyria</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0007260'>cobblestone lissencephaly</z:hpo> in both of our cases which allowed differentiation of merosin-negative CMD from other CMDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsy in both these patients showed dystrophic changes with absent staining for merosin confirming the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Merosin-negative CMD should be considered in the imaging differential diagnosis of white matter diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a patient presenting with features of CMD, MRI can be of help in further differentiation of the various CMD subtypes </plain></SENT>
