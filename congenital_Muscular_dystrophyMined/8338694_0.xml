<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The dystrophin test was performed on skeletal muscle specimens from 81 cases with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular diseases</z:e> by using two new monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with those obtained by using four polyclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were raised against various portions of the dystrophin molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On immunohistochemical analysis, the two new monoclonal antibodies showed the same staining pattern as the four polyclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Non-specific immunostaining of the cytoplasm, often seen with polyclonal antibodies, was not observed with monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the application of monoclonal antibodies, the connective tissue sometimes showed non-specific immunostaining which originated from the second fluorescent antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On immunoblot analysis, one of the two monoclonal antibodies, antibody 4-4 C 5, showed weak immunoreactivity, and the 400 kDa dystrophin band was not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three cases out of 15 with Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD), and one case out of 3 with limb-girdle type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> which had previously been diagnosed on the basis of clinical data, were found to have non-dystrophin-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, and Becker <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (BMD), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three and two of five cases were diagnosed as DMD and BMD, respectively, though clinical diagnosis had not been possible because they were too young </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> was confirmed in 9 patients by the dystrophin test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only one of three certain DMD carriers had a so-called mosaic staining pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six antibodies are useful tools for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular diseases</z:e>, because of their high specificity for dystrophin </plain></SENT>
