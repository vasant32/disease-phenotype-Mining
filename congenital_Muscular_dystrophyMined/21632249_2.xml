<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in LMNA cause wide variety of disorders including Emery-Dreifuss <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently found a LMNA mutation in a patient who was previously diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003593'>infantile onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0009071'>inflammatory myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we screened for LMNA mutations in 20 patients suspected to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0009071'>inflammatory myopathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> at 2years or younger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009071'>inflammatory myopathy</z:hpo> was based on muscle pathology with presence of perivascular cuffing and/or endomysial/perimysial lymphocyte infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified heterozygous LMNA mutations in 11 patients (55%), who eventually developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>joint contractures</z:hpo> and/or cardiac involvement after the infantile period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that LMNA mutation should be considered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> patients with inflammatory changes during infancy, and that this may help avoid life-threatening events associated with laminopathy </plain></SENT>
