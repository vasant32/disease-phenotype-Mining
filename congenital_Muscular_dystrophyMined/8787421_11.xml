<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polysomnography confirmed the presence of nocturnal hypoxaemia with oxygen saturation on average less than 90% for 49% of sleep and less than 80% for 19% of sleep accompanied with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002791'>hypoventilation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally there was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbance</z:hpo> characterised by an increased number of wake epochs from deep sleep (in comparison to 10 non-hypoxaemic subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The severity of sleep hypoxaemia did not correlate with symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with night time nasal ventilation was started and repeat polysomnography showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> overnight oxygen saturation and a reduced number of wake epochs during deep sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is important to be vigilant for sleep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002791'>hypoventilation</z:hpo> in these patients and sleep studies should be part of the routine respiratory evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with nasal ventilation is effective in reversing the nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> without significant disturbance to life style </plain></SENT>
