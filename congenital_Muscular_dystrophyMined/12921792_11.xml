<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifteen children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and Ullrich phenotype were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had collagen VI studies in muscle and, when family structure was informative, linkage studies to the collagen 6 loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three of the 15 patients had reduced collagen in muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of the three was from an informative family and linked to one of the collagen 6 loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another patient was linked to one of the collagen 6 loci but had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> expression of collagen in muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining 11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> collagen expression in muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only two of these 11 were from informative families and linkage to collagen 6 loci was excluded in them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had muscle magnetic resonance imaging of their leg muscles using transverse T1 sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With the exception of the two patients in whom linkage to the collagen 6 loci was excluded, the other 13 patients showed the same pattern of selective involvement on magnetic resonance imaging of thigh muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This consisted of relative sparing of sartorius, gracilis, adductor longus and rectus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This pattern was also found in the case linked COL6A1/A2 locus but with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This finding, and the striking clinical and magnetic resonance imaging concordance between patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and reduced collagen VI in muscle suggest that collagen VI could still be the culprit in several cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> collagen expression, or alternatively a primary defect in a protein that closely interacts with collagen VI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mutation analysis of the collagen 6 genes in cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> collagen VI expression is needed to resolve this issue </plain></SENT>
