<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This lecture traces recent advances in knowledge of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo>, as well as their increasing complexity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are described through the eyes of the author from his first exposure to and complete ignorance of the disease in the late 1950s, through the advent of modern techniques, to the molecular genetic revolution, with the recognition of individual genes and proteins for disorders within the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> umbrella </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There initially seemed to be a logical sequence of linked membrane proteins from dystrophin in Duchenne and Becker <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath>, through the dystrophin-associated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> (sarcoglycans) in some of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb girdle muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> (LGMD), to the extracellular matrix protein merosin (alpha-2 laminin) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first spoke in the wheel came with the discovery of a calcium activated protease enzyme, calpain 3, in one form of LGMD, and subsequently another novel non-membrane protein, dysferlin, in another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There are currently at least eight distinct genetic forms of LGMD alone, and another eight separate genetic entities in the CMD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This has highlighted our ignorance of the pathogenesis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> in relation to a diverse array of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033626" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein deficiencies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To compound things further, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> and dominant forms of Emery-Dreifuss <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> have recently been linked to emerin and lamin A/C, respectively, two proteins of the nuclear membrane, opening up yet another new ballpark of discovery </plain></SENT>
