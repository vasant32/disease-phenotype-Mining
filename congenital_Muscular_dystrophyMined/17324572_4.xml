<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its involvement in muscle diseases is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed HSP47 expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> and other muscle diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found an overexpression of HSP47 in fibrous connective tissue and in the adjacent muscle membrane in various <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in Ullrich <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (UCMD), the overexpression of HSP47 was found only in the connective tissue, and not in the muscle membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overexpression of HSP47 was found only in the muscle membrane in the case of active <z:hpo ids='HP_0009071'>inflammatory myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In particular, HSP47 was strongly expressed in the membrane of regenerating fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that HSP47 in the muscle membrane locates in the basement membrane with confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that HSP47 may be involved in the repair or regeneration of muscle fibers in addition to the fibrotic change in the connective tissue </plain></SENT>
