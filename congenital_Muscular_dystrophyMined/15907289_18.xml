<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pathological studies of Fukuyama-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> brain indicated that protrusion of neurons into the subarachnoid space through breaches in the glia limitans-basal lamina complex is a cardinal pathogenic process in this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It remains undetermined, however, whether the defect causing this abnormal migration resides in the migrating neurons or in the glia limitans-basal lamina complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the pathogenesis of brain abnormalities in Fukuyama-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, we analyzed histologically and immunohistochemically the developing forebrain in fukutin-deficient chimeric mice and compared it with that in controls (n=4 in each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In chimeric embryos, <z:mp ids='MP_0002185'>ectopia</z:mp> became apparent as early as embryonic day 14, and laminar organization became progressively distorted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The basal lamina of the cortical surface in chimeras showed defects at E14, coinciding with the earliest time point at which <z:mp ids='MP_0002185'>ectopia</z:mp> were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of glycosylated alpha-dystroglycan showed progressive defects coincidental with the disruption of the basal lamina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neuronal migration was not affected in chimeras, as determined by detection of bromodeoxyuridine-labeled neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Extension of radial glial fibers was intact in chimeras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, disruption of the basal lamina, caused by the loss of interaction between hypoglycosylated alpha-dystroglycan and its ligands, plays a key role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo> in Fukuyama-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
