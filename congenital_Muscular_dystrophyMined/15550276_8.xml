<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The embryotoxic potential of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34631">chlorpyrifos</z:chebi> (CPF) and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="6651">malathion</z:chebi> (MTN), two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25711">organophosphorus insecticides</z:chebi> (OPs), was evaluated by modified Frog Embryo Teratogenesis Assay-Xenopus (FETAX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CPF and MTN were not embryolethal even at the highest concentration tested (6000 microg/l), but both exhibited a powerful teratogenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The probit analysis of malformed larva percentages showed a TC(50) of 161.54mug/l for CPF, and a TC(50) of 2394.01 microg/l for MTN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, CPF teratogenicity was about 15 times higher than MTN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Larvae of both exposed groups were mainly affected by ventral and/or lateral tail flexure coupled with abnormal gut coiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histopathological diagnosis displayed abnormal myotomes and myocytes with marked <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophies</z:mpath> localized at the cell extremity, probably due to a break away of myofibril extremities at the intersomitic junction level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We speculate that this muscular damage was related to inhibition of acetylcholinesterase that showed a clear concentration-response in CPF and MTN exposed larvae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The teratogenic effects of these anti-cholinesterase compounds on Xenopus laevis myogenesis suggest a possible role played by OPs on induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
