<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the brain magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging findings in patients with the "classic" form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intelligence) in relation to the absence of merosin, a recently identified molecular component in the basement membrane of muscle fiber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images in 15 patients (13 children, two adults) were reviewed and correlated with the patient's merosin status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Merosin was evaluated by means of immunocytochemical study of specimens from muscle biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine patients had merosin deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter alterations</z:hpo> similar to those seen in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002415'>leukodystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Periventricular and subcortical white matter were involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The corpus callosum and internal capsule were spared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were available in two patients; changes were <z:hpo ids='HP_0003680'>nonprogressive</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>White matter signal intensity was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the six patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> uniform labeling against merosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>Ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> were observed in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Diffuse white matter changes resembling those seen with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002415'>leukodystrophy</z:hpo> may be a valuable criterion for diagnosis of merosin deficiency in patients with classic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
