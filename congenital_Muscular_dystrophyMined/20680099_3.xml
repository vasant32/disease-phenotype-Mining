<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Some forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> are associated with cortical and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007973'>retinal dysplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Protein O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (POMGnT1) knockout mice, one of the mouse models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, exhibit a thinner retina with reduced density of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> ganglion cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study is aimed to further characterize the knockout retina, with special emphasis on the inner limiting membrane, the basement membrane of the retina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunofluorescence staining and transmission electron microscopy were used to analyze the retinas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Atomic force microscopy was performed on the inner limiting membrane preparations to examine their mechanical properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The inner limiting membrane of the knockout mice exhibited frequent breaks with protrusions of the Müller glial processes and ectopic placement of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> ganglion cells into the vitreous humor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disruptions in inner limiting membrane integrity developmentally precede the cellular abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regions of disrupted inner limiting membrane were also associated with molecular abnormalities of Müller glia that included diminished presence of the integral membrane proteins Kir4.1 (an inwardly rectifying <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel) and aquaporin-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When measured with atomic force microscopy, the POMGnT1 knockout mouse inner limiting membrane (ILM) exhibited significantly reduced Young's modulus and is therefore mechanically weaker than the ILM from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Deficiency of POMGnT1-mediated glycosylation of dystroglycan is implicated in reduced stiffness of the ILM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The weakened ILM results in the disruption of the membrane and subsequent reduction in <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> integrity </plain></SENT>
