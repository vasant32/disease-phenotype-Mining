<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Tracheo-brachiocephalic artery fistulae are critical long-term complications after tracheostomy, reported in 0.6% of patients within three to four weeks after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 30% to 50% of cases there is some <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> prior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> involves sudden massive <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, the prognosis is poor; the reported survival rate is 10% to 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The direct cause of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> is the formation of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> with the trachea subsequent to arterial injury by the tracheostomy tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endo-tracheal factors are movement of the tracheostomy tube due to body movement and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, pressure exerted by the cuff of the tracheostomy tube, tracheostomy at lower levels, and the fragility of blood vessels and the trachea due to steroid or radiation therapy, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extra-tracheal factors include prior surgery and deformity and shifting of the trachea and major blood vessels due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0008453'>congenital kyphoscoliosis</z:hpo> or thoracic deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There has been no report of the usefulness of contrast-enhanced computed tomography studies to identify the anatomical relationship between the trachea and brachiocephalic artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: A 27-year-old Mongolian woman with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> who underwent tracheal intubation for airway management due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> and granulation development developed a tracheo-brachiocephalic artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> during the placement of the tracheostomy tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was diagnosed by contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography and repaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>About a month later she developed massive airway <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> during replacement of the tracheostomy tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Temporary hemostasis was achieved by compression via cuff inflation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography scan demonstrated a narrowed brachiocephalic artery running along and ventral to the tube and a tracheo-brachiocephalic artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> was suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>She underwent brachiocephalic artery resection and aorta, right common carotid artery, and subclavian artery bypass surgery with an innominate vein, tracheoplasty, and partial sternectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We noted marked thoracic deformity; the brachiocephalic artery was compressed by the trachea and chest wall resulting in localized wall <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and the development of a tracheo-brachiocephalic artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>, a fatal complication whose prevention is important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that before tracheostomy, the anatomic relationship between the trachea and brachiocephalic artery must be confirmed by contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography scan </plain></SENT>
