<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, the most characteristic finding in the CT scan was a low density area in the white matter, seen in 14 (56%) out of 25 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Duchenne <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath>, slight <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> was observed in 20 (67%) out of 30 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was interesting that in the case of Duchenne <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> the older the patient, the more severe were the CT findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> half the patients with a low density area showed a spike or a spike-and-wave complex in the electroencephalogram, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic atrophy</z:hpo> was evident in several cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> is not only a myogenic disorder but also one which affects the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
