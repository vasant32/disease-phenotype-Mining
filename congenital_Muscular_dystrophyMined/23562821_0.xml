<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo>, dystroglycanopathy, is caused by abnormalities in post-translational modifications of dystroglycan (DG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To better understand the pathophysiological roles of DG modification and to establish effective clinical treatment for dystroglycanopathy, we here generated 2 distinct conditional knock-out (cKO) mice for fukutin, the first dystroglycanopathy gene identified for Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first dystroglycanopathy model-myofiber-selective fukutin-cKO (MCK-fukutin-cKO) mice-showed mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forced exercise experiments in presymptomatic MCK-fukutin-cKO mice revealed that myofiber membrane fragility triggered disease manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second dystroglycanopathy model-muscle precursor cell (MPC)-selective cKO (Myf5-fukutin-cKO) mice-exhibited more severe phenotypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using an isolated MPC culture system, we demonstrated, for the first time, that defects in the fukutin-dependent modification of DG lead to impairment of MPC proliferation, differentiation, and <z:mp ids='MP_0000750'>muscle regeneration</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that impaired MPC viability contributes to the pathology of dystroglycanopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since our data suggested that frequent cycles of myofiber degeneration/regeneration accelerate substantial and/or functional loss of MPC, we expected that protection from disease-triggering myofiber degeneration provides therapeutic effects even in mouse models with MPC defects; therefore, we restored fukutin expression in myofibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated rescue of fukutin expression that was limited in myofibers successfully ameliorated the severe pathology even after disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, compared to other gene therapy studies, considerably low AAV titers were associated with therapeutic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Together, our findings indicated that fukutin-deficient dystroglycanopathy is a regeneration-defective disorder, and gene therapy is a feasible treatment for the wide range of dystroglycanopathy even after disease progression </plain></SENT>
