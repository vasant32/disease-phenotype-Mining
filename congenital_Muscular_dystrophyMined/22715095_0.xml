<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A glycosyltransferase that branches O-Man, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase Vb (GnT-Vb), is highly expressed in neural tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To understand the expression and function of GnT-Vb, we studied its expression during neuromorphogenesis and generated GnT-Vb null mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A paralog of GnT-Vb, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GnT-V), is expressed in many tissues and brain, synthesizing N-linked, β1,6-branched <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi>, but its ability to synthesize O-mannosyl-branched <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> is unknown; conversely, although GnT-Vb can synthesize N-linked <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> in vitro, its contribution to their synthesis in vivo is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that deleting both GnT-V and GnT-Vb results in the total loss of both N-linked and O-Man-linked β1,6-branched <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GnT-V null brains lacked N-linked, β1,6-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> but had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of O-Man β1,6-branched structures, showing that GnT-Vb could not compensate for the loss of GnT-V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, GnT-Vb null brains contained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of N-linked β1,6-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> but low levels of some O-Man β1,6-branched <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, GnT-V could partially compensate for GnT-Vb activity in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found no apparent change in α-dystroglycan binding of glycan-specific antibody IIH6C4 or binding to laminin in GnT-Vb null mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that GnT-V is involved in synthesizing branched O-mannosyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> in brain, but the function of these branched O-mannosyl structures is unresolved using mice that lack these glycosyltransferases </plain></SENT>
