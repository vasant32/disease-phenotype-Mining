<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are a few patients who acquire the ability to stand and a small fraction of our total <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) population are able to walk at some point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These ambulant cases may reflect a broad spectrum of motor disabilities in the category of FCMD, or may represent another CMD entity, which closely resembles but is distinct from FCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since the localization of the FCMD gene to chromosome 9q3 1 by Toda et al. in 1993 and 1994, polymorphism analysis of this disease has become possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We describe correlations between clinical features and genetic analysis using microsatellite markers flanking the FCMD locus in two FCMD families each having two affected children with distinctly different motor abilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate that two sets of FCMD siblings share exactly the same haplotype at nine marker loci spanning 23.3 cM, surrounding the FCMD locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results provide genetic confirmation that some FCMD cases may acquire the ability to walk </plain></SENT>
