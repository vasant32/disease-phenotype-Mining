<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We analyzed three Japanese patients (two boys and a girl) from two families with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) and brain involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the two families had two affected siblings of different sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Parental consanguinity was not documented in either family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001290'>generalized hypotonia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> from infancy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>delayed psychomotor development</z:hpo>, facial muscle involvement, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>joint contractures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase levels were markedly elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The histological change seen on muscle biopsy was characteristic of a dystrophic process, although dystrophin and merosin staining were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>cerebral white matter abnormalities</z:hpo> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although these clinical, myopathological and neuroradiological findings were typical of Fukuyama-type CMD (FCMD), full mutational analysis of the fukutin gene revealed neither a 3 kb insertion (Japanese <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutation) nor point mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR analysis of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> isolated from lymphoblasts of a patient revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> expression of the FCMD transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As classification of CMD should be based on genetic background, our present cases with typical clinical, myopathological and neuroradiological findings of FCMD without mutation of the fukutin gene may represent a new variant (or variants) of CMD that is different from FCMD </plain></SENT>
