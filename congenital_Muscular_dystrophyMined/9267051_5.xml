<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Laminin chains alpha 1, beta 1 and gamma 1, were found in the basement membrane (BM) of blood vessels in both <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> and PNS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, laminin alpha 2 though present in the BM of capillaries in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>, was completely absent from PNS capillaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Laminins alpha 2, beta 1, gamma 1 could be detected in peripheral nerve, in the BM of Schwann cells, which did not contain Laminin alpha 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The possible importance of laminin alpha 2 for myelination in the PNS as well as in the function of the blood-brain barrier in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>, and its potential relevance to the pathology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> associated with deficiency of this laminin chain, is discussed </plain></SENT>
