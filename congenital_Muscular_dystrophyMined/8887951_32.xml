<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A subset of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) are deficient for the extracellular matrix protein, merosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the aetiology of merosin-positive CMD is as yet unknown, abnormalities of other structural muscle-specific proteins are likely to be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The alpha-actinins are actin-binding proteins related to dystrophin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied expression of the skeletal muscle isoforms of alpha-actinin (alpha-actinin-2 and alpha-actinin-3) in muscle biopsies from 12 patients with pure CMD (including one with a merosin abnormality), two with unclassified CMD and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) involvement, and three with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852419,C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four specimens exhibited deficient alpha-actinin-3 staining by immunofluorescence and/or Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one, this pattern may be a secondary consequence of marked type 1 fibre predominance, but the other three biopsies contained abundant type 2 fibres where alpha-actinin-3 is normally expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three alpha-actinin-3-deficient patients had pure CMD and presented in the newborn period with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002804'>arthrogryposis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The fourth had a <z:mp ids='MP_0000752'>dystrophic muscle</z:mp> biopsy and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that deficiency of alpha-actinin-3 may be a marker for a subset of patients with CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It remains to be determined whether the deficiency of alpha-actinin-3 reflects ACTN3 gene mutations or is a secondary phenomenon </plain></SENT>
