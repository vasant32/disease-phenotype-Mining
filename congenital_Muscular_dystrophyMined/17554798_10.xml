<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of mutations on the transportation of the mutant proteins may constitute the underlying mechanisms for the pathogenesis of these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we examined the subcellular localization of mouse and human <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and mutant FKRP proteins in cells and in muscle in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human and mouse FKRPs localize in part of the Golgi apparatus in muscle fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the FKRP gene invariably altered the localization of the protein, leading to endoplasmic reticulum retention within cells and diminished Golgi localization in muscle fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results therefore suggest that an individual missense point mutation can confer at least two independent effects on the protein, causing (1) reduction or loss of the presumed glycosyltransferase activity directly and (2) mislocalization that could further alter the function of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The complexity of the effect of individual missense point mutations may partly explain the wide variation of the FKRP-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
