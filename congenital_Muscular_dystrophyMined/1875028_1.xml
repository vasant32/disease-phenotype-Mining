<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A unique Japanese family with both Fukuyama type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD) and Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD) is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four boys, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> from the sixth generation of the same family, were afflicted with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular diseases</z:e> beginning in early life, three of them presenting the typical phenotype of FCMD and one, that of DMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although DNA analysis by Southern blotting with complementary DNAs representing the whole of the dystrophin coding sequence detected neither gross deletions nor duplications, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting of the biopsied skeletal muscle with an antidystrophin monoclonal antibody (dystrophin test) showed that the approximately 400-kd dystrophin was expressed normally at the sarcoplasmic membrane of the FCMD phenotype patient but was completely absent in the DMD phenotype patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From these results, it was presumed that two different childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo>, FCMD and DMD, coexisted in this family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This unique case illustrates the efficacy of the dystrophin test in the differential diagnosis of the two diseases even when conventional means of diagnosis do not give definite answers and DNA analysis of the dystrophin gene is not informative </plain></SENT>
