<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of FCMD was established by prenatal molecular genetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral lesions</z:e> containing neurites, subpial granular cells and glias, accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo> were found in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Small irregular defects, readily detectable by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6824">methenamine</z:chebi>-silver staining or by immunohistochemical staining for S-100 protein, were observed in the cerebral surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was evident at the areas with the larger defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surface defects were also observed in the cerebellum and brain stem, with brain tissue extruding into the leptomeninges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pyramidal tract was aberrant in the pons and medulla oblongata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The spinal cord appeared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> by light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopic examination revealed an abnormal configuration of the basement membrane and glial cytoplasmic membrane of the brain and spinal cord surfaces, including areas with no detectable defects by light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that abnormalities of the pial-glial barrier, especially the basement membrane and/or basement membrane-related structures, are involved in the genesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
