<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Many patients with classic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> have been found to have partial or total deficiency of the alpha2 chain of laminin 2 (merosin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This deficiency has mostly been studied using only 1 antibody against a fragment of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To characterize the expression of laminin alpha2 in the skeletal muscle of patients with laminin alpha2 deficiency using antibodies against 2 different portions of the protein and to correlate the immunochemical findings with clinical phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 4 patients with total lack of laminin alpha2 and 12 with partial laminin alpha2 deficiency with immunohistochemical techniques and Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used antibodies recognizing an 80-kd fragment toward the C-terminus and a 300-kd fragment toward the amino-terminal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient characteristics examined were functional compromise, magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography of the brain, electromyography, evoked potentials, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 4 patients, immunohistochemical analysis revealed no reactivity to either antibody; in 2 patients, the 300-kd fragment alone was partially expressed; in 2 patients, the 80-kd fragment alone was partially expressed; and in 8 patients, both fragments were partially expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot analysis revealed bands of reduced intensity and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> molecular weight generally corresponding to the immunohistochemical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Absence of both fragments or of one with reduction of the other always produced a severe clinical phenotype, while a milder clinical phenotype was observed when both fragments were partially expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Extent of laminin alpha2 deficiency in most cases correlates with clinical phenotype but not with peripheral and central <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Skin biopsy specimens may reveal laminin alpha2 deficiency in patients who have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> laminin alpha2 levels in muscle biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
