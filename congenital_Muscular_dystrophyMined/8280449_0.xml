<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 15-month-old male, diagnosed as FCMD at 4 months old, revealed progressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000256'>large head</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CT scan and MRI indicated not only <z:hpo ids='HP_0001339'>lissencephaly</z:hpo> II classified by Dobyn, but dilated ventricular system and subarachnoid space, and these findings radiologically resembled those of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure and CSF dynamics monitoring revealed high intracranial pressure and high CSF outflow resistance, indicating a high pressure <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>V-P shunt made the patient improved not only symptomatically, but physiologically (increased CBF and decreased intracranial pressure and CSF outflow resistance) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We concluded that the early diagnosis and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> superimposing the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0683324" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">organic disease</z:e> may prevent secondary damage of the brain, and the intracranial pressure and CSF dynamics monitoring is essential for its diagnosis </plain></SENT>
