<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiac involvement was frequently reported with numerous mutations including C826A and 1364C &gt; A mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The original Tunisian family with LGMD2I included 12 patients sharing the LGMD phenotype and homozygous to the 1486T &gt; A mutation but who did not display any cardiac involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we report the clinical data, cardiac assessment and mutation analysis in four sibs belonging to a second Tunisian LGMD2I family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed the LGMD phenotype, the oldest brother and sister had mild cardiac involvement, whereas two twin sisters displayed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients shared the compound heterozygous 1486T &gt; A, 1364C &gt; A mutation in the FKRP gene suggesting that the association of a compound heterozygous state of mutation responsible for LGMD2I and the MDC1C phenotype could lead to cardiac involvement </plain></SENT>
