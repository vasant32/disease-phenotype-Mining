<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although this disorder is caused by mutations in the fukutin gene, which encodes a protein associated with the hypoglycosylation of α-dystroglycan, the specific functions of fukutin protein are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to being found in muscle and brain, α-dystroglycan is expressed in various other tissues including peripheral nerves, suggesting that deficiencies in fukutin may result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011400'>abnormal myelination</z:hpo> of peripheral nerves due to the aberrant glycosylation of Schwann cell α-dystroglycan </plain></SENT>
