<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of merosin deficiency in cases of unclassified <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and to determine the temporal stability of merosin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> in fixed and stored archival material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using an antibody to human merosin we retrospectively studied 12 cases of undiagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> from our files to determine the prevalence of merosin deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Where fresh muscle was not available, unstained stored cryostat sections or destained archival stored sections were incubated with the merosin antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two of the 12 cases of undiagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> were merosin-deficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No difference in intensity of merosin staining was found between freshly cut cryostat sections and unstained stored cryostat sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the intensity of merosin staining in sections archived for up to 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that 16% of unclassified <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> in our study are due to merosin deficiency and that merosin antigenicity remains intact in archival stored muscle tissue, facilitating retrospective evaluation of patients in whom frozen muscle is not available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this latter observation has not been reported previously </plain></SENT>
