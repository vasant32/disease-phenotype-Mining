<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Tunisia is a North African country of 10 million inhabitants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The native background population is Berber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, throughout its history, Tunisia has been the site of invasions and migratory waves of allogenic populations and ethnic groups such as Phoenicians, Romans, Vandals, Arabs, Ottomans and French </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Like neighbouring and Middle Eastern countries, the Tunisian population shows a relatively high rate of consanguinity and endogamy that favor expression of recessive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> at relatively high rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Many factors could contribute to the recurrence of monogenic morbid trait expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among them, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutations that arise in one ancestral individual and diffuse through generations in isolated communities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We report here on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutations in the Tunisian population by a systematic review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> available data from PubMed, other sources of the scientific literature as well as unpublished data from our research laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified two different classes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The first includes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutations so far reported only among Tunisians that are responsible for 30 genetic diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The second group represents <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> haplotypes described in 51 inherited conditions that occur among Tunisians and are also shared with other North African and Middle Eastern countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Several heavily disabilitating diseases are caused by recessive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>They include, among others, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular diseases</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and spastic paraglegia and also severe genodermatoses such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079294" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">xeroderma</z:e> pigmentosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This report provides informations on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutations for 73 genetic diseases either specific to Tunisians or shared by other populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Taking into account the relatively high number and frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic diseases</z:e> in the region and the limited resources, screening for these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutations should provide a rapid and cost effective tool for molecular diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Indeed, our report should help designing appropriate measures for carrier screening, better evaluation of diseases burden and setting up of preventive measures at the regional level </plain></SENT>
