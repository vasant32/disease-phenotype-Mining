<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated two children who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001270'>delayed motor milestones</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first was a girl who was referred at 20 months because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She walked at 28 months and currently, aged 5 years, is independently mobile but has difficulty rising from the floor or going upstairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second was also a girl who presented at 6 weeks of age with <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Her motor milestones were delayed and she walked at the age of 2 years and 8 months and is currently independently mobile at the age of 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase was elevated and a muscle biopsy showed dystrophic changes in both children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry of the laminin alpha2 chain of merosin was very similar in both cases: using a C-terminal antibody that recognizes an 80 kDa fragment, there was a mild reduction in expression on most fibres, while the staining with another antibody that recognizes a 300 kDa fragment showed a very marked reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutational analysis of the laminin alpha2 chain gene in the first patient showed that one of the two alleles had a de novo single nucleotide deletion at position 5702, causing a frameshift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the other allele, we identified two point mutations present in cis; one was a G--&gt;C transition at position +5 while the second was a T--&gt;C transition at position +6 of the conserved donor splicing consensus sequence of introns 37 and 63, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transcription analysis of the corresponding cDNA region did not show any alternative splicing occurring as a result of these splice site mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these mutations probably affect the splicing efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the second child carried in both alleles the same two splicing consensus sequence mutations found in cis in the first patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data provide further evidence that mutations in the laminin alpha2 chain gene are responsible not only for the severe form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003577'>onset at birth</z:hpo>, but also for milder phenotypes, with later <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, in which the synthesis of a partially functional protein, or of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> protein but in reduced quantity, is possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The finding that these two unrelated patients had the same unusual mutation in common might suggest that this is a relatively commonly allele responsible for partial merosin deficiency in the UK </plain></SENT>
