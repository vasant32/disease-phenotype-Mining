<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently FCMD was localized to chromosome 9q31-33 by linkage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a linkage study in seven Finnish MEB families with 12 affected patients using markers D9S53, D9S58, D9S59 and HXB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The MEB phenotype was not linked to any of the markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A multipoint linkage analysis excluded the entire region harboring FCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We thus conclude that MEB and FCMD are not allelic </plain></SENT>
