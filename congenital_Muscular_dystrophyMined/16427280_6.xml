<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a new fibroblast and lymphoblast based protein O-mannosyl beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 enzymatic assay, which allows rapid and accurate diagnosis of carriers and patients with muscle-eye-brain type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven patients with genetically confirmed muscle-eye-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> were assayed for protein O-mannosyl beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 enzyme activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In three patients and their heterozygous parents, the assays were done on EBV-transformed lymphoblasts, in another three patients they were done on cultured fibroblasts and in the last patient on both fibroblasts and lymphoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cultured fibroblasts and lymphoblasts from the muscle-eye-brain patients showed a highly significant decrease in protein O-mannosyl beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 activity relative to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The residual protein O-mannosyl beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 level in fibroblasts (average 0.11 nmoles/h per mg) was about 13% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ratio of protein O-mannosyl beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 activity to the activity of a glycosyltransferase control (N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1; GnT1) in fibroblasts was on average 0.006 in muscle-eye-brain patients and 0.045 in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average residual protein O-mannosyl beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 level in lymphoblasts was 15% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average ratio of protein O-mannosyl beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1/GnT1 activity was 0.007 in muscle-eye-brain patients, 0.026 in heterozygous carriers and 0.046 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Assay of protein O-mannosyl beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 activity in fibroblasts and lymphoblasts from muscle-eye-brain carriers and patients provides a rapid and relatively simple diagnostic test for this disease and could be used as a screening test in carriers and patients with complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
