<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although laminins containing the alpha4 and alpha5 subunits are expressed in alpha2-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, they may be ineffective substitutes because they bind weakly to cell surfaces and/or because they lack the third arm needed for polymerization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We asked whether linker proteins engineered to bind to deficient laminins that provide such missing activities would promote basement membrane assembly in a Schwann cell model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A chimeric fusion protein (alphaLNNd) that adds a short arm terminus to laminin through the nidogen binding locus was generated and compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath>-ameliorating protein miniagrin (mAgrin) that binds to the laminin coiled-coil dystroglycan and sulfatides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>alphaLNNd was found to mediate laminin binding to collagen IV, to bind to galactosyl sulfatide, and to selectively convert alpha-short arm deletion-mutant laminins LmDeltaalphaLN and LmDeltaalphaLN-L4b into polymerizing laminins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This protein enabled polymerization-deficient laminin but not an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>-deficient laminin lacking LG domains (LmDeltaLG) to assemble an extracellular matrix on Schwann cell surfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>mAgrin, on the other hand, enabled LmDeltaLG to form an extracellular matrix on cell surfaces without increasing accumulation of non-polymerizing laminins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These gain-of-function studies reveal distinct polymerization and anchorage contributions to basement membrane assembly in which the three different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> domains mediate the former, and the LG domains provide primary anchorage with secondary contributions from the alphaLN domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings may be relevant for an understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of laminin deficiency states </plain></SENT>
