<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the characteristic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter abnormalities</z:hpo> of merosin-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were also peripheral demyelinating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> and evoked potential abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unlike classic merosin-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, however, our patient was less hypotonic and weak and was able to achieve independent walking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both by immunohistochemistry and Western blot merosin was shown to be moderately reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By immunostaining the alpha 1 laminin chain was overexpressed and beta 1 laminin chain was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A spectrum of clinical phenotypes is likely to become evident in merosin-deficient patients in relation to the discovery of a range of molecular defects in, and variable expression of, this protein </plain></SENT>
