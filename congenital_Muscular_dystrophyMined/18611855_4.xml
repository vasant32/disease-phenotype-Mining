<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In skeletal muscle, laminin alpha2 chain binds at least two receptor complexes: the dystrophin-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> complex and integrin alpha7beta1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying this disorder, we performed gene expression profiling of laminin alpha2 chain-deficient mouse limb muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of the down-regulated genes encodes a protein called Cib2 (calcium- and integrin-binding protein 2) whose expression and function is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the closely related Cib1 has been reported to bind integrin alphaIIb and may be involved in outside-in-signaling in platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since Cib2 might be a novel integrin alpha7beta1-binding protein in muscle, we have studied Cib2 expression in the developing and adult mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cib2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is mainly expressed in the developing central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and in developing and adult skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In skeletal muscle, Cib2 colocalizes with the integrin alpha7B subunit at the sarcolemma and at the neuromuscular and myotendinous junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, we demonstrate that Cib2 is a calcium-binding protein that interacts with integrin alpha7Bbeta1D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, our data suggest a role for Cib2 as a cytoplasmic effector of integrin alpha7Bbeta1D signaling in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
