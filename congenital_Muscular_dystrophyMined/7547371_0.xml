<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six atypical cases in whom the dystrophin expression was inconsistent with both clinical and morphopathological pattern were selected: one case of Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> in whom dystrophin was partially represented, one case referred for investigation in whom dystrophin was absent, despite the lack of clinico-morphological signs supporting the diagnosis of Duchenne disease, two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> in whom dystrophin was absent and one patient with the same diagnosis in whom dystrophin was present, but quantitatively reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A patient with limb-girdle muscle <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath>, in whom immunohistochemical investigation was necessary for the diagnosis is also reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the immunohistochemical investigation using antidystrophin labelled antibodies of muscle biopsies obtained from patients with various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> is mandatory </plain></SENT>
