<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify the most useful clinical and histologic markers that facilitate early diagnosis in LMNA-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and to assess the usefulness of Western blotting (WB) for lamin A/C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed the clinical and histologic features and WB results of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with laminopathies diagnosed in a research-based diagnostic service over 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (MDCL) (n = 5) and Emery-Dreifuss <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EDMD</z:e>) (n = 5) had distinctive early clinical features, the lack of a suggestive clinical phenotype significantly delayed diagnosis in 2 of 3 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (LGMD) (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, 6 of 20 muscle biopsy samples were considered nondystrophic, which contributed to delays in diagnosis in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neck extensor involvement (<z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo>) was the most consistent clinical sign, present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reduced lamin A/C levels on WB were seen in 5 of 9 patients with laminopathies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Clinical features provide the best clues for diagnosing MDCL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EDMD</z:e> early in the disease, and we urge clinicians to become familiar with those phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>WB for lamin A/C may contribute to diagnosis but requires technical expertise, and results are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in many individuals with LMNA mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because of the survival benefit of early diagnosis and treatment, we recommend that LMNA gene sequencing be performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with undiagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and neck extensor <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with genetically undiagnosed LGMD, and those with suggestive clinical signs and nonspecific histologic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
