<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated nine cases of classical UCMD and recorded the clinical phenotypic characteristics and the histopathological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were eight boys and one girl child with classical features of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo>, prominent proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo>, distal hyperlaxity and prominent calcanei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry for Collagen VI A1 done on seven cases showed total absence of labeling in six while sarcolemmal-specific deficiency was noted in one case confirming the diagnosis of UCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> our patients were noted to have near total absence of major palmar and plantar creases, and instead there were fine mesh-like lines in addition to the soft velvety skin on the palms and soles suggestive of altered collagen arrangements in the skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hitherto, this clinical finding has not been described in UCMD in the English literature </plain></SENT>
