<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report two siblings, an 11-year-old boy and his 7-year-old sister, referred to us with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The boy presented at 22 months with delay in walking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A very <z:hpo ids='HP_0003236'>high serum creatine kinase</z:hpo> (CK) level and a <z:mp ids='MP_0000752'>dystrophic muscle</z:mp> biopsy lead to a diagnosis of Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> prior to the identification of the dystrophin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two years later his sister presented with similar problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> was made when they were shown to have inherited different X-chromosomes and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> expression of dystrophin and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sarcoglycans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their conditions remained static </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recently a slowing of the peripheral motor nerve conduction velocities and T2-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging showed increased signal of the white matter, both of which are features of merosin-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunolabelling using a C-terminal laminin alpha 2 chain antibody showed a reduction in expression, while labelling with another antibody that recognises a 300-kDa fragment showed a very significant reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mutational analysis of the LAMA2 gene showed two mutations: one was a G--&gt;C point mutation at position -1 of intron 28 acceptor splicing site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This mutation induced activation of a cryptic splice at nucleotide 4429 of exon 29 and partial skipping of this exon, with conservation of the open reading frame </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The other was a nonsense mutation due to a C_T transition at position 5525 of the cDNA sequence (exon 37), resulting in a stop codon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data confirm that mutations of the LAMA2 gene that do not completely disrupt the production of the protein can give rise to phenotypes considerably milder than classical merosin-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Partial laminin alpha 2 deficiency should be considered in the differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
