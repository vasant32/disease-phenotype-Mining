<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although previous work identified mutations in the o-mannosyl transferase, POMT1, in 6 out of 30 WWS families [Beltran-Valero de Bernabe et al., 2002], the incidence of POMT1 mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sequenced the entire coding region of POMT1 in 30 consecutive, unselected patients with classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two novel heterozygous mutations were found in two patients from non-consanguineous parents, whereas 28 other patients failed to show any POMT1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient was found to be heterozygous for a transition, g.1233T &gt; A, which predicts p.Y352X </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A second patient was found also to be heterozygous for a transition g.1790C &gt; G, which predicts p.S537R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As an additional determination of the frequency of the POMT1 mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e>, we tested for linkage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> to POMT1 in six consanguineous families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> six demonstrated heterozygosity and negative LOD scores at the POMT1 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From these data we show that POMT1 is an uncommon cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e>, the incidence of coding region mutations in this population of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> being less than 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that while the incidence of POMT1 mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> can be as high as 20% as reported by Beltran-Valero de Bernabe et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>[2002] and it can be as low as approximately 7%, as reported here </plain></SENT>
