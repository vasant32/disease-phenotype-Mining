<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown α-DG to be post-translationally modified by both O-GalNAc- and O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi>-initiated glycan structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in defined or putative glycosyltransferase genes involved in O-mannosylation are associated with a loss of ligand-binding activity of α-DG and are causal for various forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we sought to perform glycomic analysis on brain O-linked glycan structures released from proteins of three different knock-out mouse models associated with O-mannosylation (POMGnT1, LARGE (Myd), and DAG1(-/-)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using mass spectrometry approaches, we were able to identify nine O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi>-initiated and 25 O-GalNAc-initiated glycan structures in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermate control mouse brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Through our analysis, we were able to confirm that POMGnT1 is essential for the extension of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> observed O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> glycan structures with β1,2-linked GlcNAc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Loss of LARGE expression in the Myd mouse had no observable effect on the O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi>-initiated glycan structures characterized here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we also determined that similar amounts of O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi>-initiated glycan structures are present on brain proteins from α-DG-lacking mice (DAG1) compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, indicating that there must be additional proteins that are O-mannosylated in the mammalian brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings illustrate that classical β1,2-elongation and β1,6-GlcNAc branching of O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> glycan structures are dependent upon the POMGnT1 enzyme and that O-mannosylation is not limited solely to α-DG in the brain </plain></SENT>
