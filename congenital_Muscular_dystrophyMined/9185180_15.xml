<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Approximately half the cases of classical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) have a pronounced deficiency or absence of the laminin alpha 2 chain of laminin-2 (merosin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is caused by mutations in the LAMA2 gene that codes for laminin alpha 2, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> informative cases so far studied show linkage to the appropriate region on chromosome 6q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most CMD patients with a deficiency of laminin alpha 2 have a severe phenotype that involves skeletal muscle, and the central and peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have identified four cases that have minimal reduction of laminin alpha 2 using a commercial antibody that only recognises a C-terminal 80 kDa fragment, but show a pronounced reduction using an antibody to the 300 kDa fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis is compatible with linkage to the LAMA2 locus in three informative families, whilst the fourth family was not informative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of the affected children are ambulant and have a mild phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The third case is unusual in having severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> but does not show the white matter changes on magnetic resonance imaging of the brain that is usually seen in merosin-deficient cases of CMD; the fourth case has a severe phenotype, typical of merosin-deficient patients but shows good immunolabelling of the 80 kDa fragment of laminin alpha 2, corresponding to the C-terminal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data show that there is a broad spectrum of phenotype and protein expression associated with a primary deficiency in laminin alpha 2, and that a wider range of clinical cases need to be screened for a deficiency of merosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is also important to study the expression of laminin alpha 2 with more than one antibody </plain></SENT>
