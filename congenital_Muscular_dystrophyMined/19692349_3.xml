<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The severely debilitating disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>Congenital Muscular Dystrophy</z:hpo> Type 1A (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e>) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding laminin-alpha2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bax-mediated muscle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is a significant contributor to the severe neuromuscular pathology seen in the Lama2-null mouse model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To extend our understanding of pathogenesis due to laminin-alpha2-deficiency, we have now analyzed molecular mechanisms of Bax regulation in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and laminin-alpha2-deficient muscles and cells, including myogenic cells obtained from patients with a clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In mouse myogenic cells, we found that, as in non-muscle cells, Bax co-immunoprecipitated with the multifunctional protein Ku70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, cell permeable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48545">pentapeptides</z:chebi> designed from Ku70, termed Bax-inhibiting <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (BIPs), inhibited <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15738">staurosporine</z:chebi>-induced Bax translocation and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in mouse myogenic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also found that acetylation of Ku70, which can inhibit binding to Bax and can be an indicator of increased susceptibility to cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, was more abundant in Lama2-null than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mouse muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, myotubes formed in culture from human laminin-alpha2-deficient patient myoblasts produced high levels of activated caspase-3 when grown on poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi>, but not when grown on a laminin-alpha2-containing substrate or when treated with BIPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, cytoplasmic Ku70 in human laminin-alpha2-deficient myotubes was both reduced in amount and more highly acetylated than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> myotubes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased susceptibility to cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> thus appears to be an intrinsic property of human laminin-alpha2-deficient myotubes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results identify Ku70 as a regulator of Bax-mediated pathogenesis and a therapeutic target in laminin-alpha2-deficiency </plain></SENT>
