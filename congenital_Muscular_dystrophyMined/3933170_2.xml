<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two unrelated patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002804'>arthrogryposis multiplex congenita</z:hpo> (AMC) who died perinatally, are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In both, postmortem examination revealed an intact <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and striking <z:mp ids='MP_0000752'>dystrophic muscle</z:mp> changes, consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Few similar cases have been reported before, but since the condition is not well known, it seems probable that in the past many have been labeled as mere multiple malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The possibility of an underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026848" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">muscular disorder</z:e>, either primary myopathic or neurogenic should be considered in any patient with early lethal AMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings confirm that the fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002304'>akinesia</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002804'>arthrogryposis</z:hpo> sequence is a nonspecific clinical syndrome resulting from various causes of muscular inactivity in utero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main objective of this report is to provide reasonable guidelines on how to approach the problem of classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We favor a pathogenetic approach, depending upon careful sampling of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and skeletal muscles at autopsy </plain></SENT>
