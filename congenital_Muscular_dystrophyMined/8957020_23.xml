<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ten laminin alpha2-deficient patients were identified by both immunofluorescence and immunoblotting (30% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> patients tested) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three of the laminin alpha2-deficient patients were carrying a diagnosis of infantile <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085655" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polymyositis</z:e> prior to immunostaining studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical features in the 10 merosin-deficient patients were homogeneous, with severe floppiness at birth, delay in achievement of motor milestones, and magnetic resonance imaging findings of white matter changes with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intelligence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 10-kb laminin alpha2-coding sequence was screened for causative mutations by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction/single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis in muscle biopsy specimens from 5 patients, followed by automatic sequencing of aberrant conformers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clear loss-of-function deletion mutations were identified in both alleles of 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Muscle histopathology in this patient showed a striking inflammatory infiltrate of T cells and B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reexamination of biopsy specimens from other laminin alpha2-deficient patients showed minor signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings and the histological and clinical picture suggesting failure of <z:mp ids='MP_0000750'>muscle regeneration</z:mp>, a pathogenesis model for this major subset of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> is proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data show that muscle histopathology showing a neonatal inflammatory process should be considered consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
