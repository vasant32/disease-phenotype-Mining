<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>Congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> type 1A is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> disease that is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the laminin-alpha2 gene, and results in motor nerve and skeletal muscle dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a previous study, we used genetic modifications to show that inappropriate induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was a significant contributor to pathogenesis in a laminin-alpha2-deficient mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> type 1A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To identify a possible pharmacological therapy for laminin-alpha2 deficiency, we designed this study to determine whether treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi>, which are <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi> derivatives reported to have antiapoptotic effects in mammals, would significantly increase lifespan and improve neuromuscular function in laminin-alpha2-deficient mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mice that were homozygous for a targeted, inactivating mutation of the laminin-alpha2 gene were placed into control, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi>-treated, or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi>-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Drug treatment began within 2 weeks of birth, and the progression of disease was followed over time using behavioral, growth, histological, and molecular assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that treatment with either <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> increased the median lifespan of laminin-alpha2-null mice from approximately 32 days to approximately 70 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> improved postnatal growth rate and delayed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of hind-limb <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">Doxycycline</z:chebi>-treated laminin-alpha2-deficient muscles had increased Akt phosphorylation, decreased <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and decreased levels of Bax protein, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling-positive myonuclei, and activated caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">Doxycycline</z:chebi> or other drugs with similar functional profiles may be a possible route to improving neuromuscular dysfunction caused by laminin-alpha2-deficiency </plain></SENT>
