<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studying the impact of these variations on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> metabolism became a central issue to better understand the biological significance of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe here a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004626'>lumbar scoliosis</z:hpo> and respiratory complications in a patient, who died at the age of 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite a poor linkage to any form of CMD, total deficiency of laminin-alpha2 rather suggested the occurrence of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Extensive analysis of LAMA2 gene revealed two novel mutations: a (8007delT) frameshift deletion in exon 57, and a de novo 7nt deletion in intron 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using an ex vivo approach, we provided strong evidence that the intron mutation is responsible for complete exon 17 skipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mutations are in trans and they each generate a nonsense <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> potentially elicited to degradation by NMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We further discuss the impact of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> alterations on the subtle phenotypic discrepancies </plain></SENT>
