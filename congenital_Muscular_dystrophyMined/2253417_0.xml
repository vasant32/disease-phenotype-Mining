<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LCI levels were determined by a two-site immunoradiometric assay method in 25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study included 15 patients with Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD), 8 patients with Fukuyama type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD) and 2 sisters with non-Fukuyama type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (nFCMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured the value of left ventricular fractional shortening (FS) using echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with DMD and FCMD showed moderate or severe skeletal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean values of LCI were significantly higher in patients with DMD (11.0 +/- 8.3 ng/ml, p less than 0.01) and in patients with FCMD (1.6 +/- 1.4 ng/ml, p less than 0.05) than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (0.3 +/- 0.2 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with DMD, LCI level correlated closely with CK level (r = 0.81, p less than 0.01) but not with FS (r = 0.35, n.s.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with FCMD, LCI level correlated significantly with CK level (r = 0.75, p less than 0.05) but not with FS (r = 0.44, n.s.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Close correlation between LCI and CK levels was thought to result from the cross reaction between cardiac LCI and myosin light chains of skeletal muscle in the assay method we used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two siblings with nFCMD showed mild skeletal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A 22-year-old sister with mild left ventricular dysfunction (FS = 0.41) showed high level of CK (4794/U/L) and mild elevation of LCI (7.3 ngml).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
