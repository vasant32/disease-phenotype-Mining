<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have characterised the expression of the syntrophins (alpha-, beta1-, and beta2-) and alpha-dystrobrevin by immunohistochemistry in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human muscle and in biopsies from 162 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> of unknown aetiology (with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> staining for dystrophin and other dystrophin-associated proteins) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unlike mice, beta2-syntrophin is expressed at the sarcolemma in post-natal human skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Deficiency of alpha-dystrobrevin +/- beta2-syntrophin was present in 16/162 (10%) patients, compared to age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003577'>congenital-onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, although there was variability in clinical severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two major clinical patterns emerged: patients with deficiency of beta2-syntrophin and alpha-dystrobrevin presented with severe congenital <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and died in the first year of life, and two patients with deficiency of alpha-dystrobrevin had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> with complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0000544'>external ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have sequenced the coding regions of alpha-dystrobrevin and beta2-syntrophin in these patients, and identified a new isoform of dystrobrevin, but have not identified any mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that disease causing mutations occur outside the coding region of these genes, in gene(s) encoding other components of the syntrophin-dystrobrevin subcomplex, or in gene(s) responsible for their post-translational modification and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> localisation </plain></SENT>
