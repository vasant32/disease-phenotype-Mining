<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was a Japanese man aged 26 years at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He had shown severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>psychomotor retardation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> since early infancy, and was diagnosed as having FCMD at the age of 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main neuropathological finding was extensive cerebral and cerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo>, characteristic of this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, degeneration of the cerebellar efferent pathway, including the dentate nucleus, superior cerebellar peduncle, and red nucleus, and that of the lateral thalamic nucleus were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest the possibility that the long survival can clarify the latent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> in the cerebellum and thalamus in FCMD, in addition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformations</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The system degeneration should be carefully evaluated in the pathological examination of this disorder </plain></SENT>
