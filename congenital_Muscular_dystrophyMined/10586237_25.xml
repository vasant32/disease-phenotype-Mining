<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An important component of Schwann cell basal lamina is laminin--predominantly laminins 2 and 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the alpha 2 chain common to these two isoforms are associated with dysmyelination in mouse (dy) and man (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, laminin 2 and 4 receptors are also likely to be important for myelin formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several laminin 2/4 receptors are detected at the basal lamina surface of myelin-forming Schwann cells, namely, alpha 6 beta 4 and alpha 6 beta 1 integrins and dystroglycan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The evidence linking these receptors to myelination is suggestive, but not conclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genetic studies have not yet confirmed a role for these molecules in myelin formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Natural or targeted inactivation of alpha 6, beta 4, and beta 1 integrins and of dystroglycan have profound effects on other tissues causing embryonic or perinatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> before myelination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, to conditionally inactivate these receptors specifically in myelin-forming Schwann cells, we have constructed and initially characterized a P0-Cre transgene that activates Cre-mediated recombination of loxP-containing genes in peripheral nerve </plain></SENT>
