<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To gain insight into the function of the newly identified collagen VI α5 and α6 chains in human skin, we studied their expression and localization in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and in genetically characterized UCMD and BM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that localization of α5, and to a lesser extent α6, is restricted to the papillary dermis, where the protein mainly colocalizes with collagen fibrils </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In UCMD patients with COL6A1 or COL6A2 mutations, immunolabeling for α5 and α6 was often altered, whereas in a UCMD and in a BM patient, each with a COL6A3 mutation, expression of α5 and α6 was apparently unaffected, suggesting that these chains may substitute for α3, forming α1α2α5 or α1α2α6 heterotrimers </plain></SENT>
