<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>Congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> syndromes are characterized by congenital <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo>, and dystrophic features on muscle biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, these syndromes are often difficult to diagnose precisely because their clinical and pathologic characteristics are not specific and resemble changes in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined muscle biopsies from 20 children with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Disease controls with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophies</z:mpath> or other <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> (n=19) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals (n=15) were studied for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each biopsy we determined (1) numbers of muscle fibers with alkaline phosphatase (AlkP) staining, (2) numbers of acid phosphatase-(AcP) positive cells, (3) dystrophin levels by immunocytochemistry, and (4) the distribution of merosin and laminin-A staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A ratio of AcP:AlkP staining was calculated for each biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (younger than 4 years of age) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> dystrophin, the AcP:AlkP ratio was low (0.09 +/- 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, the AcP:AlkP ratio was 15 times higher (1.6 +/- 0.04, p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The three children with congetial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> syndromes and reduced dystrophin and one child with facioscapulohumeral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> had AcP:AlkP ratios in the range of Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> patients (2.4 +/- 1.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Low Ac:AlkP ratios were related to relative absence of AcP-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Merosin staining was absent in 5 of the 17 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> biopsies tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the 5 children with merosin-negative but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12 with merosin-positive stains walked (p=0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that a pattern of few AcP-positive cells in the setting of numerous AlkP staining muscle fibers has specificity for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> syndromes and provides histopathologic support for the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Reduced merosin in muscle predicts more severe <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and long-term disability </plain></SENT>
