<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using immunocytochemical methods, we examined the intensity and distribution of dystrophin and spectrin immunostaining of skeletal muscles from 51 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) patients including 36 Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD) and 15 non-FCMD (other CMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>17 age-matched <z:hpo ids='HP_0007269'>spinal muscular atrophy</z:hpo> (SMA) and 5 Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD) patient biopsies were studied as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 15 non-FCMD and SMA patients showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> localization of dystrophin at the surface membrane of each muscle fiber which was undetectable in DMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 34 of 36 FCMD patients exhibited an unusual immunostaining pattern with occasional (17-43%; mean = 28) negative or abnormally immunoreacted (partially deficient, fluffy or intense) fibers for dystrophin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dystrophin was absent in 2 of 36 patients having a clinical diagnosis of FCMD, and intragenic deletion of the DMD gene was detected in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spectrin, a membrane cytoskeletal protein related to dystrophin, also showed an increased number of abnormally immunostained fibers in FCMD (25%), but not so high in age-matched DMD (9%) or SMA patient muscle (0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, our results suggested the presence of intrinsic factor(s) that produce abnormality of the plasma membrane of FCMD muscle </plain></SENT>
