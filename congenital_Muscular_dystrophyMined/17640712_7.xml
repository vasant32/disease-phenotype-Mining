<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, however, there has been no study of the expression of dystroglycan in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0279068" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pediatric solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a combination of immunostaining on tissue microarrays and immunoblotting of snap-frozen unfixed tissues, we demonstrate a significant reduction in native alpha dystroglycan expression in pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0006779'>alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> (RMS), embryonal RMS, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> (NBL), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002885'>medulloblastoma</z:hpo>, whereas expression of beta dystroglycan, which is cotranslated with alpha dystroglycan, is largely unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Loss of native alpha dystroglycan expression was significantly more pronounced in stage 4 NBL than in pooled samples of stage 1 and stage 2 NBL, suggesting that loss of native alpha dystroglycan expression increases with advancing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>Neuroblastoma</z:hpo> and RMS samples with reduced expression of native alpha dystroglycan also showed reduced laminin binding in laminin overlay experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of natively glycosylated alpha dystroglycan was not altered in several other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368871" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pediatric tumor</z:e> types when compared with appropriate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data provide the first evidence that alpha dystroglycan glycosylation and laminin binding to alpha dystroglycan are altered in certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0279068" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pediatric solid tumors</z:e> and suggest that aberrant dystroglycan glycosylation may contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell biology in patients with RMS, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002885'>medulloblastoma</z:hpo>, and NBL </plain></SENT>
