<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESCRIPTION: This study was based on clinical, immunohistochemical assessment of muscle tissue and genomic analysis of dermal fibroblasts of a 7 1/2-year old boy and of the DNA of his parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical aspects and differential diagnosis with other disorders are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>COMMENTS: A better knowledge of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> will improve the number of correct diagnoses and open new horizons for the treatment of such diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genetic evaluation of UCMD patients has relevant implications for prognosis and genetic counseling of the family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dissemination of this disorder in the pediatric community is advisable, because of the early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of clinical manifestations and the fact that it is frequently misdiagnosed or not diagnosed at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
