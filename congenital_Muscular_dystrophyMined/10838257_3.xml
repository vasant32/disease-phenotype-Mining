<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the relationship between imaging changes and merosin deficiency we undertook a MRI study in the dy/dy mouse, an animal model for this form of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High resolution in vivo imaging was performed on anaesthetized animals (two homozygous dy/dy mutants and two heterozygous dy/DY controls, aged 2.5 months) in a dedicated 11.7T magnetic resonance imaging scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T(1) and T(2) weighted images were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mice and white matter changes were not seen at a stage of maturity when MRI changes are already very striking in human patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral MRI abnormalities do not appear to be a feature of dy/dy mice, despite the virtual absence of merosin expression in the dy/dy mouse brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Possible causes for this absence of MRI changes, and implications for the pathogenesis of the MRI changes in humans are reviewed </plain></SENT>
