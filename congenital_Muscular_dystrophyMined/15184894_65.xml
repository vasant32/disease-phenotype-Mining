<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> caused by defects in known or putative glycosyltransferases are commonly associated with hypoglycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG) and a marked reduction of its receptor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have investigated changes in the processing and function of alpha-DG resulting from genetic manipulation of LARGE, the putative glycosyltransferase mutated both in Large(myd) mice and in humans with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> 1D (MDC1D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that overexpression of LARGE ameliorates the dystrophic phenotype of Large(myd) mice and induces the synthesis of glycan-enriched alpha-DG with high affinity for extracellular ligands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Notably, LARGE circumvents the alpha-DG glycosylation defect in cells from individuals with genetically distinct types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene transfer of LARGE into the cells of individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> restores alpha-DG receptor function, whereby glycan-enriched alpha-DG coordinates the organization of laminin on the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that modulation of LARGE expression or activity is a viable therapeutic strategy for glycosyltransferase-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
