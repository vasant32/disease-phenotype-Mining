<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified a novel homozygous COL6A1 premature termination mutation in a UCMD patient that causes nonsense-mediated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> decay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Collagen VI microfibrils cannot be detected in muscle or fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The parents are heterozygous carriers of the mutation and their fibroblasts produce reduced amounts of collagen VI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The molecular findings in the parents are analogous to those reported for a heterozygous COL6A1 premature termination mutation that causes Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the parents of our UCMD proband are clinically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proband's brother, also a carrier, has clinical features consistent with a mild collagen VI phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following a request for prenatal diagnosis in a subsequent pregnancy we found the fetus was a heterozygous carrier indicating that it would not be affected with severe UCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>COL6A1 premature termination mutations exhibit variable penetrance necessitating a cautious approach to genetic counselling </plain></SENT>
