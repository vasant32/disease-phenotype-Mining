<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Investigations into both the pathophysiology and therapeutic targets in muscle <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophies</z:mpath> have been hampered by the limited proliferative capacity of human myoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Isolation of reliable and stable immortalized cell lines from patient biopsies is a powerful tool for investigating pathological mechanisms, including those associated with muscle aging, and for developing innovative gene-based, cell-based or pharmacological biotherapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using transduction with both telomerase-expressing and cyclin-dependent kinase 4-expressing vectors, we were able to generate a battery of immortalized human muscle stem-cell lines from patients with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852419,C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The immortalized human cell lines from patients with Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, facioscapulohumeral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, oculopharyngeal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>muscular dystrophy, congenital</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> type 2B had greatly increased proliferative capacity, and maintained their potential to differentiate both in vitro and in vivo after transplantation into regenerating muscle of immunodeficient mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dystrophic cellular models are required as a supplement to animal models to assess cellular mechanisms, such as signaling defects, or to perform high-throughput screening for therapeutic molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These investigations have been conducted for many years on cells derived from animals, and would greatly benefit from having human cell models with prolonged proliferative capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the possibility to assess in vivo the regenerative capacity of these cells extends their potential use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The innovative cellular tools derived from several different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular diseases</z:e> as described in this report will allow investigation of the pathophysiology of these disorders and assessment of new therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
