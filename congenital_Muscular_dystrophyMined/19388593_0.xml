<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In recent years, several deficiencies of proteins from the muscle membrane, extra cellular matrix, sarcomere, muscle cytosol and the nucleus have been described to cause CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The occidental type of CMD (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e>) in which the primary defect is a deficiency in laminin alpha2 chain (merosin) encoded by LAMA2 gene, accounts for 30-40% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical course of CMD with complete laminin alpha2 chain deficiency may be variable but most often; severe forms characterized by <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> at birth, profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo>, marked delay in motor milestones are observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since the identification of the first LAMA2 gene mutations leading to merosin deficiency in 1995, several mutations have subsequently been reported in many exons of this gene without any "hotspot" region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this work, we report two novel homozygous mutations c.8005delT and c.8244+1G&gt;A in the LAMA2 gene in four Tunisian patients with a severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> phenotype belonging to two unrelated consanguineous families </plain></SENT>
