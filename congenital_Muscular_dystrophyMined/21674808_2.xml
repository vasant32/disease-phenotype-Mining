<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies in mouse models have shown that transgenic expression of a designed, miniaturized form of the extracellular matrix molecule agrin ('mini-agrin') or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> inhibition by either overexpression of Bcl2 or application of the pharmacological substance omigapil can ameliorate the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we tested whether mini-agrin and anti-apoptotic agents act on different pathways and thus exert additive benefits in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> mouse models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By combining mini-agrin with either transgenic Bcl2 expression or oral omigapil application, we show that the ameliorating effect of mini-agrin, which acts by restoring the mechanical stability of muscle fibres and, thereby, reduces muscle fibre breakdown and concomitant <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, is complemented by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> inhibitors, which prevent the loss of muscle fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment of mice with both agents results in improved <z:mp ids='MP_0000750'>muscle regeneration</z:mp> and increased force </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results show that the combination of mini-agrin and anti-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> treatment has beneficial effects that are significantly bigger than the individual treatments and suggest that such a strategy might also be applicable to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
