<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report 51 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> and examine the relationship between degree of merosin expression, genotype and clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients had absence of merosin and 13 showed some residual merosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared to the residual merosin group, patients with absent merosin had an earlier presentation (&lt;7days) (P=0.0073), were more likely to lack independent ambulation (P=0.0215), or require enteral feeding (P=0.0099) and ventilatory support (P=0.0354) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified 33 novel LAMA2 mutations; these were distributed throughout the gene in patients with absent merosin, with minor clusters in exon 27, 14, 25 and 26 (55% of mutations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with residual merosin often carried at least one splice site mutation and less frequently frameshift mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This large study identified novel LAMA2 mutations and highlights the role of immunohistochemical studies for merosin status in predicting clinical severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> </plain></SENT>
