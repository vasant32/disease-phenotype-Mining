<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fukutin is involved in basement membrane formation via the glycosylation of α-dystroglycan (α-DG), and hypoglycosylation of α-DG provokes the muscular, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> and eye lesions of FCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Astrocytes play an important role in the pathogenesis of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> lesions, but the post-transcriptional regulation of fukutin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> has not been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the characteristics of fukutin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> using an <z:hpo ids='HP_0009592'>astrocytoma</z:hpo> cell line that expresses fukutin and glycosylated α-DG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The glycosylation of α-DG was considered to be increased by over-expression of fukutin and decreased by knockdown of fukutin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of Musashi-1, one of the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-binding proteins involved in the regulation of neuronal differentiation, induced a decrease in fukutin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation and ELISA-based <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-binding assay demonstrated possible binding between fukutin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and Musashi-1 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A relationship between fukutin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and vimentin protein was also proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization for fukutin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> showed a positive cytoplasmic reaction including cytoplasmic processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From these results, fukutin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is suggested to be a localized <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> up-regulated by Musashi-1 and to be a component of a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>-protein complex which includes Musashi-1 and (presumably) vimentin proteins </plain></SENT>
