<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in FKTN are now being described in an increasing number of non-Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a Portuguese child with FCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was supported by clinical, histological, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and genetic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genetic analysis of FKTN by Multiplex Ligation Probe Amplification (MLPA) revealed a homozygous duplication from exon 4 to exon 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This in-frame duplication was confirmed by cDNA analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge this is the first report of a FCMD case caused by an intragenic gross exonic duplication in the FKTN gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This report widens the clinical and mutational spectrum in FCMD and corroborates the importance of screening for large deletions and duplications in CMD patients </plain></SENT>
