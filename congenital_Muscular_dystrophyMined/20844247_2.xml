<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the functional defects in slow- and fast-twitch muscles of glycosylation-deficient Large(myd) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While a partial alteration in glycosylation of dystroglycan in heterozygous Large(myd/+) mice was not sufficient to alter muscle function, homozygous Large(myd/myd) mice demonstrated a marked reduction in specific force in both soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although EDL muscles from Large(myd/myd) mice were highly susceptible to lengthening contraction-induced injury, Large(myd/myd) soleus muscles surprisingly showed no greater force deficit compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> soleus muscles even after five lengthening contractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite no <z:mp ids='MP_0005165'>increased susceptibility to injury</z:mp>, Large(myd/myd) soleus muscles showed loss of dystroglycan glycosylation and laminin binding activity and dystrophic pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we show that soleus muscles have a markedly higher sarcolemma expression of β(1)-containing integrins compared with EDL and gastrocnemius muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we conclude that β(1)-containing integrins play an important role as matrix receptors in protecting muscles containing slow-twitch fibers from contraction-induced injury in the absence of dystroglycan function, and that contraction-induced injury appears to be a separable phenotype from the dystrophic pathology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
