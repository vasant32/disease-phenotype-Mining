<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the LMNA gene, which encodes nuclear lamins A and C, underlie both Emery-Dreifuss <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMD2</z:e>) and Dunnigan-type familial partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0009125'>lipodystrophy</z:hpo> (FPLD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This indicates that one gene can cause different phenotypes characterized by tissue degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The gene for one form of Berardinelli-Seip-type congenital total <z:hpo ids='HP_0009125'>lipodystrophy</z:hpo> (BSCL) has been mapped to chromosome 9q34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on the observation that one gene caused both FPLD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMD2</z:e>, we considered that a known gene for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> at or near the BSCL locus on chromosome 9q would be an appropriate candidate for BSCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The gene encoding fukutin, which is mutated in Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> has been mapped to 9q31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We thus developed amplification primers for the coding regions of the fukutin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found no putative disease mutations, but through screening of diseased and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, we identified three novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that mutations in fukutin are not present in subjects with BSCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the identification of SNPs provides tools to investigate this protein for association with <z:mp ids='MP_0005395'>other phenotypes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
