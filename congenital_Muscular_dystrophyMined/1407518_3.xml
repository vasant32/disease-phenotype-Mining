<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initial MRI revealed diffuse abnormal signal in the cerebral white matter extending peripherally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On follow-up studies, the abnormal signals disappeared or decreased from the posterior to anterior, and from central to peripheral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These changes in signal intensity correlate well with the process of myelination as demonstrated in histochemical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It appears that the abnormal signals in FCMD are caused by delayed myelination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When abnormal signal intensity is seen in the cerebral white matter of a developmentally delayed infant, serial MRI may be used to follow the course of the illness </plain></SENT>
