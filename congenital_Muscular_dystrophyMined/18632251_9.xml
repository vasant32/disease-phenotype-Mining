<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have identified the zebrafish orthologues of the seven known genes in this pathway and examined their expression during embryonic development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Zebrafish Large, POMT1, POMT2, POMGnT1, Fukutin, and FKRP show in situ hybridization patterns similar to those of dystroglycan, with broad expression throughout early development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By 30 h postfertilization (hpf), transcripts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these genes are most prominent in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>, eye, and muscle, tissues that are predominantly affected in the dystroglycanopathies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Large2 expression is more restricted and by 30 hpf is confined to the lens, cerebellum, and pronephric duct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show that the monoclonal antibody IIH6, which recognizes a glycoform of dystroglycan, also detects the zebrafish protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Injection of morpholino oligonucleotides against zebrafish Large2 resulted in loss of IIH6 immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the dystroglycan glycosylation pathway is conserved in zebrafish and suggest this organism is likely to be a useful model system for functional studies </plain></SENT>
