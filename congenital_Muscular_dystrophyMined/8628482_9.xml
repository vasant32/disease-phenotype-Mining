<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Merosin, the laminin isoform that contains the alpha 2 heavy chain, was absent in muscle fibers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients by immunohistochemistry and by immunoblot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By electron microscopy, we found a severe disruption of muscle fiber basal lamina, but not of blood vessel basal lamina, which contains the laminin alpha 1 heavy chain isoform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This disruption may play a key role in the degeneration of muscle fibers and in the abnormal proliferation of connective tissue seen in CMD </plain></SENT>
