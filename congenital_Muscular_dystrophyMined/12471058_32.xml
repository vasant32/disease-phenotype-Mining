<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD), Fukuyama CMD and CMD type 1C (MDC1C) are caused by mutations in the genes encoding two putative glycosyltransferases, fukutin and fukutin-related protein (FKRP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additionally, mutations in the FKRP gene also cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> type 2I (LGMD2I), a considerably milder allelic variant than MDC1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these diseases are associated with secondary changes in muscle alpha-dystroglycan expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the function of FKRP and fukutin and examine the effects of MDC1C patient mutations, we have determined the mechanism for the subcellular location of each protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FKRP and fukutin are targeted to the medial-Golgi apparatus through their N-termini and transmembrane domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of FKRP in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> cells alters the post-translational processing of alpha- and beta-dystroglycan inhibiting maturation of the two isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the DxD motif in the putative active site of the protein or in the Golgi-targeting sequence, which cause FKRP to be inefficiently trafficked to the Golgi apparatus, did not alter dystroglycan processing in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The P448L mutation in FKRP that causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> changes a conserved amino acid resulting in the mislocalization of the mutant protein in the cell that is unable to alter dystroglycan processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data show that FKRP and fukutin are Golgi-resident proteins and that FKRP is required for the post-translational modification of dystroglycan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aberrant processing of dystroglycan caused by a mislocalized FKRP mutant could be a novel mechanism that causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
