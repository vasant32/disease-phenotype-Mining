<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compare them to 48 other previously reported similar cases and designate them as altered myelin radiographic pattern <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD), which is the same as occidental CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compare them to the other presently accepted phenotypes: progressive Fukuyama CMD, Walker-Warburg or cerebral-ocular CMD, and Santavuori or muscle-eye-brain CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the different phenotypes are alleles of the same gene, which regulates or expresses a structural protein required for muscle integrity, myelination, and formation of the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such phenotypic diversity has been established for mutations of Xp21 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
