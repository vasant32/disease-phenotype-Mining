<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To do a genetic study of clinically diagnosed Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD) by means of haplotype analysis, and to study the correlation of genotype and phenotype in FCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six closest available informative markers for each of the mapped FCMD genes were tested in 100 Japanese families with at least one affected patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-seven percent of FCMD-bearing chromosomes had an ancestral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> haplotype(138-192-147-183) and 10 chromosomes had a second <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> haplotype(130-201-157-183) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five(69%) typical, and 20(77%) mild, while 5(19%) severe cases were homozygous for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, 13(25%) typical, 5(19%) mild, and 15(65%) severe cases were heterozygous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight of 10 that were heterozygous for the second <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> haplotype had the severe phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two typical cases with severe brain and ophthalmologic anomalies were also heterozygous for the second <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Homozygosity was associated with the typical and mild phenotypes, while compound heterozygosity was related to the severe phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The value of the second <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> haplotype in predicting disease severity was suggested </plain></SENT>
