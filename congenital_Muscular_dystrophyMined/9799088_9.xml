<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After our initial mapping of the FCMD locus to 9q31-33, we performed linkage disequilibrium analysis, which led us to suspect that the FCMD gene lay within a region of less than 100 kb containing D9S2107 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we developed two new microsatellites (D9S2170 and D9S2171) in close vicinity to D9S2107 and examined haplotypes of FCMD chromosomes by using four markers (cen-D9S2105-D9S2170-D9S2171-D9S2107-tel) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As 82% of the FCMD chromosomes that we examined shared the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> haplotype (138-192-147-183) and 94% of the FCMD patients in our panel carried <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> haplotypes on one or both chromosomes, the data supported the hypothesis of a single <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> of this disease in the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight haplotypes different from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e>'s were observed in FCMD chromosomes, indicating that eight different FCMD mutations in addition to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e>'s have occurred in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we have detected several historical recombinations that have disrupted the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> haplotype at D9S2105 or D9S2170 and conclude that the FCMD gene is probably located just centromeric to D9S2170 </plain></SENT>
