<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present our experience of 46 children with CMS, referred to us between 1992-2007 with provisional diagnoses of congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (22/46), CMS or limb-girdle <z:hpo ids='HP_0003473'>myasthenia</z:hpo> (9/46), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011398'>central hypotonia</z:hpo> or neurometabolic disease (5/46), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003473'>myasthenia</z:hpo> gravis (4/46), limb-girdle or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (4/46) and SMA (2/46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was often considerably delayed (up to 18y4 m), despite the early symptoms in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic clues in the neonates were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011968'>feeding difficulties</z:hpo> (29/46), <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0003690'>limb weakness</z:hpo> (21/46), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>ptosis</z:hpo> (19/46), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory insufficiency</z:hpo> (12/46), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo> (4/46) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010307'>stridor</z:hpo> (6/46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five children had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001270'>delayed motor milestones</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>Fatigability</z:mp> developed in 43 and a variable degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>ptosis</z:hpo> was eventually present in 40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over the period of the study, the mainstay of EMG diagnosis evolved from repetitive nerve stimulation to stimulation single fibre EMG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients were studied by several different operators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>66 EMGs were performed in 40 children, 29 showed a neuromuscular junction abnormality, 7 were myopathic, 2 had possible neurogenic changes and 28 were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A repetitive CMAP was detected in only one of seven children with a COLQ mutation and neither of the two children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393934" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Slow Channel Syndrome</z:e> mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mutations have been identified so far in 32/46 children: 10 RAPSN, 7 COLQ, 6 CHRNE, 7 DOK7, 1 CHRNA1 and 1 CHAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>24 of 25 muscle biopsies showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathic changes</z:hpo> with fibre size variation; 14 had type-1 fibre predominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three cases showed small type-1 fibres resembling fibre type disproportion, and four showed core-like lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No specific myopathic features were associated with any of the genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Twenty children responded to Pyridostigmine treatment alone, 11 to Pyridostigmine with either 3, 4 DAP or Ephedrine and five to Ephedrine alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Twenty one children required <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> respiratory support, with tracheostomy in 4 and nocturnal or emergency non-invasive ventilation in 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Eight children had gastrostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Another 11 were underweight for height indicative of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001508'>failure to thrive</z:hpo> and required dietetic input </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>A high index of clinical suspicion, repeat EMG by an experienced electromyographer and, if necessary, a therapeutic trial of Pyridostigmine facilitates the diagnosis of CMS with subsequent molecular genetic confirmation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This guides rational therapy and multidisciplinary management, which may be crucial for survival, particularly in pedigrees where previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> have occurred in infancy </plain></SENT>
