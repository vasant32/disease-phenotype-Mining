<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in six genes involved in the glycosylation of รก-dystroglycan (POMT1, POMT2, POMGNT1, FCMD, FKRP and LARGE) have been identified in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> patients, but account for only a portion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, we reached a molecular diagnosis for 40% of our patients and found mutations in POMT1, POMT2, FCMD and FKRP, many of which were novel alleles, but no mutations in POMGNT1 or LARGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Notably, the FCMD gene was a more common cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> than previously expected in the European/American subset of our cohort, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Ashkenazi Jewish cases, who carried the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutation </plain></SENT>
