<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to establish the natural evolution of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> alterations in this type of CMD, the cerebral functions of 12 cases were examined longitudinally for a mean period of 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 7 boys and 5 girls, with a mean age of 5 years at first evaluation and 13 at the last one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Merosin expression in muscle fiber basement membrane, evaluated in 10 of them, was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 6 and deficient in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> conditions were followed up by repeated neuropsychiatric examinations, intelligence tests, EEG and brain CT scan and/or MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 12 patients (including the 4 with merosin-deficiency) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intelligence, while 4 had mild to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002342'>moderate mental retardation</z:hpo>: in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the intellectual ability was unchanged during the follow-up study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CT scan detected minor brain alterations in 9 patients: 6 of these, the 4 with merosin deficiency and 2 others in whom merosin was not evaluated, presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo>: on neuroimaging reappraisal it was unchanged in 3, improved in 2 and worse in 1 (a merosin-deficient case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebellar alterations or mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> were detected in 8 cases, including 3 merosin-non-deficient ones: these abnormalities were unchanged at the last study by CT and MRI, as were the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neuroimaging findings observed in 3 other cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, during our study the brain alterations found in classical CMD showed a stationary or an improving course; progressive worsening was observed only in 1 of 4 merosin-deficient cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
