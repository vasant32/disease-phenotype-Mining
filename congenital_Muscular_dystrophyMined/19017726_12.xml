<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Hypoglycosylation and reduced laminin-binding activity of alpha-dystroglycan are common characteristics of dystroglycanopathy, which is a group of congenital and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fukuyama-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD), caused by a mutation in the fukutin gene, is a severe form of dystroglycanopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrotransposal insertion in fukutin is seen in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of FCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To better understand the molecular pathogenesis of dystroglycanopathies and to explore therapeutic strategies, we generated knock-in mice carrying the retrotransposal insertion in the mouse fukutin ortholog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Knock-in mice exhibited hypoglycosylated alpha-dystroglycan; however, no signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More sensitive methods detected minor levels of intact alpha-dystroglycan, and solid-phase assays determined laminin binding levels to be approximately 50% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, intact alpha-dystroglycan is undetectable in the dystrophic Large(myd) mouse, and laminin-binding activity is markedly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that a small amount of intact alpha-dystroglycan is sufficient to maintain muscle cell integrity in knock-in mice, suggesting that the treatment of dystroglycanopathies might not require the full recovery of glycosylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To examine whether glycosylation defects can be restored in vivo, we performed mouse gene transfer experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transfer of fukutin into knock-in mice restored glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, transfer of LARGE produced laminin-binding forms of alpha-dystroglycan in both knock-in mice and the POMGnT1 mutant mouse, which is another model of dystroglycanopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, these data suggest that even partial restoration of alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation and laminin-binding activity by replacing or augmenting glycosylation-related genes might effectively deter dystroglycanopathy progression and thus provide therapeutic benefits </plain></SENT>
