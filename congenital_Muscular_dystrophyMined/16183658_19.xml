<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To better understand their role in muscle <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, we investigated expression of decorin and biglycan transcripts and protein in muscle of several forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, and also expression of perlecan, an extracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> unrelated to collagen deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD) and LAMA2-mutated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e>) we also quantitated transcript levels of the profibrotic cytokine TGF-beta1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined muscle biopsies from nine DMD patients, aged 2-8 years; 14 BMD (Becker <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>) patients (nine aged 1-5 years; five aged 30-37 years); four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> patients (aged 2-7 years); six dysferlin-deficient patients (aged 19-53 years) with mutation ascertained in two, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> expression of proteins related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb girdle muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> in the others; 10 sarcoglycan-deficient patients: seven with alpha-sarcoglycan mutation, two with beta-sarcoglycan mutation and one with gamma-sarcoglycan mutation (five aged 8-15 years; five aged 26-43 years); and nine children (aged 1-6 years) and 12 adults (aged 16-61 years) suspected of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular disease</z:e>, but who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> muscle on biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biglycan <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels varied in DMD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> depending on the quantitation method, but were upregulated in BMD, sarcoglycanopathies and dysferlinopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Decorin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was significantly downregulated in DMD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e>, whereas TGF-beta1 was significantly upregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Decorin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in paediatric BMD, but upregulated in adult BMD, sarcoglycanopathies and dysferlinopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Perlecan transcript levels were similar to those of age-matched controls in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> disease groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By immunohistochemistry, decorin and biglycan were mainly localized in muscle connective tissue; their presence increased in relation to increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0000752'>dystrophic muscle</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By visual inspection, decorin bands on immunoblot did not differ from those of age-matched controls in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, when the intensity of the bands was quantitated against vimentin and normalized against sarcomeric actin, in DMD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> the ratio of band intensities was significantly lower than in age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Variations in the transcript and protein levels of these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> in different <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> probably reflect the variable disruption of extracellular matrix organization that occurs in these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The significantly lowered decorin levels in DMD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> may be related to the increased TGF-beta1 levels, suggesting a therapeutic role of decorin in these severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophies</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
