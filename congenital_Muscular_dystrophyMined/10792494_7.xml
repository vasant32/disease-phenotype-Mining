<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The laminin alpha2-chain is a component of merosin, a member of the laminin family molecules, which is mainly expressed in the basement membranes of striated muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is known that laminin alpha2 gene (lama2) null mutant mice (dy3k/dy3k) exhibit <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because the laminin alpha2-chain is also expressed in the thymus, the role of merosin in the thymus was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In association with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, CD4+ CD8+ double-positive (DP) thymocytes disappear by apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, while CD4+ CD8- or CD4- CD8+ thymocytes remain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to study the mechanisms leading to the selective <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of DP cells in the absence of merosin, the role of the interaction between very late activation antigen-6 (VLA-6), a candidate merosin ligand in the thymus, and merosin was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The in vitro survival of thymocytes from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice was maintained by the addition of either anti-VLA-6 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or merosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, when the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> thymocytes were cultured on thymic epithelial cell lines, viable DP cell recoveries on <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> epithelial cells were better than on cells from null mutant mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that DP cells are more sensitive to an uncharacterized apoptotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> signal, and that survival is supported by the interaction between VLA-6 and merosin </plain></SENT>
