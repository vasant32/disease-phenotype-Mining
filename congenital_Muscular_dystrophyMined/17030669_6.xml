<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and molecular features of 3 Italian patients with POMGnT1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Case reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: One patient had muscle and brain abnormalities without eye involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients had a classic muscle-eye-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> phenotype with different levels of clinical severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed cortical malformation and posterior fossa involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence for glycosylated alpha-dystroglycan performed on muscle biopsy specimens demonstrated an absent signal in 1 patient and reduced staining in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis identified 5 mutations, 2 of which are novel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This article adds to what is known about the genotype-phenotype correlation and expands our awareness of the clinical spectrum associated with POMGnT1 mutations </plain></SENT>
