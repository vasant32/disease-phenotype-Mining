<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The intensity of <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> deaminase staining did not decrease in BMD with mild pathologic change, but in DMD, FCMD and WH it decreased in parallel with the severity of the pathologic change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The biochemical activity of <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> deaminase did not decrease in muscle with mild pathologic change in patients with DMD and tended to decrease according to the progress of the disease </plain></SENT>
