<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Complex diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> including clinical, bioptical and molecular genetic approaches has been provided in a limited extent in this country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our group of neurologists, pathologists and geneticists has examined approximately 240 patients suspected of having <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo>, mostly coming from Southern and Northern Moravia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were sent to the examination most often from departments of neurology and clinical genetics, and less frequently from departments of internal medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to the final diagnosis, the patients were divided into groups: with dystrophinopathies and carriers of dystrophinopathies (DMD/BMD), merosin deficient form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, and Emery-Dreifuss <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> including the carriers of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some relatives of patients with dystrophinopathies were also examined using the methods of segregation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High proportion of the DMD/BMD patients can be detected by the methods of molecular genetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> using RT PCR and PTT enables the detection of deletions, duplications, and point mutations in dystrophin gene and encompasses a larger diagnostic scope in comparison with examinations of DNA level by the multiplex PCR method from the peripheral blood which enables only deletion detections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotyping of the dystrophin protein plays an important role especially using antibodies against carboxyterminal (DYS2) and rod domain (DYS1) of dystrophin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Deficient sarcolemmal expression of DYS2 and DYS1 reveals unambiguously a pathological dystrophin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, less pronounced deficiencies in dystrophin expression in BMD patients and DMD/BMD carriers may not always be detected in muscle biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this case, it is necessary to supplement the examination by Western blotting and genotype analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The examination of patients with clinically diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> should start with a muscle biopsy which enables the estimation of presence and degree of structural changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Application of antibodies against the components of DGC and emerin may reveal a deficiency in expression of these proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical examination completed by Western blotting leads to the subsequent molecular genetic analysis of DNA or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Secondary deficiencies in expression of other DGC proteins are often revealed in muscle biopsies of dystrophinopathies and this fact must be taken into account in the evaluation of immunohistochemical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There is a possibility of replacement of invasive muscle biopsy by skin biopsy or buccal mucosal smears in cases of merosin and emerin deficiencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Commercially available antibodies against merosin, emerin, calpain and sarcoglycans enable extensive identification and detailed classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Screening of the patients based on the application of methods described and discussed in this report is the task of the forthcoming period </plain></SENT>
