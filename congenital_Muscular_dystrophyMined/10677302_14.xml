<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, characterized by proximal girdle <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003720'>generalized muscle hypertrophy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> of the spine, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo> of the tendo Achilles, in a consanguineous family from the United Arab Emirates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002878'>Early respiratory failure</z:hpo> resulting from severe diaphragmatic involvement was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intellect and the results of brain imaging were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase levels were grossly elevated, and muscle-biopsy samples showed dystrophic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of the laminin-alpha2 chain of merosin was reduced on several fibers, but linkage analysis excluded the LAMA2 locus on chromosome 6q22-23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the results of genomewide linkage analysis of this family, by use of homozygosity mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four affected children, an identical homozygous region was identified on chromosome 1q42, spanning 6-15 cM between flanking markers D1S2860 and D1S2800 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have identified a second German family with two affected children having similar clinical and histopathological features; they are consistent with linkage to the same locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cumulative LOD score was 3.57 (straight theta=.00) at marker D1S213 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This represents a novel locus for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We suggest calling this disorder "CMD1B." The expression of three functional candidate genes in the CMD1B critical region was investigated, and no detectable changes in their level of expression were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The secondary reduction in laminin-alpha2 chain in these families suggests that the primary genetic defect resides in a gene coding for a protein involved in basal lamina assembly </plain></SENT>
