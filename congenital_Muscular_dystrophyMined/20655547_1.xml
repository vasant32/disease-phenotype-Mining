<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, we examined the expression of TIMP-1 using plasma and biopsied muscle from patients with various <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> by ELISA, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TIMP-1 immunolocalization was also studied in mouse models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma TIMP-1 was elevated and correlated with TGF-β1 in Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD), but not in Becker <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In dystrophic human muscles, TIMP-1 was immunopositive in the regenerating and non-regenerating muscle fibers, and interstitial cells that consist of activated fibroblasts and macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TIMP-1 immunoreactivity was also closely associated with TGF-β1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis showed elevated TIMP-1 protein in muscles in DMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The semiquantitative analysis of TIMP-1 staining intensity and tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> showed that TIMP-1 immunoreactivity is closely associated with the extent of tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in human and mouse <z:mp ids='MP_0000752'>dystrophic muscles</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present study implied that the TGF-β1-TIMP-1 pathway is activated in <z:mp ids='MP_0000752'>dystrophic muscles</z:mp> and the overexpression of TIMP-1 may result in increased deposition of extracellular matrix leading to tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
