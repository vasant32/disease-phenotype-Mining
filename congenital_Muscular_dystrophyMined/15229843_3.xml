<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, mutations in the genes encoding the subunits of collagen VI have been identified in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We undertook two prenatal diagnoses for UCMD in a consanguineous family where the disease was consistent with linkage to the COL6A3 locus and immunolabelling of collagen VI in the proband's skeletal muscle was severely reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Both haplotype analysis and collagen VI immunolabelling were used to determine the status of the fetuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Haplotype analysis of DNA extracted from chorionic villus samples (CVS) from the initial at-risk pregnancy with markers encompassing COL6A3 demonstrated that this fetus had inherited the same haplotypes as the affected child, and immunolabelling of the at-risk CVS demonstrated the virtual absence of collagen VI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A second latter fetus inherited neither of the at-risk haplotypes and collagen VI expression in the CVS was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the second pregnancy, a homozygous G &gt; A change in the last nucleotide of exon 27 of COL6A3 was identified in the proband, substantiating the results obtained from haplotype analysis and collagen VI immunolabelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that haplotype analysis in combination with immunocytochemistry is a rapid and reliable method for prenatal diagnosis of UCMD, provided the family is genetically informative and reduced collagen VI expression in the proband has been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
