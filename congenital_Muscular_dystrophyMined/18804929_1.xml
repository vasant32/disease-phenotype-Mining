<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>delayed psychomotor development</z:hpo> but acquired the ability to walk at the age of 3 years and 10 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>His brain MRI was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No ocular abnormalities were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsied skeletal muscle revealed markedly decreased but still detectable glycosylated forms of alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that mutations in POMT2 can cause a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes as observed in other genes associated with alpha-dystroglycanopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Presence of small amounts of partly glycosylated alpha-DG may have a role in reducing the clinical symptoms of alpha-dystroglycanopathy </plain></SENT>
