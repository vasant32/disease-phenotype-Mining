<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> characteristics of brain abnormalities in Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed 30 MR examinations of 21 patients with FCMD to assess cerebral and cerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo>, white matter changes, and miscellaneous abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had thick and bumpy cortices with shallow sulci corresponding to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002126'>polymicrogyria</z:hpo>, and 12 patients had pachygyric cortices with smooth surfaces, corresponding to <z:hpo ids='HP_0007260'>type II lissencephaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo> had characteristic distributions: the first type involved the frontal lobe in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 21 patients and also the parietotemporal lobe in 6 patients; the second type involved the temporooccipital lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients had prolonged T1 and T2 signal in the white matter, which was indistinct in neonates and seen infrequently in adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In four patients, abnormal vessels were seen within the pachygyric cortices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> studies of the brain show findings consistent with the known characteristics of FCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> detection of the two types of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo> with characteristic distribution and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001317'>cerebellar abnormalities</z:hpo> is helpful in the differential and early diagnosis of FCMD </plain></SENT>
