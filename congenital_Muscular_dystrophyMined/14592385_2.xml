<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper we discuss the following topics from our recent experiences, and their relevance to the assessment of sleep-related phenomena </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(1) 'Post-sigh' <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> appears predominantly during non-REM sleep in control subjects, and is a potential marker of respiratory dysfunction during this stage of sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(2) The disarranged configuration of the arcuate nucleus in Fukuyama-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> may represent a disturbance in the tangential migration pathway in the brainstem, and may be related to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> that is common in this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The maldevelopment of the arcuate nucleus in the victims of sudden infant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e>) may also be related to some abnormality in the differentiation and migration of this neuronal population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(3) The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of hypoglossal nerve activity precedes inspiratory activity of the phrenic nerve, possibly representing a latent drive from the respiratory rhythm generator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These issues are not only related to respiratory rhythmogenesis itself, but are also important in understanding the pathological conditions of arousal responses </plain></SENT>
