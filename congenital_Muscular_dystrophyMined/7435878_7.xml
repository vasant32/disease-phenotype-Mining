<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Light and electron microscopic examinations performed on muscle specimens from 27 cases of clinically typical Fukuyama type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD) revealed the following observations, which had not been documented previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histological and histochemical studies demonstrated that opaque fibers were present frequently in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Very small foci of round cell infiltration were demonstrated in 2 out of 27 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopic study revealed tubular structures which were identical with the ones observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085655" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polymyositis</z:e> in 6 of 27 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were found in the cytoplasm of the endothelial cells of the blood vessels and the histiocytes in the stroma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is widely believed that FCMD is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hereditary disorder</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However the observations mentioned above, particularly the presence of tubular structures in a significant number of the cases suggest the possibility that external factors such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of other inflammatory processes in utero may play an important role in the pathogenesis of some of the CMD cases </plain></SENT>
