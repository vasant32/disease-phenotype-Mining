<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in several known or putative glycosyltransferases cause glycosylation defects in α-dystroglycan (α-DG), an integral component of the dystrophin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hypoglycosylation reduces the ability of α-DG to bind laminin and other extracellular matrix ligands and is responsible for the pathogenesis of an inherited subset of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> known as the dystroglycanopathies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By exome and Sanger sequencing we identified two individuals affected by a dystroglycanopathy with mutations in β-1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 (B3GALNT2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>B3GALNT2 transfers N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28328">galactosamine</z:chebi> (GalNAc) in a β-1,3 linkage to N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">glucosamine</z:chebi> (GlcNAc) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A subsequent study of a separate cohort of individuals identified recessive mutations in four additional cases that were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected by dystroglycanopathy with structural brain involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show that functional dystroglycan glycosylation was reduced in the fibroblasts and muscle (when available) of these individuals via flow cytometry, immunoblotting, and immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>B3GALNT2 localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, and this localization was perturbed by some of the missense mutations identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, knockdown of b3galnt2 in zebrafish recapitulated the human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> phenotype with reduced motility, brain abnormalities, and disordered muscle fibers with evidence of damage to both the myosepta and the sarcolemma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Functional dystroglycan glycosylation was also reduced in the b3galnt2 knockdown zebrafish embryos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Together these results demonstrate a role for B3GALNT2 in the glycosylation of α-DG and show that B3GALNT2 mutations can cause dystroglycanopathy with muscle and brain involvement </plain></SENT>
