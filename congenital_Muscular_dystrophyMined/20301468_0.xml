<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> relies on clinical findings, brain and muscle imaging, muscle biopsy histology (dystrophic features without the hallmarks of the structural changes seen in the congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo>), muscle and/or skin immunohistochemical staining, and molecular genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GENETIC COUNSELING: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> are inherited in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> manner with the exception of collagen VI-deficient CMD which may be inherited in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> or an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> manner and LMNA-related CMD (L-CMD) which is inherited in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> manner with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases to date caused by de novo mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> subtypes, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Carriers are asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the disease-causing mutations in the family are known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> subtypes, the offspring of affected individuals have a 50% chance of being affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The risk to sibs of an individual with an apparently de novo mutation is low, but not zero because of the possibility of germline mosaicism in one of the parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible for families in which the disease-causing mutation has been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Treatment tailored to an individualâ€™s needs is best managed by a multidisciplinary team </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Physical therapy focuses on stretching exercises of the spine and limbs and to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo>, and positive pressure devices or ventilation to promote mobility of the thoracic cage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Splints, braces and surgical intervention are used to prevent and treat spinal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003121'>limb contractures</z:hpo> and deformities; these and other assistive devices may help posture, ambulation, and mobility </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Those with CMD subtypes with central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement require surveillance for possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral problems</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
