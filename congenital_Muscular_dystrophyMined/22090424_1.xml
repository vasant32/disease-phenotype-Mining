<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The LMNA gene encodes lamin A/C intermediate filaments that polymerize beneath the nuclear membrane, and are also found in the nucleoplasm in an uncharacterized assembly state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are thought to have structural functions and regulatory roles in signaling pathways via interaction with transcription factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in LMNA have been involved in numerous inherited human diseases, including severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (L-CMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We created the Lmna(ΔK32) knock-in mouse harboring a L-CMD mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lmna(ΔK32/ΔK32) mice exhibited striated muscle maturation delay and metabolic defects, including reduced adipose tissue and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> leading to premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The level of mutant proteins was markedly lower in Lmna(ΔK32/ΔK32), and while <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> lamin A/C proteins were progressively relocated from nucleoplasmic foci to the nuclear rim during embryonic development, mutant proteins were maintained in nucleoplasmic foci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the liver and during adipocyte differentiation, expression of ΔK32-lamin A/C altered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) transcriptional activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results suggest that lamin A/C relocation at the nuclear lamina seems important for tissue maturation potentially by releasing its inhibitory function on transcriptional factors, including but not restricted to SREBP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>And importantly, L-CMD patients should be investigated for putative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
