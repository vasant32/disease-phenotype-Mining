<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28201">rotenone</z:chebi> in myoblasts from healthy donors and from patients with Ullrich <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (UCMD), a severe muscle disease due to mutations in the genes encoding the extracellular matrix protein collagen VI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28201">rotenone</z:chebi> to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> myoblasts caused a very limited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> depolarization because the membrane potential was maintained by the F1FO synthase, as indicated by full depolarization following the subsequent addition of oligomycin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In UCMD myoblasts <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28201">rotenone</z:chebi> instead caused complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> depolarization, which was followed by faster ATP <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> than in healthy myoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> depolarization could be prevented by treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> and intracellular Ca(2+) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelators</z:chebi>, while it was worsened by depleting Ca(2+) stores with thapsigargin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, in UCMD myoblasts <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28201">rotenone</z:chebi>-induced depolarization is due to opening of the permeability transition pore rather than to inhibition of electron flux as such </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that in UCMD myoblasts the threshold for pore opening is very close to the resting membrane potential, so that even a small depolarization causes permeability transition pore opening and precipitates ATP <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
