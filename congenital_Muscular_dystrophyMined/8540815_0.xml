<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The dystrophin was detected by immunofluorescence in muscle biopsy through a polyclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the cases had patchy interruptions of the fluorescence in the plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A large patchy interruption of the sarcolemma was found in 17 cases, small interruption in 12, and a combination of large and small patchy discontinuity in 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Small gaps around the fiber like a rosary were found in 15 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of these abnormalities ranged cases from: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fibers in 5 cases, frequent in 8, occasional in 5, and rare in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five cases had total absence of immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the dystrophin expression is abnormal in this group of children and that this type of abnormalities can not be differentiated from early Becker <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> nor childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> through immunohystochemistry alone </plain></SENT>
