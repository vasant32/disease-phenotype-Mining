<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A subset of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> have recently been found to be deficient in the extracellular matrix protein merosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consequently, we reviewed the clinical, pathologic, and immunohistochemical features of 12 patients (six males and six females) with classic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> who have been seen at the Children's Hospital, Boston, over the past 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was marked clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> within this patient population, with age of independent ambulation ranging from 13 months to 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemical analysis using antibodies to merosin, dystrophin, 43-kDa dystroglycan, adhalin, and laminin was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 11 of 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient had markedly abnormal staining for merosin; the majority of fibers were negative, although occasional fibers demonstrated patchy staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot analysis in this patient demonstrated markedly reduced levels of merosin (&lt; 10% compared to controls and other patient), of apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinically, this patient could be differentiated from the others by a marked elevation of serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase (&gt; 1000 U/L) and the presence of early white-matter changes on magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of this study support the observation that abnormalities of merosin are present in a subgroup of patients with classic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although marked elevation of serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase and white-matter changes on magnetic resonance imaging may serve to distinguish these patients from other patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, there remains a large proportion of patients in whom the underlying pathogenesis remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
