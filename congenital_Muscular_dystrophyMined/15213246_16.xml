<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The genes responsible for these disorders are fukutin and fukutin-related protein (FKRP), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both gene products are thought to be glycosyltransferases, but their functions have not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we determined their subcellular localizations in cultured skeletal myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FKRP localizes in rough endoplasmic reticulum, while fukutin localizes in the cis-Golgi compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FKRP was also localized in rough endoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle biopsy sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that fukutin and FKRP may be involved at different steps in O-mannosylglycan synthesis of alpha-dystroglycan, and FKRP is most likely involved in the initial step in this synthesis </plain></SENT>
