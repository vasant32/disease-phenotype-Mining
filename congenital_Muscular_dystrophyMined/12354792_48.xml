<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have recently shown that a deletion in the Large gene, encoding a putative glycosyltransferase, is the molecular defect underlying the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026850" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">myodystrophy</z:e> (previously myd; now Large(myd)) mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we show that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> phenotype is not confined to skeletal muscle, but is also present in the heart and tongue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry indicates disruption of the dystrophin-associated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> complex (DGC) in skeletal and cardiac muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantitative western blotting shows a general increase in the expression of DGC proteins and of dysferlin and caveolin-3 in mutant skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the expression of DGC proteins is reduced in cardiac muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overlay assays show loss of laminin binding by alpha-dystroglycan in Large(myd) skeletal and cardiac muscle and in brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also show that the phenotype of Large(myd) mice is not restricted to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, but also includes ophthalmic and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Electroretinograms of homozygous mutant mice show gross abnormalities of b-wave characteristics, indicative of a complex defect in <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The laminar architecture of the cortices of the cerebrum and the cerebellum is disturbed, indicating defective neuronal migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, the phenotype of the Large(myd) mouse shows similarities to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of human muscle eye <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain diseases</z:e> characterized by severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, eye abnormalities and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> neuronal migration defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These diseases include Fukuyama-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and muscle-eye-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e>, both of which are also due to mutations in predicted glycosylation enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the Large(myd) mouse represents an important animal model for studying the function of glycosylation in muscle, brain and retina </plain></SENT>
