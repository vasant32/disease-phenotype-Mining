<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fukutin-related protein (FKRP) was identified as a homolog of fukutin, the defective protein in Fukuyama-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD), that is thought to function as a glycosyltransferase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in FKRP have been linked to a variety of phenotypes including Walker-Warburg syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (LGMD) 2I and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> 1C (MDC1C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Zebrafish are a useful animal model to reveal the mechanism of these diseases caused by mutations in FKRP gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Downregulating FKRP expression in zebrafish by two different morpholinos resulted in embryos which had developmental defects similar to those observed in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> associated with mutations in FKRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The FKRP morphants showed phenotypes involving alterations in somitic structure and muscle fiber organization, as well as defects in developing eye <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, they were found to have a reduction in alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation and a shortened myofiber length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, co-injection of fish or human FKRP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> along with the morpholino restored <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development, alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation and laminin binding activity of alpha-dystroglycan in the morphants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Co-injection of the human FKRP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> containing causative mutations found in human patients of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e>, MDC1C and LGMD2I could not restore their phenotypes significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, these morphant fish having human FKRP mutations showed a wide phenotypic range similar to that seen in humans </plain></SENT>
