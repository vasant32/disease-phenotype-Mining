<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, we identified the gene responsible for FCMD, termed fukutin, through positional cloning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have sequenced 131892 bp of genomic DNA in the region of the fukutin gene on chromosome 9q31 and obtained its complete genomic structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fukutin genomic sequence spans approximately 100 kb and is organized into 10 exons (41-6067 bp) and nine introns (1841-21460 bp) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using these sequence data, we have identified three novel fukutin mutations in FCMD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have also located a putative TATA box in the flanking 5' region and identified numerous alternatively spliced fukutin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of expressed sequence tag clusters within the region revealed two novel genes upstream of the fukutin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data provide fundamental information to support detailed genetic and functional analyses of the fukutin gene </plain></SENT>
