<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the majority of clinical cases are genetically undefined, several causative genes have been identified that encode known or putative glycosyltransferases in the biosynthetic pathway of dystroglycan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we test the effects of brain-specific deletion of dystroglycan, and show distinct functions for neuronal and glial dystroglycan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Deletion of dystroglycan in the whole brain produced glial/neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002282'>heterotopia</z:hpo> resembling the cerebral cortex malformation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0007260'>cobblestone lissencephaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, dystroglycan stabilizes the basement membrane of the glia limitans, thereby supporting the cortical infrastructure necessary for neuronal migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This function depends on extracellular dystroglycan interactions, since the cerebral cortex developed normally in transgenic mice that lack the dystroglycan intracellular domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, forebrain histogenesis was preserved in mice with neuron-specific deletion of dystroglycan, but hippocampal long-term potentiation was blunted, as is also the case in the Largemyd mouse, in which dystroglycan glycosylation is disrupted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings provide genetic evidence that neuronal dystroglycan plays a role in synaptic plasticity and that glial dystroglycan is involved in forebrain development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Differences in dystroglycan glycosylation in distinct cell types of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> may contribute to the diversity of dystroglycan function in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>, as well as to the broad clinical spectrum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0007260'>type II lissencephalies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
