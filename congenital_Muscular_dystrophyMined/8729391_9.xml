<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A selective deficiency of a specific laminin isovariant, merosin made of M, B1 and B2 chains, was found in a series of 17 patients affected with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The merosin deficiency was complete in 15 cases, and almost complete in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An overexpression of the laminin A chain was seen in these biopsies, while B1 and B2 chains were normally expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the clinical data with a series of 18 "merosin-non deficient" cases showed that the "merosin-deficient" cases were forming a more homogenous group than the "non-deficient" one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>Hypotonia</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo>, motor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0424605" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">development delay</z:e> were generally more severe in the "merosin-deficient" series of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter alterations</z:hpo> were seen in most cases explored by MRI or scan imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A genetic linkage with a 6q2 locus, corresponding to the M chain gene localization, was found in a panel of informative families from French and Turkish origin with "merosin deficient" CMD. "Merosin non-deficient" families did not map on this locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>So, the "merosin-deficient" CMD can be considered as a peculiar entity within the group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>Congenital Muscular Dystrophies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
