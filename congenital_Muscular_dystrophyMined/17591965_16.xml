<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that overexpression of the cytotoxic T cell (CT) GalNAc transferase (Galgt2) is effective in inhibiting the development of muscle pathology in the dy(W) mouse model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e>, much as we had previously shown in mdx animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Embryonic overexpression of Galgt2 in skeletal muscles using transgenic mice or postnatal overexpression using adeno-associated virus both reduced the extent of muscle pathology in dy(W)/dy(W) skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As with mdx mice, embryonic overexpression of the Galgt2 transgene in dy(W)/dy(W) myofibers inhibited muscle growth, whereas postnatal overexpression did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both embryonic and postnatal overexpression of Galgt2 in dy(W)/dy(W) muscle increased the expression of agrin, a protein that, in recombinant form, has been shown to ameliorate disease, whereas laminin alpha1, another disease modifier, was not expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Galgt2 over-expression also stimulated the glycosylation of a gly-colipid with the CT carbohydrate, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi> accounted for most of the CT-reactive material in postnatal overexpression experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These experiments demonstrate that Galgt2 overexpression is effective in altering disease progression in skeletal muscles of dy(W) mice and should be considered as a therapeutic target in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> </plain></SENT>
