<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although it has been reported that MCMD reduces acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity of mouse sciatic nerve, no information is available regarding its action on butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Amphiphilic BuChE monomers (G(1)(A), 39%), dimers (G(2)(A), 18%), and tetramers (G(4)(A), 33%), along with hydrophilic tetramers (G(4)(H), 10%), were identified in mouse sciatic nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It also contained abundant G(4)(A) (75%) and less G(1)(A), G(2)(A), G(4)(H) and A(12) AChE components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In dystrophic nerves, the BuChE activity increased 2-fold but the proportion of the G(4)(A) form dropped from 33% to 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AChE activity decreased and the composition of enzyme forms was unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lectin interaction studies showed that, in contrast to skeletal muscle, the defect of merosin did not greatly alter the glycosylation of nerve cholinesterases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The anomalous synthesis of BuChE forms in dystrophic nerve may be related with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> of MCMD </plain></SENT>
