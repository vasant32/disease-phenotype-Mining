<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the unusual pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> and the presence of variable degree of muscle pathology, subtle electrophysiological abnormalities and lack of circadian variability of symptoms may complicate its recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported a Palestinian family with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and linkage to chromosome 4p16.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As the DOK7 gene is located in this genetic interval, we considered it a potential candidate for this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients showed a homozygous DOK7 pathogenic mutation (c.957delC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have re-examined six patients and found permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003325'>limb-girdle weakness</z:hpo>, but also episodic crises without clear precipitating factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following the revised diagnosis, patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2549">salbutamol</z:chebi> for 8 months with significant improvement in their muscle strength and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This family needs to be reclassified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital myasthenic syndrome</z:e> rather than <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
