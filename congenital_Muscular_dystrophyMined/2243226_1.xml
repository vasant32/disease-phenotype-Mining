<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a previous study, we demonstrated by Western blot analysis of the biopsied skeletal muscles using an anti-connectin monoclonal antibody that connectin was degraded extensively after 5 years of age in Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD), while it was degraded mildly in Becker <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and only minimally in myotonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath>, limb girdle <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0007354'>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007959" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the degradation state of connectin in Fukuyama type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD) by a similar method using 2 distinct anti-connectin monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In FCMD, connectin degradation began much earlier than in DMD: Definite degradation was already observed in 5-8-month-old patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was presumed that connectin degradation would play an important role in the myofibrillar degeneration in the early stage of FCMD </plain></SENT>
