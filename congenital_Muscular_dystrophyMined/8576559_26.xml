<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has recently been shown that merosin, a laminin variant, is deficient in a proportion of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Merosin is a heterotrimer composed of the alpha 2, beta 1, and gamma 1 subunits, and further studies have shown that it is the alpha 2 subunit that is deficient in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because the alpha 2 subunit is also expressed in S-merosin, found in Schwann cells, we have investigated whether peripheral nerve function is also affected in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Motor nerve conduction velocities and sensory distal latencies were examined in 25 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and the results correlated with the merosin expression in their muscle biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but two of the 10 merosin-deficient cases had reduced motor nerve conduction, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the merosin-positive cases had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the biopsies of these two cases showed that they produced merosin in reduced amounts, in contrast to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other merosin-deficient patients that produced no or only traces of merosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sensory nerve studies showed no difference between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270922" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">peripheral demyelinating neuropathy</z:e> is a feature of merosin-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The fact that the alpha 2 subunits is also expressed in Schwann cells supports the idea that the alpha 2 gene, located on chromosome 6, is the candidate gene for merosin-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
