<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have studied two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> patients born to non-consanguineous parents, and in both cases, we identified mutations in the fukutin gene responsible for this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One of the patients carries a homozygous-single nucleotide insertion that produces a frameshift, being this the first time that this insertion has been described in homozygosis and causing a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other patient carries two novel mutations, one being a point mutation that produces an amino acid substitution, while the other is a deletion in the 3'UTR that affects the polyadenylation signal of the fukutin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This deletion would probably result in the complete loss of the fukutin transcripts from this allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is the first time a mutation localized outside of the fukutin coding region has been identified as a cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
