<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed immunohistochemistry for collagen VI in muscles from 362 Japanese patients with CMD, and directly sequenced the three collagen VI genes, COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3, in patients found to have collagen VI deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In Japan, primary collagen VI deficiency accounts for 7.2% of congenital muscular deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among these patients, five had complete deficiency (CD) and 29 had sarcolemma-specific collagen VI deficiency (SSCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found two homozygous and three compound heterozygous mutations in COL6A2 and COL6A3 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients with CD, and identified heterozygous missense mutations or in-frame small deletions in 21 patients with SSCD in the triple helical domain (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">THD</z:e>) of COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> mutations in SSCD were <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> dominant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No genotype-phenotype correlation was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Primary collagen VI deficiency is the second most common CMD after Fukuyama type CMD in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dominant mutations located in the N-terminal side from the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32460">cysteine residue</z:chebi> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">THD</z:e> of COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3 are closely associated with SSCD </plain></SENT>
