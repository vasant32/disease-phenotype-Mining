<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Japan, 87% of FCMD-bearing chromosomes carry a 3-kb retrotransposal insertion of tandemly repeated sequences within the disease gene recently identified on chromosome 9q31, and most of them share a common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FCMD is the first human disease known to be caused primarily by an ancient retrotransposal integration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By applying two methods for the study of linkage disequilibrium between flanking polymorphic markers and the disease locus, and of its decay over time, the age of the insertion mutation causing FCMD in Japanese patients is calculated to be approximately 102 generations (95% confidence interval: 86-117 g), or slightly less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The estimated age dates the most recent common ancestor of the mutation-bearing chromosomes back to the time (or a few centuries before) the Yayoi people started migrating to Japan from the Korean peninsula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This finding makes the molecular population genetics of FCMD understandable in the context of Japan's history and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> effect consistent with the prevalent theory on the origins of the modern Japanese population </plain></SENT>
