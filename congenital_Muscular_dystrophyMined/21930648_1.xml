<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The underlying molecular pathomechanism is the hypoglycosylation of α-dystroglycan (α-DG), which is evidenced by diminished immunoreactivity to IIH6C4 and VIA4-1, antibodies that recognize carbohydrate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies indicate that LARGE participates in the formation of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29315">phosphoryl</z:chebi> glycan branch on O-linked <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> or it modifies complex N- and mucin O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we overexpressed LARGE in neural stem cells deficient in protein O-mannosyltransferase 2 (POMT2), an enzyme required for O-mannosyl glycosylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that overexpressing LARGE did not lead to hyperglycosylation of α-DG in POMT2 knockout (KO) cells but did generate IIH6C4 and VIA4-1 immunoreactivity and laminin-binding activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, overexpressing LARGE in cells deficient in both POMT2 and α-DG generated laminin-binding IIH6C4 immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that LARGE expression resulted in the glycosylation of proteins other than α-DG in the absence of O-mannosyl glycosylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The IIH6C4 immunoreactivity generated in double-KO cells was largely removed by treatment either with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> N-glycosidase F or with cold aqueous <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29228">hydrofluoric acid</z:chebi>, suggesting that LARGE expression caused <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29315">phosphoryl</z:chebi> glycosylation of N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the glycosylation of α-DG by LARGE is dependent on POMT2, indicating that LARGE expression only modifies O-linked mannosyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> of α-DG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, LARGE expression mediates the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29315">phosphoryl</z:chebi> glycosylation of not only O-mannosyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> including those on α-DG but also N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> on proteins other than α-DG </plain></SENT>
