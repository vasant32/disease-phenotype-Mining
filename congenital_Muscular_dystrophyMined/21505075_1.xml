<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The most common form of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, Type 1A (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e>), is caused by mutations in the human LAMA2 gene that encodes the laminin-α2 subunit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to skeletal muscle deficits, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> patients typically show a loss of peripheral nerve function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To identify the mechanisms underlying this loss of nerve function, we have examined pathology and cell differentiation in sciatic nerves and ventral roots of the laminin-α2-deficient (Lama2(-/-)) mice, which are models for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that, compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>, sciatic nerves of Lama2(-/-) mice had a significant increase in both proliferating (Ki67+) cells and premyelinating (Oct6+) Schwann cells, but also had a significant decrease in both immature/non-myelinating [glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)(+)] and myelinating (Krox20+) Schwann cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To extend our previous work in which we found that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi>, which has multiple effects on mammalian cells, improves motor behavior and more than doubles the median life-span of Lama2(-/-) mice, we also determined how nerve pathology was affected by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that myelinating (Krox20+) Schwann cells were significantly increased in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi>-treated compared with untreated sciatic nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi>-treated peripheral nerves had significantly less pathology as measured by assays such as amount of unmyelinated or disorganized axons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study thus identified aberrant proliferation and differentiation of Schwann cells as key components of pathogenesis in peripheral nerves and provided proof-of-concept that pharmaceutical therapy can be of potential benefit for peripheral nerve dysfunction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> </plain></SENT>
