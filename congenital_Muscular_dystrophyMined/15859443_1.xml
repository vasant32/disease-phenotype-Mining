<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is no consensus of opinion regarding the continuous infusion of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> in patients with progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We successfully treated 2 patients with progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> who were anesthetized with a continuous infusion of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In case 1, a 19-year-old, 59-kg man with Becker <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> was scheduled for dental treatment under general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>General anesthesia was maintained by a continuous infusion of 6-10 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> per hour and an inhalational mixture of 67% nitrous <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and 33% oxygen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No complications were observed during or after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In case 2, a 5-year-old, 11-kg boy with Fukuyama type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and slight <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> was scheduled for dental treatment under general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>General anesthesia was maintained with a continuous infusion of 6-12 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> per hour and an inhalational mixture of 0.5-1.5% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> in 67% nitrous <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and 33% oxygen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No complications were observed during or after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is speculated that a continuous infusion of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> in progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> does not cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0002047'>malignant hyperthermia</z:hpo> because serum levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> phosphokinase and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="7044">myoglobin</z:chebi> decreased after our <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our observations suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> may have some advantages in patients with progressive type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> other than Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and Becker <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our cases suggest that a continuous infusion of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> for the patients with progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> is a safe component of our <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> strategy </plain></SENT>
