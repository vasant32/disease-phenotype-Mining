<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a critical regulating factor in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> that is known to be induced by hypoxic and/or ischemic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To examine whether VEGF is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, we measured serum levels of VEGF in 52 patients with DMD, 15 with Becker <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (BMD), 20 with Fukuyama <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD), eight with myotonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> (DM), and four with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007269'>spinal muscular atrophy</z:hpo> (SMA), as well as in 15 healthy and eight disease controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The serum level of VEGF in the DMD patients was 267.7+/-25.3 pg/ml (10.5-800.0), while it was 358.8+/-96.3 pg/ml (0.2-1320.0) in the BMD patients, 261.4+/-45.6 pg/ml (0.1-758.0) in the FCMD patients, 165.0+/-63.4 pg/ml (2.6-479.0) in the DM patients, 96.0+/-30.3 pg/ml (41.0-168.0) in the SMA patients, 148.3+/-20.1 pg/ml (46.5-298.0) in the healthy controls, and 154.1+/-54.0 pg/ml (7.2-343.0) in the disease controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The level of VEGF in BMD was significantly elevated, as compared with DM, SMA, and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, the level of VEGF in the bedridden sub-group of DMD patients was significantly elevated as compared with chair-bound DMD, DM, SMA, and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We concluded that VEGF may reflect hypoxic and/or ischemic conditions in muscle tissue, and have a relationship with the process of disease progression in DMD and BMD patients </plain></SENT>
