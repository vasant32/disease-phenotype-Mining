<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Dystroglycan (DG) is a cell surface <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> that connects extracellular matrix molecules to the intracellular cytoskeleton, functioning as mechanical and signaling axes in various physiological events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the ligand binding activity of DG strictly depends on O-mannosyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> attached to its extracellular α-DG subunit, aberrant glycosylation causes dystroglycanopathy, a subclass of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence shows that like-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (LARGE), a glycosyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of a phosphodiester-linked modification on O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi>, is essential for α-DG to gain the ligand binding activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that human natural killer-1 sulfotransferase (HNK-1ST), which was originally reported as one of the enzymes responsible for HNK-1 glyco-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>, had an ability to suppress the glycosylation and function of α-DG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated how HNK-1ST regulates the glycosylation of α-DG using deletion and mutation analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We generated an α-DG mutant which has only one <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32835">threonine residue</z:chebi> capable of being modified by LARGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Focusing on the single post-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29315">phosphoryl</z:chebi> modification site, we found that HNK-1ST showed an almost complete inhibition of the LARGE-dependent modification and transferred a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> group to the phosphodiester-linked moiety on O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, using an in vitro enzymatic assay system, we demonstrated that the sulfated α-DG by HNK-1ST is no longer glycosylated by LARGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results illustrate one possible glycosylation pathway where α-DG function is regulated by opposing actions of HNK-1ST and LARGE </plain></SENT>
