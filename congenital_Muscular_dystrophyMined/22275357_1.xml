<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in fukutin cause abnormal glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, a cell surface laminin receptor; however, the exact function and pathophysiological role of fukutin are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the most prevalent mutation in Japan is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> retrotransposal insertion, point mutations leading to abnormal glycosylation of α-dystroglycan have been reported, both in Japan and elsewhere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To understand better the molecular pathogenesis of fukutin-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo>, we constructed 13 disease-causing missense fukutin mutations and examined their pathological impact on cellular localization and α-dystroglycan glycosylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When expressed in C2C12 myoblast cells, <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> fukutin localizes to the Golgi apparatus, whereas the missense mutants A170E, H172R, H186R, and Y371C instead accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Protein O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> β1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (POMGnT1) also mislocalizes when co-expressed with these missense mutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34892">nocodazole</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48080">brefeldin A</z:chebi> experiments suggested that these mutant proteins were not transported to the Golgi via the anterograde pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found that low temperature culture or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> treatment corrected the subcellular location of these missense mutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression studies using fukutin-null mouse embryonic stem cells showed that the activity responsible for generating the laminin-binding glycan of α-dystroglycan was retained in these mutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Together, our results suggest that some disease-causing missense mutations cause abnormal folding and localization of fukutin protein, and therefore we propose that folding amelioration directed at correcting the cellular localization may provide a therapeutic benefit to glycosylation-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
