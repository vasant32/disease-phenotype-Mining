<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>Congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> type 1A is caused by mutations in the LAMA2 gene that encodes the laminin α2 chain, a component of the skeletal muscle extracellular matrix protein laminin-211 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical spectrum of the disease is more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> than previously thought, particularly in terms of motor achievement and disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated clinical findings and performed molecular genetic analysis in 3 families from Saudi Arabia and 1 from Sudan in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> 1A was suspected based on homozygosity mapping and laminin α2 chain deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated 9 affected individuals from 1 Sudanese and 3 Saudi families in whom <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> was suggested by clinical, neuroimaging and/or pathological findings and by homozygosity mapping at the LAMA2 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morphological and immunohistochemical analysis were performed in 3 patients from the 3 Saudi families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SSCP analysis, DNA sequencing and microsatellite analysis were carried out in the 4 index cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A previously described mutation in the LAMA2 gene, a homozygous T &gt; C substitution at position +2 of the consensus donor splice site of exon 26, was found in the 4 index patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical evaluation of 9 patients from the 4 families revealed variable disease severity particularly as regards motor achievement and disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite analysis showed an identical mutation-associated haplotype in the 4 index cases indicating a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> effect of the mutation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide further evidence that the clinical spectrum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDC1A</z:e> due to a single mutation is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, particularly in terms of motor achievement and disease progression, making it difficult to give a reliable prognosis even in patients with identical LAMA2-associated haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The c.3924 + 2 T &gt; C mutation to date has been found only in patients originating from the Middle East or Sudan; therefore laminin 2 chain deficiency in patients from those regions should initially prompt a search for this mutation </plain></SENT>
