<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There have been occasional cases with structural abnormalities, mainly involving the occipital cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report our brain imaging findings in 14 children with merosin-deficient CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten cases had a severe reduction or absence of merosin on immunocytochemistry and four cases had partial reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 14 cases had white matter changes, which appeared after the first 6 months of life and persisted with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The changes were diffuse and the oldest child scanned (14 years) also showed involvement of the U fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five children with total absence of merosin also had structural abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One child had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002342'>moderate mental retardation</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, mainly characterised by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002384'>complex partial seizures</z:hpo>, with atypical absences, which had been difficult to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI showed marked occipital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001339'>agyria</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007053'>pontocerebellar hypoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The gyral pattern of the rest of the brain looked <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The four other cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intelligence, also had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001321'>cerebellar hypoplasia</z:hpo> with variable involvement of the pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>They did not, however, have neuronal migration defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is recognised that several forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, namely Fukuyama CMD, muscle-eye-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> and Walker-Warburg syndrome, have structural brain abnormalities and associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our cases demonstrate that a range of structural malformations can also be found in a significant number of children with merosin-deficient CMD </plain></SENT>
