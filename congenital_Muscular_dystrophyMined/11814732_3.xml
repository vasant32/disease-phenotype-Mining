<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children, biochemical, neuroradiologic, cardiac, and neurophysiologic studies were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral structures that were myelinated at gestation, including internal capsule, corpus callosum, brainstem, and cerebellar white matter, demonstrated no abnormalities, whereas the periventricular and subcortical white matter, which were myelinated in the first postnatal year, demonstrated signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed an elevated albumin cerebrospinal fluid to serum ratio in the younger children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electroencephalogram results were abnormal in the two elder children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One child suffered from congestive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increase in nerve conduction velocity in these children over the years lagged behind those of healthy patients, pointing to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270922" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">demyelinating neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in merosin-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> patients, nonmuscular involvement includes the central and peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pattern of myelination of the brain and nerve conduction slowing suggests a myelination arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Merosin deficiency can give rise to a congestive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, which is of no clinical relevance in the majority of children </plain></SENT>
