<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Miyoshi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (median <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> 19 years) is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, most marked in the distal parts of the legs, especially the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over a period of years, the <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> spread to the thighs and gluteal muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The forearms may become mildly atrophic with decrease in grip strength; the small muscles of the hands are spared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LGMD2B is characterized by early <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the pelvic and shoulder girdle muscles in adolescence or young adulthood, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slow progression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other phenotypes are scapulo-peroneal syndrome, distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with anterior tibial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, elevated serum CK concentration only, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Diagnosis depends on a combination of muscle biopsy and molecular genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsy Western immunoblotting almost always indicates a primary dysferlinopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Molecular genetic testing of DYSF, the only gene associated with dysferlinopathy, is clinically available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Individualized management may include physical therapy, use of mechanical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e>, surgical intervention for orthopedic complications, respiratory <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e>, and social and emotional support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prevention of secondary complications: stretching exercises to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Surveillance: annual monitoring of muscle strength, joint range of motion, and respiratory function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>GENETIC COUNSELING: Dysferlinopathy is inherited in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Once an at-risk sib is known to be unaffected, the risk of his/her being a carrier is 2/3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the disease-causing mutations in the family are known </plain></SENT>
