<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The fukutin gene (FKTN) is the causative gene for Fukuyama-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, characterized by rather homogeneous clinical features of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle wasting</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> from early infancy with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast with the severe dystrophic involvement of skeletal muscle, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac insufficiency</z:hpo> is quite rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fukuyama-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> is one of the disorders associated with glycosylation defects of alpha-dystroglycan, an indispensable molecule for intra-extra cell membrane linkage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Protein and functional analyses of alpha-dystroglycan and mutation screening of FKTN and other associated genes were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Surprisingly, we identified six patients in four families showing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> with no or minimal limb girdle muscle involvement and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intelligence, associated with a compound heterozygous FKTN mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient died by rapid progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> at 12 years old, and the other patient received cardiac implantation at 18 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Skeletal muscles from the patients showed minimal dystrophic features but have altered glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan and reduced laminin binding ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One cardiac muscle that underwent biopsy showed altered glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan similar to that observed in a Fukuyama-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: FKTN mutations could cause much wider spectrum of clinical features than previously perceived, including familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and mildest <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
