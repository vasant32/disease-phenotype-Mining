<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Extended sequencing of the introns flanking the 64 LAMA2 exons was carried out and, based on these sequences, oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify the coding region of each exon separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By PCR-SSCP analysis, we identified eight new mutations in nine families originating from various countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> induced a premature truncation of the protein, either in the short arm or in the globular C-terminal domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 2 bp deletion in exon 13, 2098delAG, was found in three French non-consanguineous families and a nonsense mutation of exon 20, Cys967stop, in two other non-consanguineous families originating from Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Determination of rare intragenic polymorphisms permitted us to show evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> effects for these two mutations suggesting a remote degree of consanguinity between the families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other, more frequent polymorphisms, G to A 1905 (exon 12), A to G 2848 (exon 19), A to G 5551 (exon 37), and G to A 6286 (exon 42), were used as intragenic markers for prenatal diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study provides valuable methods for determining the molecular defects in LAMA2 causing merosin deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
