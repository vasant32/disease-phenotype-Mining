<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Laminin alpha2 chain (LAMA2), however, is absent from muscles of some <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> patients and the dystrophia muscularis (dy/dy) mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LAMA2 restoration was investigated following cell transplantation in vivo in dy/dy mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic primary muscle cell cultures expressing the beta-galactosidase transgene under control of a muscular promoter, or histocompatible primary muscle cell cultures, were transplanted into dy/dy mouse muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FK506 immunosuppression was used in noncompatible models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> transplanted animals expressed LAMA2 in these immunologically-controlled models, and the degrees of LAMA2 restoration were shown to depend on the age of the animal at transplantation, on muscle pretreatment, and on duration time after transplantation in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LAMA2 did not always colocalize with new or hybrid muscle fibers formed by the fusion of donor myoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LAMA2 deposition around muscle fibers was often segmental and seemed to radiate from the center to the periphery of the injection site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic conditionally immortalized pure myogenic cells expressing the beta-galactosidase transgene were characterized in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When injected into FK506-immunosuppressed dy/dy mice, these cells formed new or hybrid muscle fibers but essentially did not express LAMA2 in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data show that partial LAMA2 restoration is achieved in LAMA2-deficient dy/dy mouse by primary muscle cell culture transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> myoblasts, or myoblasts alone, or the muscle fibers they form are capable of LAMA2 secretion and deposition in vivo </plain></SENT>
