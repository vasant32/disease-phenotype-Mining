<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (MDC1C), with presentation at birth, severe <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and inability to stand unsupported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The other 18 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (LGMD2I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven showed a Duchenne-like course with loss of ambulation in the early teens while 7 had a milder phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsy invariably showed abnormal expression of a-dystroglycan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MDC1C patients either carried 2 missense or 1 missense and 1 nonsense mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with LGMD2I shared a common mutation (C826A,Leu276Ileu) and their phenotypic severity was correlated with the second allelic mutation </plain></SENT>
