<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evaluations from both a clinical and a neuroradiological point of view were made of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> functions of 12 unselected Western children affected by CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In five patients, clinical observation and intelligence tests showed a mild to <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of these patients suffered also from a severe form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the same five patients, various degrees of white matter hypodensity, ventricular enlargement and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> were also detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar neuroradiological abnormalities were also found in five of the seven children who did not have clinical symptoms or signs of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one of these cases, necropsy neuropathological examination showed the gyral anomalies characteristic of the Japanese type of CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study clearly indicates the high frequency of subclinical <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> alterations in typical Western CMD, suggesting that it should be considered a type of myoencephalopathy like its Japanese counterpart </plain></SENT>
