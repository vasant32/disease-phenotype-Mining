<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 75 patients diagnosed as having muscle disease, 55 (73.3%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 55 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> patients, 28 (50.9%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, 11 (20%) had Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, 9 (16.4%) had Becker <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, 4 (7.3%) had myotonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath>, 2 (3.6%) had limb-girdle <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath>, and 1 (1.8%) patient had facioscapulohumeral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Parental consanguinity was documented in 21 (75%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> cases, and family history of possible similar cases in 15 (53.6%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to previous reports, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> is probably more common in communities with high rates of parental consanguinity than other <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophies</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
