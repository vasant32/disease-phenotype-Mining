<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Dystroglycanopathies are a group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> (CMDs) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive inheritance</z:hpo>, often associated with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> and ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are characterized by the abnormal glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, and caused by mutations in at least six genes encoding enzymes: FKTN, POMGNT1, POMT1, POMT2, FKRP, and LARGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>POMT2 mutations have recently been identified in Walker-Warburg syndrome and in a milder muscle-eye-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e>-like form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied mentally retarded patients with CMD, analyzed POMT2 by sequencing the coding regions, and also performed a haplotype analysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and their family members carrying the new POMT2 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We report three novel POMT2 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of these, p.Tyr666Cys, was homozygous in two unrelated patients and in a compound heterozygous state in others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed severe diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo>, and marked lordoscoliosis with hyperextended head </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elevated CK levels, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cerebral cortical atrophy</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001320'>cerebellar vermis hypoplasia</z:hpo> were constant findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo>, focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter abnormalities</z:hpo>, or partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002079'>corpus callosum hypoplasia</z:hpo> were detected in single cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eye involvement was absent or mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By genotype analysis, we defined a distinct 170kb haplotype encompassing POMT2 and shared by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the subjects harboring the mutation p.Tyr666Cys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results broaden the clinical spectrum associated with POMT2 mutations, which should be considered in patients with CMD associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo> with or without ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
