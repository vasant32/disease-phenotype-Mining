<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To gain greater insight into the biochemical and molecular events that link alpha2-laminin deficiency with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003713'>muscle fiber necrosis</z:hpo>, and the associated compensatory responses, gene expression profiles were characterized in diaphragm muscle from 8-wk-old dy/dy mice using oligonucleotide microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared with age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> muscle, dystrophic diaphragm was characterized by predominantly augmented gene expression, irrespective of the fold-change threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the 69 genes with at least plus or minus twofold significantly altered expression, 30 belonged to statistically overrepresented Gene Ontology (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e>) biological process groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These covered four specific themes: development including muscle development, cell motility with an emphasis on muscle contraction, defense/immune response, and cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An additional 11 gene transcripts were assigned to more general overrepresented <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> biological process groups (e.g., cellular process, organismal physiological process); the remaining 28 did not belong to any overrepresented groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> cellular constituent assignment resulted in the highest degree of overrepresentation in extracellular and muscle fiber locations, whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> molecular function assignment was most notable for various types of binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR was performed on 38 of 41 genes with at least plus or minus twofold significantly altered expression that were assigned to overrepresented <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> biological process groups, with expression changes verified for 36 of 38 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that several specific groups of genes have altered expression in response to genetic alpha2-laminin deficiency, with both similarities and differences compared with data reported for dystrophin-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
