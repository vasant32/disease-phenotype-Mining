<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the cases of 18 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, six of whom also have involvement of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, corresponding to the Fukuyama type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In four patients, both the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and the eyes are involved, and the diagnosis of "muscle, eye and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e>" was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A comparative study of these patients with those whose cases were recently reported indicates that there is a wide variability of clinical and laboratory expression of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath>, but a constant feature in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients is a progression of motor disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> with brain abnormalities indicates a poor clinical prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At present it remains an open question whether the three variants of the disease are separate diseases or only different expressions of the same syndrome, but our study tends to support the latter hypothesis </plain></SENT>
