<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> is due to defects in protein O-mannosyltransferase 1 (POMT1), which catalyzes the transfer of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> to protein to form O-mannosyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
