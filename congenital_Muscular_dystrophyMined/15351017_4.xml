<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003634'>Abnormal glia</z:mp> limitans could be considered the major pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0007260'>cobblestone lissencephaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this group, protein-O-linked <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi>-beta1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase and protein-O-mannosyltransferase 1 are considered to be responsible for muscle-eye-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> and Walker-Warburg syndrome, respectively, by glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the functions of fukutin, a gene responsible for Fukuyama type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, are still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, expression of the three aforementioned genes was compared by in situ hybridization in control cases to elucidate the functions of fukutin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry of fukutin and alpha-dystroglycan was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three genes were expressed in astrocytes and in immature neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A few mature neurons expressed fukutin, but many expressed the other two genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> genes were expressed in various non-<z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> tissues including tissues relating to secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fukutin and alpha-dystroglycan were generally colocalized, but localization was not always the same, especially in the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fukutin may be associated with the glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, and expression in astrocytes may indicate a relation to glia limitans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The roles of fukutin in mature neurons may be less critical compared with the other two genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additional functions of fukutin, especially in the liver, are suspected </plain></SENT>
