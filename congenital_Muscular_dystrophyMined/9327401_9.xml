<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the distribution of laminin beta 2 chain in the skeletal muscle basement membrane of 16 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A dramatic reduction in the laminin beta 2 staining was observed in four patients with classical merosin-negative CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A moderate reduction of laminin beta 2 labelling was observed in four patients with partial merosin deficiency and two patients with merosin-positive CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients with merosin-positive CMD had no apparent changes in the expression of laminin beta 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In three patients and one fetus diagnosed as Walker-Warburg syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e>) the laminin beta 2 pattern was similar to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that a primary deficiency in the laminin alpha 2 chain may lead to a vast or moderate reduction in the laminin beta 2 chain in the skeletal muscle membrane </plain></SENT>
