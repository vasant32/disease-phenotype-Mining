<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Family history, consanguinity, pregnancy, delivery, number and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo>, and outcome were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Laboratory investigations had been performed and a biopsy of muscle from an affected limb had been examined histochemically and by electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five biopsies showed fiber type 1 predominance and three had type 2 predominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patterns of fiber-type predominance may have resulted from altered neural influence leading to impaired maturation of type 1 or 2 motor units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had been followed up for 3-8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two were still not walking at age 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the 6 who were walking, the mean age at ambulation was 4.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no deterioration in power </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsy is recommended in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002804'>arthrogryposis multiplex congenita</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Identification of a probable neurogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002804'>arthrogryposis multiplex congenita</z:hpo> is important because the condition is not progressive and is apparently not transmitted genetically </plain></SENT>
