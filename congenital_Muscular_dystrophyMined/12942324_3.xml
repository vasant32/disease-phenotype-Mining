<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to investigate the expression of aquaporin 4 (AQP4) in the muscle plasma membrane of children with Fukuyama-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD) at protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The biopsied six muscles with FCMD, six histochemically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> muscles and eight disease control muscles were analyzed by means of immunoblots, immunohistochemistry and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunoblots showed that the band of FCMD muscle extracts stained with anti-AQP4 antibody was faint in comparison with that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> muscle extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemistry revealed that most of the FCMD myofibers showed negative immunostaining with anti-AQP4 antibody, although the partially positive immunostaining of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> FCMD myofibers was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The immunoreactivity was positive with anti-dystrophin and anti-beta-spectrin antibodies in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> FCMD myofibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that the AQP4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level of the FCMD muscles was markedly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these findings, we conclude that the expression of AQP4 in FCMD myofibers is reduced and the reduced content of AQP4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in FCMD muscles may be related to the decreased expression of AQP4 at the muscle plasma membrane of FCMD myofibers </plain></SENT>
