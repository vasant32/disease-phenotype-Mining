<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reports of different clinico-pathological phenotypes of CMD and recently of immunocytochemical and molecular genetic studies allowed the precise definition of specific entities within the group of CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we present the historical background of CMD, its vicissitudes and the main steps leading to the individualisation of the merosin-deficient CMD to which the author has contributed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mention is also made to major achievements in the characterisation of other types of CMD, namely the Fukuyama CMD, the muscle-eye-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> and a peculiar form of CMD with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> of the spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animal models of merosin-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> were identified and their current study may lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of the human disease and to therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
