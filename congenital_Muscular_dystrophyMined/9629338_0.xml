<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A study of clinical, laboratory and histopathological features of 18 patients with CMD was performed in relation to the merosin expression in muscle biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry study showed that merosin was deficient in 11 patients and present in 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of the 9 merosin-deficient patients evaluated achieved walking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 4 of 7 merosin-positive patients achieved independent ambulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">Creatine</z:chebi> kinase levels were higher in merosin-deficient patients, but this difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Motor nerve conduction study was carried out on 12 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 4 merosin-positive patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> exams whereas 2 out 8 merosin-deficient patients presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0003431'>decreased motor nerve conduction velocity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 69 histopathological features studied, we did not find any significant difference between merosin-deficient and merosin-positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that merosin status evaluation is important in the determination of the prognostic, since merosin-positive patients can achieve independent walking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study also suggests that there is no relation between absence of merosin and histopathological features </plain></SENT>
