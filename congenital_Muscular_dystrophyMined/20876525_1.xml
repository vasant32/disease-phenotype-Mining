<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to muscle loss is needed to develop therapeutic interventions for this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, the authors show that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is an early feature of pathogenesis in Lama2-deficient mouse muscle, indicated by elevated expression of tenascin C in the endomysium around muscle fibers, infiltration of macrophages, and induction of the inflammatory cytokines <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor α (TNFα) and IL-1β </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the expression of lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor-1 (LYVE-1), a specific marker for lymphatic vessel endothelial cells, is dramatically reduced early in Lama2-deficient muscle pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LYVE-1 expression, which is inhibited by TNFα, is also decreased in muscles undergoing degeneration due to dystrophin deficiency and cardiotoxin damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LYVE-1 expression thus provides a useful biomarker to monitor the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of muscle pathogenesis, likely serving as an indicator of inflammatory signals present in muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together, the data show that inflammatory pathways are activated in the earliest stages of Lama2-deficient disease progression and could play a role in early <z:mp ids='MP_0000749'>muscle degeneration</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
