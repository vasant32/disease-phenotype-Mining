<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The molecular basis is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcription-PCR amplification performed on <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> extracted from fibroblasts or muscle of three Ullrich patients followed by heteroduplex analysis displayed heteroduplexes in one of the three genes coding for collagen type VI (COL6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patient A, we detected a homozygous insertion of a C leading to a premature termination codon in the triple-helical domain of COL6A2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both healthy consanguineous parents were carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patient B, we found a deletion of 28 nucleotides because of an A --&gt; G substitution at nucleotide -2 of intron 17 causing the activation of a cryptic acceptor site inside exon 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second mutation was an exon skipping because of a G --&gt; A substitution at nucleotide -1 of intron 23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both mutations are present in an affected brother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The first mutation is also present in the healthy mother, whereas the second mutation is carried by their healthy father </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patient C, we found only one mutation so far-the same deletion of 28 nucleotides found in patient B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this case, it was a de novo mutation, as it is absent in her parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein analysis of patient B showed very low amounts of COL6A2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and of COL6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A near total absence of COL6 was demonstrated by immunofluorescence in fibroblasts and muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that Ullrich syndrome is caused by recessive mutations leading to a severe reduction of COL6 </plain></SENT>
