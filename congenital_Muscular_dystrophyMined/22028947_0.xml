<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was the muscle strength evaluated with a myometer and expressed as megalimbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The megalimbs score showed significant improvement (P = 0.01) in 5 of the 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Motor function did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Respiratory function deteriorated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CsA treatment corrected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction, increased <z:mp ids='MP_0000750'>muscle regeneration</z:mp>, and decreased the number of apoptotic nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results from this study demonstrate that long-term treatment with CsA ameliorates performance in the limbs, but not in the respiratory muscles of UCMD patients, and that it is well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest considering a trial of CsA or nonimmunosuppressive cyclosporins, that retains the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi>-desensitizing properties of CsA, as early as possible in UCMD patients when diaphragm is less compromised </plain></SENT>
