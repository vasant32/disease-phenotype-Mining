<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, a rare form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> has been shown to be associated with a deficiency of laminin alpha 2 chain, a tissue-specific component of the basal lamina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Besides <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, children affected with this disorder also show electrophysiological and magnetic resonance imaging evidence of white matter involvement in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have studied the precise localization of laminin alpha 2 chain in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human brain, using specific electron microscopic techniques including thin-section fracture labeling and cryoultramicrotomy, in parallel with immunohistochemical techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that this laminin chain was localized to the basal lamina of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cerebral blood vessels, whereas blood vessels of the choroid plexus did not show any reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No positive reaction was found in meningeal blood vessels either </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain, laminin alpha 2 may be important for the selective filtration capability of the blood-brain barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lack of laminin alpha 2 in cerebral vessels of children with laminin alpha 2-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> may cause impaired selective filtration, leading to leakage of plasma components and damage to the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies should be performed on patients affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> associated with laminin alpha 2 deficiency to test this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
