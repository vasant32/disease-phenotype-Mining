<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Remarkable differences were noticed between the two conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e>, which involved diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001339'>agyria</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, was more severe than that in FCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> the septum pellucidum was absent, and the corpus callosum, basal ganglia and thalami were markedly hypoplastic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cerebellum was severely hypoplastic and the vermis was partly absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pyramidal tracts could not be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the general configuration of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> was well preserved in FCMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cerebral cortices exhibited diffuse or focal micropolygyria with or without a few pachygyric lesions, but the severity was variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cerebellum was not hypoplastic, but exhibited focal micropolygyria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pyramidal tracts were aberrant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> and FCMD, however, did not show any distinct differences on microscopic analysis of the cerebral cortices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was leptomeningeal glio-mesenchymal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo>, and the horizontal lamination of the nerve cells was distorted throughout by proliferating gliovascular bundles or septa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We found in this study that the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> pathology in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> was compatible with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007260'>type II lissencephaly</z:hpo>, and thus differed from that in FCMD </plain></SENT>
