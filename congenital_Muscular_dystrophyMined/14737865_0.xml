<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three Japanese patients from 2 families had a phenotype indistinguishable from that of Fukuyama-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (FCMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A full mutational analysis of the fukutin gene, however, revealed neither a 3 kb insertion (the Japanese <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutation) nor a point mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A RT-PCR analysis of one of the patients revealed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> expression of the fukutin transcript, suggesting that they have a new variant of CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An immunohistochemical analysis of the muscle of one case showed that the immunoreaction to alpha-dystroglycan (DG) was barely detectable on the surface membranes of muscle fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactions to beta-DG, dystrophin, laminin alpha-2 chain and sarcoglycan were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings raise the possibility that the abnormality of alpha-DG is integral to the pathology seen in this variant of CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of POMGnT1 gene, which is causative of muscle-eye-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e>, revealed no mutation in this case </plain></SENT>
