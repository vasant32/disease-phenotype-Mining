<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>So far, only one gene, LAMA2 (6q2), which encodes the laminin alpha2 chain (or merosin), has been identified in these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in LAMA2 cause CMD with complete or partial merosin deficiency, detectable by immunocytochemistry on muscle biopsies, and account for approximately 50% of CMD cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a large consanguineous family (11 siblings) comprising three children affected by CMD without merosin deficiency, we undertook a genomewide search by homozygosity mapping and analyzed 380 microsatellite markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The affected children were homozygous for several markers on chromosome 1p35-36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified two additional consanguineous families with affected children who also showed linkage to this locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A maximum cumulative LOD score of 4.48, at a recombination fraction of .00, was obtained with D1S2885 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A consistent feature in these three families was the presence of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> of the spine, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002792'>reduced vital capacity</z:hpo>, as found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003306'>rigid-spine</z:hpo> syndrome (RSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study is the first description of a locus for a merosin-positive CMD and will help to better define the nosology of RSS </plain></SENT>
