<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It represents the most severe clinical phenotype in a spectrum of diseases associated with abnormal post-translational processing of a-dystroglycan that share a defect in laminin-binding glycan synthesis1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although mutations in six genes have been identified as causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e>, only half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals with the disease can currently be diagnosed on this basis2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A cell fusion complementation assay in fibroblasts from undiagnosed individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> was used to identify five new complementation groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further evaluation of one group by linkage analysis and targeted sequencing identified recessive mutations in the ISPD gene (encoding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24913">isoprenoid</z:chebi> synthase domain containing) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pathogenicity of the identified ISPD mutations was shown by complementation of fibroblasts with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> ISPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, we show that recessive mutations in ISPD abolish the initial step in laminin-binding glycan synthesis by disrupting dystroglycan O-mannosylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This establishes a new mechanism for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
