<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We recently reported a severe deficiency in collagen type VI, resulting from recessive mutations of the COL6A2 gene, in patients with Ullrich <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their parents, who are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> carriers of one mutant allele, are unaffected, although heterozygous mutations in collagen VI caused Bethlem <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we investigated the consequences of three COL6A2 mutations in fibroblasts from patients and their parents in two Ullrich families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three mutations lead to nonsense-mediated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> decay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, very low levels of undegraded mutant <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> remained in patient B with compound heterozygous mutations at the distal part of the triple-helical domain, resulting in deposition of abnormal microfibrils that cannot form extensive networks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This observation suggests that the C-terminal globular domain is not essential for triple-helix formation but is critical for microfibrillar assembly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parents, the COL6A2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels are reduced to 57-73% of the control, but long term collagen VI matrix depositions are comparable with that of the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The almost complete absence of abnormal protein and near-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> accumulation of microfibrils in the parents may account for their lack of myopathic symptoms </plain></SENT>
