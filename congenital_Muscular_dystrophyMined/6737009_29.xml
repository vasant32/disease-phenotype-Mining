<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have categorized the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> into three major patterns, each with a predictable topography despite individual variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebellar micropolygyria was localized to the dorsal halves of each hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aberrant fascicles of myelinated nerve fibers, closely associated with micropolygyria, were found in the subarachnoid space of the dorsal cerebellar surface in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We discuss the characteristics of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo> of FCMD, particularly in relation to that of Walker's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001339'>lissencephaly</z:hpo>, pathogenesis, and the relationship between lesions of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
