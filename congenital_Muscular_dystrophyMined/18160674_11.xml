<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (CMD) in a large Australasian cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We screened 101 patients with CMD with a combination of immunofluorescence, Western blotting, and DNA sequencing to identify disease-associated abnormalities in glycosylated alpha-dystroglycan, collagen VI, laminin alpha2, alpha7-integrin, and selenoprotein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 45% of the CMD cohort were assigned to an immunofluorescent subgroup based on their abnormal staining pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abnormal staining for glycosylated alpha-dystroglycan was present in 25% of patients, and approximately half of these had reduced glycosylated alpha-dystroglycan by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of the FKRP, fukutin, POMGnT1, and POMT1 genes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with abnormal alpha-dystroglycan immunofluorescence identified mutations in one patient for each of these genes and two patients had mutations in POMT2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve percent of patients had abnormalities in collagen VI immunofluorescence, and we identified disease-causing COL6 mutations in eight of nine patients in whom the genes were sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Laminin alpha2 deficiency accounted for only 8% of CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>alpha7-Integrin staining was absent in 12 of 45 patients studied, and ITGA7 gene mutations were excluded in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We define the distribution of different forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003741'>congenital muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> in a large cohort of mixed ethnicity and demonstrate the utility and limitations of current diagnostic techniques </plain></SENT>
