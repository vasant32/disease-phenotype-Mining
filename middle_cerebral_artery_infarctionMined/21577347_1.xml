<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was a randomized controlled trial in 60 patients with recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After hospital discharge for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> care, they were randomly assigned to receive either a home rehabilitation program for three months (intervention group) or usual care (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We collected outcome data over three months after their discharge from the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Barthel Index (BI), the Modified Rankin Scale (MRS), the health-related quality-of-life index (EQ-5D), the Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> score (HADs), and the Thai Mental State Examination (TMSE) were used to analyze the outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the intervention group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> outcomes were significantly better (p&lt;0.05) than in the control group, except in the case of TMSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A favorable outcome, which was defined as minimal or no disability as measured by BI (score 95-100), was achieved by 93.33% of patients in the intervention group, and 90% had favorable scores (0 or 1) on the MRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This showed a benefit in reducing disability, with two being the number of patients considered as needed-to-treat (NNT) (95% CI, 1.0-1.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> dimensions of EQ-5D in the intervention group were significantly better for quality of life and generic health status than in the control group (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> was found in one patient (3.33%) in the intervention group and in two patients (6.67%) in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was found in three patients (10%) in the intervention group and in four patients (13.33%) in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We concluded that an early home rehabilitation program for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the first three-month period provides significantly better outcomes in improving function, reducing disability, increasing quality of life, and reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> than a program of usual care does </plain></SENT>
