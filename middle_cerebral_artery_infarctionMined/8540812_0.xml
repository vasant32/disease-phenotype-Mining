<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether findings on computed tomography (CT) are useful to predict early mortality after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An admission CT was performed in 98 patients with disease-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> within 7 days; CT findings were analyzed using a checking list; their influence on hospital mortality was studied by logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 29 hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393985" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Uncal herniation</z:e> and midline shift &gt; 4 mm were strongly correlated with fatal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also associated with increased mortality: infarction of a whole hemisphere or in the distribution of internal carotid artery; massive (&gt; 90% expected area) infarction in the territory of the anterior or posterior cerebral arteries; massive or submassive (&gt; 50% expected area) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e>; large lesion volume (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 9/13 patients with lesions &gt; 50cm3); any degree of mass effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 68 patients with single middle cerebral artery lesions, extension of the lesion to adjacent vascular territories was also associated with a worse outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of lesions and the presence of contrast enhancement, hemorrhagic changes or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> did not influence outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CT findings indicating significant mass effect and large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are associated with mortality after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The best combination of clinical and CT variables to estimate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> risk in individual patients remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
