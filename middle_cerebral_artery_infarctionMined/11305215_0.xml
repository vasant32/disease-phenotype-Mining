<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Imaging revealed total infarction of the area supplied by the right middle cerebral artery with the threat of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Once informed consent had been obtained from the patient's representatives, hemicraniectomy with dural augmentation was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the primary neurological deficit persisted, the three patients assessed their quality of life as valuable with their Barthel scores ranging from 45 to 90 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total infarction of the middle cerebral artery may result in intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393985" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transtentorial herniation</z:e> owing to the development of cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, particularly in young patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prognosis of this condition is poor partly due to the limited effect of non-surgical treatment </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This operation reduces mortality considerably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The findings in these patients along with the results in the literature warrant a randomised study of the results of hemicraniectomy in patients with malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
