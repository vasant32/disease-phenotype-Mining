<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: "Sinking skin flap" (SSF) syndrome is a rare complication after large craniectomy that may progress to "paradoxical" <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> as a consequence of atmospheric pressure exceeding intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence and characteristics of SSF syndrome after hemicraniectomy for malignant infarction of the middle cerebral artery are not well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed a prospective cohort of 27 patients who underwent hemicraniectomy for malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had a clinical and brain imaging follow-up at 3 months and were followed until cranioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three of 27 patients (11%) had, at 3 to 5 months posthemicraniectomy, SSF syndrome with severe orthostatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> as the main symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, 4 patients (15%) had radiological SSF syndrome but no clinical symptoms except <z:hpo ids='HP_0007359'>partial seizures</z:hpo> in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with SSF syndrome had a smaller surface of craniectomy (76.2 cm(2) versus 88.7 cm(2), P=0.05) and a tendency toward larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, an older age, and a longer delay to cranioplasty than those without this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SSF syndrome either clinically symptomatic or asymptomatic affects one fourth of patients 3 to 5 months after hemicraniectomy for malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It should be diagnosed as early as possible to avoid progression to a paradoxical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
