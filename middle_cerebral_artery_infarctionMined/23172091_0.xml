<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to analyse the final quality of life and the degree of satisfaction of patients and their relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analysed 21 patients one year after their operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The quality of life was evaluated using the Spanish version of the Sickness Impact Profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to determine the degree of retrospective satisfaction, we asked relatives and patients whether, now that the patient's current sequelae are known, they would have still agreed to a decompressive craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The physical sphere is felt to be more disrupted than that concerning emotional aspects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There are no differences in the quality of life between patients who have the right or the left hemisphere affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with a better functional situation report a better quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Altogether, 81% of patients said they were satisfied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite the fact that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients show a loss of quality of life after a decompressive craniectomy, most of them seem to be satisfied with the treatment they have received, even in cases in which the dominant hemisphere is compromised or in those with a moderate-severe disability </plain></SENT>
