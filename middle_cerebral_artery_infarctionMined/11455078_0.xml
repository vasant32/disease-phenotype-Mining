<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A single subject research study was conducted using a withdrawal design (A-B-A-B-A) on three patients with ischaemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were recruited with stage 3 or 4 Fugl-Meyer scores in the lower extremity and the ability to ambulate independently without walking <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on this withdrawal design, the daily procedure included walking at comfortable speeds 5x10 meters during the A_1 phase and 3x10 meters during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subsequent phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This procedure was repeated for five consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two lbs (B_1) and 6 lbs (B_2) weight cuffs were attached to the distal lower hemiparetic extremity and randomized over the two B phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Control (A_1, A_2, A_3) and intervention (B_1, B_2) phases were alternated with brief resting periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean comfortable walking speed for 10 meters constituted the outcome variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed significant differences between phases (chi^2 = 34.187; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, with the exception of a carry-over effect between the A_1 (0.86 m/sec) and A_2 (0.89~m/<z:chebi fb="63" ids="30000">sec</z:chebi>) phases in one subject (p=0.043) no significant carry-over effects were found on ensuing A_2 and A_3 control phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although gradual improvements in comfortable walking speed between subsequent days were found the present pilot study did not demonstrate favorable group effects on comfortable walking speed as a result of limb overloading </plain></SENT>
