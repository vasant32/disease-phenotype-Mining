<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The benefit of decompressive surgery in these patients is still matter of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a prospective study we performed craniectomy in 37 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> and progressive deterioration under conservative antiedematous therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients treated conservatively during the same period served as control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> survivors were reexamined between one to two years after surgical decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, neuropsychological tests were performed, including an Aachener Aphasie Test (AAT) in those patients with infarction of speech-dominant hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical evaluation was graded using the Barthel index (BI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mortality rate in the operated group was 37% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients survived <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and were reexamined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite complete hemispheric infarction, no patient suffered from complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> or was permanently wheel chair bound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In speech dominant hemispheric infarction (n = 8) only mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> could be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean BI was 64 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mortality rate in the conservatively treated group was 76% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcome following craniectomy for the treatment of severe ischemic hemispheric infarction is unexpectedly good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, decompressive surgery should be considered in cases of space-occupying hemispheric infarctions and conservatively uncontrollable intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
