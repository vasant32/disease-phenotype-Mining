<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Perfusion CT has been used to assess the extent of blood-brain barrier breakdown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the predictive value of blood-brain barrier permeability measured using perfusion CT for development of malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> requiring hemicraniectomy (HC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients from our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> and were evaluated with admission perfusion CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood-brain barrier permeability and cerebral blood volume maps were generated and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and radiographic characteristics were compared between those who underwent HC versus those who did not undergo HC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two patients (12 HC, 110 no HC) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients who underwent HC had developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, midline shift, or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> permeability area, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cerebral blood volume area, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were significantly different (P &lt; 0.018, P &lt; 0.0211, P &lt; 0.0001, P &lt; 0.0014) between HC and no HC groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age (P = 0.03) and admission National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (P = 0.0029) were found to be independent predictors for HC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using logistic regression modeling, there was an association between increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> permeability area and HC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The OR for HC based on a 5-, 10-, 15-, or 20-cmÂ² increase in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> permeability area were 1.179, 1.390, 1.638, or 1.932, respectively (95% CI, 1.035 to 1.343, 1.071 to 1.804, 1.108 to 2.423, 1.146 to 3.255, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> permeability area is associated with an increased likelihood for undergoing HC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because early HC for malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> has been associated with better outcomes, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> permeability area on admission perfusion CT might be a useful tool to predict malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> and need for HC </plain></SENT>
