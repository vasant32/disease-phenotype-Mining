<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> (ICP) who are undergoing invasive intensive care therapy require technical monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the effectiveness of the current gold standard, measurement of ICP, is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the effects of what is considered to be standard antiedema medical treatment are not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied whether multimodal monitoring can help to overcome this problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ICP, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and partial brain tissue oxygen pressure (PbrO(2)) were continuously measured within the white matter of the frontal lobe unilaterally or bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the effects of antiedema drugs and looked for pattern changes in the PbrO(2) before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393985" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transtentorial herniation</z:e> in patients in whom this could not be prevented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, complications were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We performed 27 measurements in 21 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 297 antiedema drug administrations were analyzed in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hyper-HAES and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> were most often associated with an increase in CPP and PbrO(2), whereas the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9754">tromethamine</z:chebi> led to negative or contrary effects, although ICP was decreased in every case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pattern changes in the PbrO(2) curve could be observed between 6 to 18 hours before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393985" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transtentorial herniation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complication or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Multimodal monitoring can be used to monitor antiedema drug effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that with multimodal monitoring, pathophysiological changes could be predicted considerably in advance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>ICP alone is of questionable use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this method might help to optimize the timing of invasive therapy in space-occupying infarction </plain></SENT>
