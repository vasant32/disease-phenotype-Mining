<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The outcome is described in terms of survival, impairment, disabilities and life satisfaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were examined at a minimum of 1 year (mean 2.9, range 1-6) after the surgery and classified according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> scale (NIHSS), the Barthel Index (BI), the short-form health survey (SF-36) and the life satisfaction checklist (LiSat-11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The long-term survival was 78% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean NIHSS score was 13.8 (range 6-20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patient was left in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917808" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vegetative state</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean BI was 63.9 (5-100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The SF-36 scores showed that the patients' view of their health was significantly lower in most items compared with that of a reference group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>According to the LiSat checklist, 83% found their life satisfying/rather satisfying and 17% found their life rather dissatisfying/dissatisfying </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that the patients remained in an impaired neurological condition, but had fairly good insight into their limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although their life satisfaction was lower compared with that of the controls, the majority felt that life in general could still be satisfying </plain></SENT>
