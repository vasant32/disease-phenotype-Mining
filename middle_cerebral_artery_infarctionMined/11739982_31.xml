<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> has been found to reduce intracranial pressure (ICP) significantly in patients who have severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, during passive rewarming, ICP continuously rises and some patients suffer <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393985" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transtentorial herniation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated the question of whether slower rewarming leads to slower increase in ICP and slower decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we studied feasibility of slow, controlled rewarming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ICP, CPP, and core body temperature were monitored continuously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Achievement of rewarming protocol was assessed by hit rate of temperature target intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Side effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rates of change of both ICP and CPP were correlated significantly with increase in temperature (ICP r=0.62, P=0.002; CPP r=-0.50, P=0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In feasibility analysis of 13 controlled rewarmed patients, hit rate of temperature target intervals was 63% (median; range 48% to 81%); hit rate within the target interval or below was 79% (median; range 62% to 94%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Slow, controlled rewarming is feasible and may be used for ICP and CPP control after moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> for space-occupying infarction </plain></SENT>
