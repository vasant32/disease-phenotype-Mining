<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral protection devices improved the applicability of this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated applicability, safety and late clinical outcomes of percutaneous interventions for carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective study included 26 patients (15 female, 11 male, mean age 70+/-16 years) undergoing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting with different sizes of balloons and stents for 28 internal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery stenoses</z:e> at Kadir Has University Department of Interventional Radiology between March 2002 and December 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten patients were asymptomatic, one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo>, four had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> within last four months, one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0010819'>drop attacks</z:hpo>, one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, seven had the findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and three had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Stenosis rates were calculated according to North America Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median stenosis rate was 85% (range: 60%-95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the 28 internal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery stenoses</z:e> were managed with balloon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and stenting (technical success rate 100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median residual stenosis rate after procedure was 14% (range: 0%-30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004086'>Asystole</z:mp> developed in five patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> in eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> occurred in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient had intracranial reperfusion <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> four hours after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No procedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was observed within one month of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One patient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> four months after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Cranial computed tomography revealed multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> in one patient complaining of intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and primary source was found to be pulmonary <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No stent restenosis was defined at Doppler ultrasonographic examinations performed 6 and 12 months after procedures with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> flow patterns and velocities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Two patients underwent control angiography at 12th month and myointimal proliferations with insignificant obstruction (25% and 30%) were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Carotid artery stenting seems to be applicable and safe procedure but it is associated with infrequent major complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Results of studies comparing surgery and angioplasty will be helpful in defining role of stenting in the treatment of carotid occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
