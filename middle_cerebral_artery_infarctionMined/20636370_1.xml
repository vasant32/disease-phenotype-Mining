<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its benefits for other causes of non-traumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e>, if any, are unclear, especially after a devastating primary event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated the outcomes as well as treatment costs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> emergency decompressive craniectomies performed between the 2000 and 2006 in a single institution to lower intractable intracranial pressure, excluding the standard indications TBI and malignant middle <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was evaluated on the Euroqol (EQ-5D) scale, and cost of a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall 3-year mortality rate was 62% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH, 29 patients) and 31% for other neurological emergencies (13 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with SAH were on average 13 years older than the other indications mean </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the non-survivors, 45% died within a month and 95% within 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median EQ-5D index values were poor (0.15 for SAH and 0.62 for the other emergencies, versus 0.85 for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population), but of the survivors, 73% and 89% were able to live at home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cost of neurosurgical treatment for one QALY was 11,000 € for SAH and 2000 € for other emergencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Mortality after non-traumatic neurological emergencies leading to decompressive craniectomy was high, and the HRQoL index of the survivors was poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most survivors were, however, able to live at home, and the cost of neurosurgical treatment for a QALY gained was acceptable </plain></SENT>
