<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Second harmonic imaging (SHI) is a new ultrasound technique that is able to detect microbubbles in the tissue vascular space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this pilot study was to prove that this technique may detect focal abnormalities of cerebral echo-contrast enhancement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTIONS: Two male patients (aged 72 and 64 years) were included who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and no established demarcation of the ischemic area in CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After bolus application of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi>-based microbubbles, axial SHI examinations in a diencephalic plane of sections were performed using the transtemporal approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound investigations were recorded and evaluated offline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both individuals demarcated focal abnormalities of cerebral contrast enhancement were detectable: in patient 1 the region of the lentiform nucleus and the adjacent parts of the temporoparietal lobe was affected, and in patient 2 a large region including the lentiform nucleus and cortical white matter was involved for at least 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up CT scans demonstrated a striatocapsular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in patient 1 and complete <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction in patient 2, correlating with the presumed ischemic area in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ultrasound examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient with complete <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction showed missing contrast enhancement in the entire hemisphere of the affected side in follow-up SHI examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>He died of malignant space-occupying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the patient with the striatocapsular infarction, reappearance of echo-contrast enhancement in the ischemic area was assessable after 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SHI may identify focal abnormalities of cerebral echo-contrast enhancement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this technique helps to determine size, localization, and prognosis of the ischemic region and could be useful for bedside assessment of echo-contrast agent distribution related to brain tissue perfusion </plain></SENT>
