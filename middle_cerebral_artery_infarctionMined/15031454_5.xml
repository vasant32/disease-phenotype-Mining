<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated parametric images of the bolus washout kinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> internal carotid artery infarction were investigated with perfusion harmonic imaging after SonoVue bolus injection &lt; or =40 hour after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings were compared with those of cranial computed tomography (CCT) and clinical course 4 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Images of pixel-wise peak intensity (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) and time to peak intensity could be calculated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spearman rank correlations of r=0.772 (P&lt;0.001) and r=0.572 (P=0.008) between area of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> signal decrease and area of infarction in the follow-up CCT as well as outcome after 4 months were obtained, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the early phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, BHI after SonoVue bolus injection is a useful ultrasound tool for analyzing cerebral perfusion deficits at the patient's bedside </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BHI data correlate with the definite area of infarction and outcome after 4 months </plain></SENT>
