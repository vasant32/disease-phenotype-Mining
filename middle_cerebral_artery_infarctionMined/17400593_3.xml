<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied differences in recall of information and in appreciation of the informed consent procedure between representatives included in the Hemicraniectomy After <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> with Life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>Edema</z:hpo> Trial (HAMLET) and representatives of patients participating in the randomised trial of <z:chebi fb="58" ids="46195">Paracetamol</z:chebi> (Acetaminophen) In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> (PAIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 1 year after study inclusion, we contacted 30 consecutive representatives who had given informed consent for participation of their relative in HAMLET, and 30 for PAIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recall of trial details and appreciation of the informed consent procedure were investigated using standardised questionnaires and compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 30 PAIS representatives and 28 HAMLET representatives were interviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participation of their relative in a clinical trial was remembered by 86% of HAMLET and 40% of PAIS representatives (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HAMLET representatives remembered more trial details (effect of the treatment under study (61% vs 3%, p&lt;0.001); randomised treatment allocation (71% vs 0%, p&lt;0.001)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With respect to appreciation of the informed consent procedure, we found no differences between the groups: in each trial, four representatives (14% vs 13%) had considered the question of randomisation unacceptable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Participation of patients in a randomised controlled trial of surgical decompression for space occupying infarction is generally considered acceptable by their representatives, and recall of trial details is better than in a trial in which less vital issues are at stake </plain></SENT>
