<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Decompressive hemicraniectomy (DH) reduces mortality and improves the functional outcome of surviving patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine quality of life (QoL) and neurobehavioral deficits in patients with space-occupying infarctions of the right- or left-sided hemisphere at 6 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) was used to assess QoL in 19 out of 29 consecutive patients that underwent DH after a malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction (14 on the right and 5 on the left hemisphere) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>Behavioral changes</z:hpo> were evaluated with the Frontal Behavioral Inventory and the Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients and relatives were also asked if, knowing the present outcome, they would agree again, in retrospect, to a DH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Barthel Index &gt;60 was seen in 37% of our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was related to age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found a higher reduction in the SIP's physical domain than in the psychosocial domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Depressive symptoms were present in 50% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We didn't find significant differences in QoL or functional outcome between patients with right or left-sided infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most frequent neurobehavioral symptoms were decreased speech output, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo>, reduced spontaneity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most patients and their relatives would again give consent to hemicraniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results show that younger patients had a significantly better outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>QoL seems to be acceptable in both left- and right-sided infarctions, and retrospective agreement to hemicraniectomy is high in both patients and their relatives </plain></SENT>
