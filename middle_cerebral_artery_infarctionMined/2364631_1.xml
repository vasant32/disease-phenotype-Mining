<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We encountered two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751849" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">right middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> who showed a unique eye sign not described so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both had suddenly developed central facial <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> and hemisensory deficit in the left side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0234507" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Anosognosia</z:e> for the left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>, motor impersistence and left unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871399" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">spatial neglect</z:e> were also present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initially they showed difficulty in keeping their eyes closed to the same degree on both eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, this symmetrical motor impersistence of eye closing developed into a differential pattern over the days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, on verbal command to close the eyes, the right eye in the non-paretic side would be closed continuously and excessively and in the left eye in the paretic side would be closed slightly and impresistently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This dissociation of eye closure was not observed in spontaneous eye closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This symptom is close to the contralateral motor impersistence of eye closure which has been attributed to the right hemispheric lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>But the concurrence of the ipsilateral overcontraction of the orbicularis oculi has not been described to the authors' knowledge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We proposed a hypothesis on this unique right-left dissociation of eye closing behavior </plain></SENT>
