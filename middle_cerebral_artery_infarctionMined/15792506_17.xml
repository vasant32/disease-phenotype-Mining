<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hemicraniectomy reduces intracranial pressure and has been demonstrated to increase survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Questions remain regarding selection of patients for surgery and functional outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts, operative reports, and images of patients who underwent hemicraniectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> at our institution between 1990 and 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> volume and craniectomy area image analyses were performed with National Institutes of Health Image J software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Short-term outcome was measured with the Glasgow Outcome Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The requirement for second surgical decompression was also used as a measure of short-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Outcome 1 year after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was assessed with mailed self-report questionnaires to patients or providers with answers yielding information pertinent to the Barthel Index for physical disability, the Reintegration to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> Living Index, and the Zung <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to consider factors associated with outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients with large hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (average volume, 407 cm3) were treated with hemicraniectomy during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients survived more than 1 year after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients responded to a questionnaire scoring late physical disability (Barthel Index), quality of life (Reintegration to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> Living Index), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (Zung <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Index) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The average Barthel Index score was 67 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Barthel Index score and ability to walk were strongly correlated with age but not time to surgery, volume of infarction, or craniectomy size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients exhibited moderate to severe decrements in quality of life and increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Reoperation, an indicator for early operative failure, was required in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These patients were significantly younger and had significantly higher volumes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hemicraniectomy is life-saving treatment for large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Good functional outcomes can be obtained but are less likely in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Younger patients with large-volume <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> may benefit from multiple decompressions, if necessary </plain></SENT>
