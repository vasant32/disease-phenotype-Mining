<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Poorer cognitive performance was associated with worse functional outcome as assessed with the modified Rankin scale (β -0.4, 95 % CI -0.6 to -0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed between operated and non-operated patients </plain></SENT>
