<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Corresponding to the area of infarction in follow-up CCT, a marked contrast deficit was visualized in 19 of 24 patients by initial PHI, which had a sensitivity and specificity of 86.4% and 96.2%, respectively, for predicting the occurrence and localization of a definite infarction in the midthalamic plane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The area of hypoperfusion in the initial PHI investigation correlated with the definite area of infarction in follow-up CCT (r=0.66, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When time-intensity curves of both hemispheres were compared, the areas under the curve were significantly less in the symptomatic brain regions (p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With PHI and UCA bolus injection, it is possible to assess cerebral perfusion deficits that correlate with the definite area of infarction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
