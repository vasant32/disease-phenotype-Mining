<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine if previously hypertensive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> should be treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medication in the immediate poststroke period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Sixteen consecutive hypertensive patients (four men and 12 women; mean age, 66 years [age range, 46 to 83 years]) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> within 72 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and blood pressure between 170 and 220 mm Hg(systolic) and 95 and 120 mm Hg (diastolic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Placebo (n = 6), nicardipine <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> (20 mg [n = 5]), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> (12.5 mg [n = 3]), or <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> (0.1 mg [n = 2]) given every 8 hours for 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Decline in blood pressure, change in cerebral blood flow as measured by single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography, and clinical change as determined by the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Blood pressure fell significantly in both the drug-treated group as a whole and in those patients receiving placebo (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in blood pressure levels between these two groups throughout the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving nicardipine had a consistently lower pressure than the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant negative relationship was noted between the maximum blood pressure fall and improvement in cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were four patients whose blood pressure dropped by more than 16% of the baseline value on any 24 hours in the first 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> either failed to increase or actually decreased their cerebral blood flow to the affected area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three of these patients were treated with nicardipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in clinical course between the placebo-and drug-treated groups as a whole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hypertensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients with a moderate elevation of blood pressure in the first few days may not require <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Nicardipine and possibly other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> may cause an excessive fall in blood pressure and impair cerebral blood flow in these patients and should therefore be used with caution </plain></SENT>
