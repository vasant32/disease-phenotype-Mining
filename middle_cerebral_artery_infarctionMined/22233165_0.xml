<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study examines long-term neuropsychological and psychosocial outcomes of survivors of malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> treated via decompressive hemicraniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A case series design facilitated a detailed analysis of the outcomes among five participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological domains assessed included premorbid and current IQ, sustained, selective and divided attention, visual and auditory memory, executive functioning and visuo-spatial ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Psychosocial domains assessed included self-rated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants and their main carer were asked about their retrospective view of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants showed neuropsychological impairments in multiple cognitive domains, with preserved ability in others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Effects of laterality of brain function were evident in some domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was evident in two participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall quality of life was within average limits in three of four assessed participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four participants retrospectively considered surgery as having been a favourable course of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: While neuropsychological impairments are highly likely post-surgery, preserved abilities and social support may serve a protective function against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and an unacceptably poor quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Results do not support the suggestion that decompressive hemicraniectomy following malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> necessarily leads to unacceptable neuropsychological or psychosocial outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>[IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION:• Malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> is a life threatening condition.• The neurosurgical procedure, “decompressive hemicraniectomy” has been shown to be life-saving among patients with this condition.• There is little known about the long-term neuropsychological and psychosocial outcomes following decompressive hemicraniectomy for malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e>.• This study concludes that neuropsychological impairments are highly probable post-surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, preserved abilities and social support may serve a protective function against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and an unacceptably poor quality of life.] </plain></SENT>
