<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Malignant middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) infarction occurs in 10% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> and these severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> are associated with high mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent clinical trials demonstrated that early decompressive craniectomy reduce mortality rates and improves functional outcomes in healthy young patients (less than 61 years of age) with a malignant infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of decompressive craniectomy in elderly patients (older than 70 years of age) with a malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between February 2008 and October 2011, 131 patients were diagnosed with malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We divided these patients into two groups: patients who underwent decompressive craniectomy (n = 58) and those who underwent conservative care (n = 73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A cut-off point of 70 years of age was set, and the study population was segregated into those who fell above or below this point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality rates and functional outcome scores were assessed, and a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of &gt; 3 was considered to represent a poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mortality rates were significantly lower at 29.3% (one-month mortality rate) and 48.3% (six-month mortality rate) in the craniectomy group as compared to 58.9% and 71.2%, respectively, in the conservative care group (p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age (â‰¥70 years vs. &lt; 70 years) did not statistically differ between groups for the six-month mortality rate (p = 0.137) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the pre-operative National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score did contribute to the six-month mortality rate (p = 0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Decompressive craniectomy is effective for patients with a malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction regardless of their age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, factors other than age should be considered and the treatment should be individualized in elderly patients with malignant infarctions </plain></SENT>
