<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Large middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> when associated with extensive mass effect can result in brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> and neurological <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As yet there are few guidelines to aid the selection of patients for aggressive interventional therapies, such as decompression hemicraniectomy and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied a cohort of patients from seven centres with large <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction requiring neurocritical care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this analysis was to assess the use of early radiological signs on follow-up computed tomographic (CT) signs performed within 48 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> for predicting mortality at 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CT parameters assessed included horizontal displacement of the septum pellucidum, pineal shift, complete or partial infarction of the temporal lobe, involvement of additional vascular territories, and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-five patients who had follow-up CT scans within 48 h were identified from a total of 201 patients with large <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction that received conventional medical therapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median age was 68 (range 29-99), 56% were female, and the median NIHSS category was 26-30 at 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among CT variables in univariable analysis, anteroseptal shift &gt;/=5 mm, pineal shift &gt;/=2 mm, complete temporal lobe infarction, involvement beyond the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory, and moderate or <z:hpo ids='HP_0006882'>severe hydrocephalus</z:hpo> were equally predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis adjusting for time to CT scan revealed the following predictors of fatal outcome: anteroseptal shift &gt;/=5 mm (OR 10.9; 95% CI 3.2-37.6), NIHSS within 48 h &gt;20 (OR 6.6; 95% CI 2.3-19.3), and infarction beyond the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory (OR 4.9; 95% CI 1.6-15.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We identified the role of early CT signs in predicting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> following massive <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The CT parameters anteroseptal shift (&gt;5 versus &lt;/=5 mm), pineal shift &gt;/=2 mm, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, temporal lobe infarction, and other vascular territory infarction if present were predictive of fatal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These CT parameters require prospective validation before they should be considered reliable markers for decision-making </plain></SENT>
