<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Wallerian degeneration, the secondary degeneration of axons from cortical and subcortical injury, is associated with poor neurologic outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging is sensitive to early changes of cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, DW imaging may depict the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> injury to descending white matter tracts that precedes Wallerian degeneration; this injury is not visible on conventional CT or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images in the maturing human brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two neuroradiologists retrospectively analyzed clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images in six children (aged 3 days to 5 months) with DW findings consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> injury of the descending white matter tract due to territorial anterior or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In five patients, images were obtained as a part of routine clinical evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining patient was a part of a prospective study of brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Imaging findings were correlated with clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six patients, DW imaging performed 2-8 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> depicted injury to the descending white matter tract ipsilateral to the territorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images of the ipsilateral descending white matter tracts were abnormal in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients for which follow-up results were available, the presence of DW changes was correlated with persistent neurologic disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: As shown in this retrospective analysis, DW imaging can depict <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> injury to the descending white matter tract in neonates and infants, when conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging may show <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These DW findings likely precede the development of Wallerian degeneration, and they may portend a poor clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
