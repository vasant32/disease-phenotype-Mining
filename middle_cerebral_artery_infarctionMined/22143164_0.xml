<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In order to determine the impact of the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> on malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation, we investigated various degrees of perfusional deficit by (11)C-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5103">flumazenil</z:chebi> PET in patients with large middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 17 patients with large <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured 15.9 Â± 6.4 h after the ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into a malignant (n = 9) and a benign group (n = 8) as a function of their clinical courses and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>Edema</z:hpo> was measured as maximal midline shift on follow-up CTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total hypoperfusion volume was divided into different subvolumes according to the degree of CBF reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subvolumes of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> relative to total ischemic area were significantly larger in the malignant group than in the benign group and were significantly correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The highest correlation and best predictive values for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation with a sensitivity, specificity, and a positive and negative predictive value of 100% were found for subvolumes with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Correlation coefficients and prediction decreased for subvolumes with less severe perfusional deficit, pointing to the risk of misclassifying patients when relying on the volume of total perfusional deficit alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction seems to be determined more by the volume of severe perfusional deficit than that of total perfusional deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Assessment of severely ischemic areas allows prediction of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation and might help to select candidates for hemicraniectomy </plain></SENT>
