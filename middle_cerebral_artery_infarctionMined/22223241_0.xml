<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Identifying patients who will develop LTE is therefore imperative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that autonomic shift toward sympathetic dominance may relate to LTE formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the predictive potential of baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) as a marker of autonomic balance for calculating the course of large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> &gt;2/3 of the territory and BRS measurement at admission were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BRS was estimated using the cross-correlational method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Demographic, clinical, and radiological data including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, and basal ganglia involvement were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Malignant course with LTE was defined as clinical deterioration and midline shift â‰¥5 mm in the first 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen (62.8%) patients developed LTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with LTE had lower BRS (2.3 versus 4.4 mm Hg/ms, P=0.007), larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (214 versus 144 mL, P=0.03), more frequent involvement of the basal ganglia (14 versus 4, P=0.03), and more often underwent thrombolysis combined with endovascular intervention (6 versus 0, P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate model, BRS (OR, 0.36; CI, 0.14-0.93; P=0.03) and basal ganglia involvement (OR, 11.53; CI, 1.15-115.9; P=0.04) were independent predictors for LTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This model correctly classified 86.2% of the malignant cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Decreased BRS, mirroring sympathetic activation, and basal ganglia involvement were associated with development of malignant course with LTE in large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The predictive relevance of our findings needs to be confirmed in further studies </plain></SENT>
