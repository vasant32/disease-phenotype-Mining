<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: The functional organization of language, attention, and motor performance was investigated in a 42-year-old patient with crossed nonaphasia by means of functional MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The strongly right-handed man experienced a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751846" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">left middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> documented by MRI without exhibition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the left hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was accompanied by visuospatial impairment, right-sided slight sensory and motor <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp>, and right homonymous hemianopia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No history of familial sinistrality or prior neurological illness was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> language mapping revealed strong right hemispheric activation in inferior frontal and superior temporal cortices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finger tapping with the right hand recruited ipsilateral premotor and motor areas as well as supplementary motor cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A Stroop task, usually strongly associated with left-sided inferior frontal activation in dextrals, resulted in strong right hemispheric frontal activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: From our data there is clear evidence that different modalities, such as language perception and production, attention, and motor performance, are processed exclusively by 1 hemisphere when atypical cerebral dominance is present </plain></SENT>
