<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Whether decompressive hemicraniectomy is an appropriate treatment for space-occupying middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) infarction is still a controversial issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies are in agreement on a reduction of the mortality rate, but the reported functional outcome was highly variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors sought to determine functional impairment, disability, and health-related quality of life (QOL) outcome in long-term survivors who had undergone this procedure, and tried to identify factors related to functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 36 consecutive patients (mean age 58.8 +/- 12.7 years, 20 men and 16 women) who underwent decompressive hemicraniectomy for treatment of malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction (29 on the right and seven on the left side; mean time to surgery 37.8 +/- 20 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The survival rate was determined at 6 months: 13.7 +/- 6.7 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, a cross-sectional personal investigation of survivors was performed to assess functional impairment, disability, and health-related QOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival rates were 78% at 6 months and 64% at the time of the follow-up investigation; one patient was lost to follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of 22 long-term survivors lived at home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median Barthel Index (BI) was 45 (25th and 75th percentile 19 and 71) and the BI correlated negatively with patient age (r = -0.58, p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients reached a BI of at least 90 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Older age, more severe neurological deficit on admission, and longer duration of intensive care treatment and mechanical ventilation were significantly associated with worse disability (BI &lt; 50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The health-related QOL was considerably impaired in the subscales of mobility, household management, and body care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Decompressive hemicraniectomy improves survival in patients with malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction when compared with earlier reports of conservative treatment alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome and QOL remain markedly impaired, especially among elderly patients and in those with a severe neurological deficit at admission </plain></SENT>
