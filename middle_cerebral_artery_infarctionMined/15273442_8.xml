<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The long-term neuromotor outcome in paediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> ranges from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> to varying degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the indices of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI), fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity to determine if these indices can identify and quantify the presence of Wallerian degeneration in paediatric patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e>, and to determine if these quantitative parameters correlate with the neuromotor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven children (mean age 8.1 years) with evidence of unilateral middle cerebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on magnetic resonance imaging and 10 control subjects (mean age 8.7 years) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuromotor outcome was based on functions of the affected hand: mild (n = 3), moderate (n = 6), and severe (n = 2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity of the ipsilateral corticospinal tract were compared with matched contralateral regions using the Mann-Whitney U test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spearman's test was performed to study the relationship between neuromotor outcome and the following: ipsilateral-to-contralateral ratio of fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity and cerebral peduncle area, and the largest infarction size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For control subjects, there were no significant differences in fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity of the corticospinal tract between the right and left side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For patients, fractional anisotropy decreased by 18% and mean diffusivity increased by 8% in the ipsilateral compared to the contralateral corticospinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neuromotor outcome correlated with the ipsilateral-to-contralateral ratio of fractional anisotropy (r = -0.638, p = 0.035) but not with the mean diffusivity ratio, cerebral peduncle area ratio and largest infarction size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DTI can be used to detect and quantify Wallerian degeneration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> paediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our preliminary data show that loss of anisotropy in the corticospinal tract correlates with neuromotor outcome </plain></SENT>
