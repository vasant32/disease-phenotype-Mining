<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Whether decompressive hemicraniectomy is an appropriate treatment for malignant middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) infarction is still a controversial issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of our study were to determine survival rate and functional out-come and to determine factors associated with survival rates and functional outcome in patients with malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 2000 to December 2003, 60 patients with malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients in the study underwent a large ipsilateral craniectomy and a large duroplasty for decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The infarction territory was evaluated by either diffusion-weighted MRI or computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical neurologic presentation was evaluated using the Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was evaluated with the Barthel index (BI) and the Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) during the follow-up period of 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mortality was 20% (12 patients) during 30 days and 26.6% during 12 months' follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The factors associated with higher mortality were age &gt; or = 60 years, involvement of more than 1 vascular territory, clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> signs before surgery and treatment after 24 hours of ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean GOS was 3.3 +/- 1.7 during the 12-month follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean BI was 65.1 +/- 40.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine (65.9%) patients had favorable outcome (BI &gt; or = 60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The factors associated with favorable outcome were age &lt; 60 years, dominant hemisphere infarction, regaining of consciousness within 7 days after operation, being without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> and treatment within 24 hours of ictus before clinical signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Decompressive hemicraniectomy may be a useful procedure in patients with malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Age, clinical signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> and timing of surgery were the prognostic factors associated with mortality and functional outcome </plain></SENT>
