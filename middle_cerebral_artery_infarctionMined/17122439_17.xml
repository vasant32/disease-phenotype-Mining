<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To study cerebrovascular autoregulation and its impact on clinical course in patients with impending malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e>, we used invasive multimodal neuromonitoring, including measurement of cerebral perfusion pressure, tissue oxygen pressure, and microdialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that involved &gt;50% of the middle cerebral artery territory were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Probes were placed into the ipsilateral frontal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Autoregulation was assessed by calculation of the cerebral perfusion pressure-oxygen reactivity index (COR) and the correlation coefficient (R) of cerebral perfusion pressure and tissue oxygen pressure at 24 and 72 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: COR and R at 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were higher in the 8 patients with a malignant course (ie, massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation) compared with the 7 patients with a benign course (COR, 1.99+/-1.46 versus 0.68+/-0.29; R, 0.49+/-0.28 versus 0.06+/-0.31; P&lt;0.05), indicating impaired autoregulation in the malignant course group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 72 hours, further increases in COR and R were observed in the malignant course group in contrast to the benign course group with stable values over time (COR, 3.31+/-2.38 versus 0.75+/-0.31; R, 0.75+/-011 versus 0.36+/-0.27; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With a COR of 0.99, a cutoff value for prediction of a malignant course was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> ratio was higher in patients with a malignant compared with a benign course at both time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>COR, R, and the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> ratio showed significant correlations with outcome parameters as a midline shift on cranial computed tomography and score on the modified Rankin scale after 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found early impairment of cerebrovascular autoregulation in peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> tissue of patients who developed malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, whereas autoregulation was preserved in patients with a benign course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Impaired cerebral autoregulation seems to play a key role for development of a malignant course and might serve as a predictive marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Impaired cerebral autoregulation also accentuates the need for consequent adjustment of cerebral perfusion pressure in patients with impaired autoregulation </plain></SENT>
