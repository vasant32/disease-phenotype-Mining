<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Kinetics of an intravenous bolus of ICG were monitored by NIRS in 13 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarction in the territory of the middle cerebral artery (mean (SD) age, 62.2 (13.0) years) and 12 controls (64.2 (9.1) years) at 2.8 (2.8) days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NIRS optodes were placed bitemporally, with an interoptode distance of 4-5 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Absolute concentration changes in ICG were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following were assessed: time to peak, maximum ICG concentration, time interval between 0% and 100% maximum ICG concentration (interval), rise time (time between 10% and 90% ICG maximum), slope (maximum Delta ICG/interval), and blood flow index (BFI = maximum Delta ICG/rise time) of each hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intraindividual differences were calculated between the two hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had increased time to peak (p&lt;0.01), interval (p&lt;0.01), and rise time (p&lt;0.01), while maximum ICG concentration (p&lt;0.03), slope (p&lt;0.01), and BFI (p&lt;0.01) were diminished at the site of infarction compared with the unaffected hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, intraindividual differences in time to peak (p&lt;0.001), interval (p&lt;0.001), rise time (p = 0.001), maximum ICG concentration (p&lt;0.02), slope (p&lt;0.001), and BFI (p&lt;0.001) were greater than in the controls, with excellent sensitivity and specificity for Delta time to peak (100% and 100%, respectively) and Delta time interval (100% and 91.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of interhemispheric differences in ICG kinetics by NIRS detects perfusion reductions in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This non-invasive bedside test is rapid, repeatable, without major side effects, and avoids transportation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
