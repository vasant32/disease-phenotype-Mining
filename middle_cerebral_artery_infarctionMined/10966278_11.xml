<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients should be ventilated mechanically is still a contentious issue, because their outcome is very poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We wanted to investigate how often mechanical ventilation is indicated in patients with hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> as well as the outcome of these patients and the factors by which outcome is influenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University hospital, neurocritical care unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Subjects were 218 patients who met the following inclusion criteria: age 18-85 yrs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hemispheric ischemic infarction, clinical examination, and computed tomography within 6 hrs after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Mechanical ventilation was instituted with one or more of the following conditions: deterioration of consciousness with the inability to protect the airway; PaO2 of &lt;60; P(<z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi>) of &gt;60 mm Hg; breath rate of &gt;40 breaths/min; and left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018801" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart insufficiency</z:e> with definitive or impending <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mechanical ventilation was indicated for 52 (24%) of the 218 patients: in 47 (90%) patients because of deterioration of consciousness, and in five (10%) patients because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018801" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart insufficiency</z:e> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a logistic regression model, the history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and a size of infarction exceeding two thirds of the middle cerebral artery territory were independent variables for the application of mechanical ventilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 3 months, 42 (81%) of these 52 patients had died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was fatal midbrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> caused by complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients who survived had a good-to-fair outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: New therapeutic strategies (e.g., hemicraniectomy) must be developed to reduce mortality and improve the outcome for this subgroup of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mechanical ventilation is and will remain a crucial element within such new concepts </plain></SENT>
