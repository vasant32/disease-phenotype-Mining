<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to evaluate the effects of reperfusion and craniectomy treatment at different time points after middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological outcome in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used an endovascular technique to obtain <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in 182 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirteen groups with 14 animals each were investigated: control group 1 with no treatment; groups 2 to 7 with only reperfusion or craniectomy at 1, 4, or 12 hours, respectively; and groups 8 to 13 with reperfusion at 1 or 4 hours combined with craniectomy at 1, 4, or 12 hours, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological performance as study end points in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals at day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neurological score and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in animals undergoing early reperfusion at 1 hour were significantly smaller (1.8/79+/-59 mm3) than those in control animals (3.8/225+/-26 mm3) (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion at 4 hours (2.8/182+/-62 mm3) and 12 hours (3.7/231+/-69 mm3) did not result in significant improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals undergoing craniectomy at 1, 4, and 12 hours demonstrated significantly better outcome and significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (1.6/96+/-30 mm3, 1.9/109+/-39 mm3, and 2.6/150+/-34 mm3, respectively) (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with 1 treatment at a time, combined reperfusion and craniectomy did not result in a significant additional benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early reperfusion and craniectomy at 1 hour are both effective in large <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While reperfusion later than 1 hour was not beneficial, late craniectomy at 4 and 12 hours still resulted in significant improvement of neurological score and reduction of infarction size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Combined treatment at different time points yields no significant additional benefit compared with 1 treatment at a time </plain></SENT>
