<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were selected based on neurological examination and on CT scans showing both (1) infarction limited to the vascular territory and (2) involvement of posterior portion of superior temporal gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Waveforms recorded from C3, Cz, and C4 were examined for peak latency and amplitude of P1 and N1 on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Topographic displays of amplitude over P1 and N1 latency ranges were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath>, P1 was identified in 9 of the 10 subjects at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three electrode sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients, P1 was identified at C3 in only 1 of the 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>N1 was present at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three electrodes in the 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and in 5 of the 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining patient had N1 at C4 and Cz only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Examination of amplitude topology showed as asymmetric evolution of P1 and N1 in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This asymmetry was not present in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of this study are consistent with theory that P1 arises from primary auditory cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Results further suggest multiple generators for N1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additional study correlating topographic display from multichannel recordings with CT or MRI in brain-injured patients may bring more insight into N1 generators </plain></SENT>
