<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study was made of neonates in whom focal arterial infarction had been detected ultrasonographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A detailed study was made of cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty infarctions, with the exception of those in a posterior cerebral artery, were detected ultrasonographically over a period of 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most were confirmed by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Factor V Leiden heterozygosity was documented in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was probably antepartum in three, and associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015930" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal distress</z:e> before labour in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 19 cases of cortical middle cerebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The truncal type (n=13) was more common than complete (n = 5) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of six <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the anterior trunk, four were in term infants and five affected the right hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were part of the anterior truncal presentation in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One of these infants, with involvement of the primary motor area, developed a severe motor hemisyndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The Bayley Mental Developmental Index was above 80 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of three infants tested with anterior truncal infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of seven patients with posterior truncal infarction, six were at or near term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Six of these lesions were left sided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were observed in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A mild motor hemisyndrome developed in at least three of these infants due to involvement of parieto-temporal non-primary cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Inability to differentiate between truncal and complete middle cerebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is one of the explanations for the reported different outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Severe motor hemisyndrome can be predicted from neonatal ultrasonography on the basis of primary motor cortex involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were recognised in less than half of the patients with truncal infarction; left sided presentation was present in the posterior, but not the anterior truncal type of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Asphyxia is a rare cause of focal arterial infarction </plain></SENT>
