<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early identification of patients at risk is necessary to decide on invasive therapies such as decompressive hemicraniectomy or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess potential predictors of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> by measurement of intracranial pressure (ICP) and microdialysis in patients with large hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and different clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In an ongoing prospective clinical study, an ICP and microdialysis probe were placed into the parenchyma of the ipsilateral frontal lobe of 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Extracellular concentrations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> were measured continuously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Repeated cranial CT scans were scrutinized for size of infarction and presence of mass effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The dynamics of the different substances varied in accordance with the clinical course, size of infarction, and local <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>: Increase in ICP and in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> concentration and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> ratio was followed by massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>; generally low and stable ICP and substrate concentrations were found in patients without progressive space-occupying <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with large hemispheric infarction, bedside monitoring with microdialysis is feasible and might be helpful together with ICP recording to follow the development of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
