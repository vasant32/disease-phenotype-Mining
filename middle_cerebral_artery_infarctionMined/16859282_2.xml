<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> has been reported to be effective in the treatment of postischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> on cerebral hemodynamics is a matter of controversial discussion in literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies have yet to be performed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> after induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Measurements during mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (33-34 degrees C) were made in six patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> involving the middle cerebral artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>Hypothermia</z:hpo> was induced as soon as possible and maintained for 48 to 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) were estimated by a new double-indicator dilution method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measurements of CBF were made during normothermia, immediately after induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, at the end of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, and after rewarming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 19 measurements of CBF and jugular bulb O2 saturation were made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immediately after induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, CBF decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During late <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, CBF improved in patients who survived but remained diminished in the two patients who died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reduced CMRO2 levels were observed during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> phases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary oberservations indicate that moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> seems to reduce CMRO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Immediately after induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, CBF may decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During late <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> CBF seems to recover in patients with good outcome but remains diminished in patients who die </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Serial bedside CBF measurements with the new double-indicator dilution technique may be useful to describe cerebral hemodynamic characteristics in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
