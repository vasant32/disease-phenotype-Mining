<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the pharmacokinetics of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> in brain tissue by cerebral microdialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients experiencing large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> were included in this prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following variables were assessed before and every 10 minutes until 80 minutes after intravenous administration of 25 g of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi>: intracranial pressure (ICP), serum osmolarity, and cerebral microdialysate concentrations of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 16 ICP crises in 7 patients, cerebral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> concentrations (baseline 73.9+/-17.0 micromol/L) increased immediately after <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> administration by up to 350% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, ICP (baseline 25+/-2.4 mm Hg) rapidly decreased by almost 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both effects lasted for 70 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum osmolarity (baseline 305+/-5.6 mOsm/L) was only briefly raised, whereas <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> remained unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with intravenous <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> has only a brief effect on plasma osmolarity, but a more sustained effect on ICP, which is, however, accompanied by a rapid <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> accumulation in brain tissue </plain></SENT>
