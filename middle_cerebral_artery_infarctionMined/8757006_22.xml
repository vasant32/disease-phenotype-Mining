<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic trials of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) territory involves decision-making when the CT may not show obvious ischemic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed 100 consecutive patients, admitted within 14 hours after a first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Selective criteria were clinical presentation with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and at least two CTs (1 initial and 1 control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> CTs were retrospectively analyzed by at least two physicians blinded to the patient's status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the first CT, early signs were hyperdense <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> sign (HMCAS), early parenchymatous signs (attenuation of the lentiform nucleus [ALN], loss of the insular ribbon [LIR], and hemispheric sulcus effacement [HSE]), midline shift, and early infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> locations were classified according to total, partial superficial (superior or inferior), deep, or multiple <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical features, etiology, and Rankin scale were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 52 women (mean age 70.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The CTs were performed at mean 6.4 hours (1 to 14 hours) and before the sixth hour in 62% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Early CT was abnormal in 94% of the cases, and the abnormalities found were an HMCAS in 22 patients, ALN in 48, LIR in 59, HSE in 69, midline shift in 5, and early <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CT was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in six patients where it was performed earliest (mean 4.5 hours) and in the oldest patients (mean age 80.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Early parenchymatous CT signs were significantly associated with subsequent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> location and extension: ALN and deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, HSE and superficial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, LIR and large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>HMCAS was never found in isolation and was always associated with the three other signs in extended <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The presence of two or three signs (ALN, LIR, or HSE) was associated with extended <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (p &lt; 0.001) and poor outcome (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that CT frequently discloses parenchymal abnormalities during the first hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Early signs allow the prediction of subsequent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> locations; CT may provide a simple tool in evaluating the early prognosis of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction and thus may be useful in selecting better treatments </plain></SENT>
