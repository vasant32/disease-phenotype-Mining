<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The crossed cerebellar diaschisis was defined as significant when the laterality ratio of cerebral oxygen metabolism between the left and right cerebellar hemispheres exceeded the control range (mean +/- 2 standard deviations) as derived from 27 age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significant crossed cerebellar diaschisis was observed in 31 patients (89%) on the initial PET studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these 31 patients, 23 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> involving the frontal sensorimotor cortex persistently had crossed cerebellar diaschisis up to 5 years after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, whereas the diaschisis disappeared in 8 patients with smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> mainly in the frontal or parietal lobe without recovery of oxygen metabolism in the infarcted areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These present results suggest that crossed cerebellar diaschisis can exist persistently even in the late stage in those having a lesion involving the cortical pontine-cerebellar pathways </plain></SENT>
