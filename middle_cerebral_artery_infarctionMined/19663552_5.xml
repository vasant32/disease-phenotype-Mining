<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is increasingly used in the treatment of patients with malignant middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, neurological deterioration may exist independent from intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to present the findings of continuous ICP monitoring in a cohort of patients with malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction and to correlate these findings with clinical and radiological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors studied a prospective cohort of 25 patients with malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction consecutively admitted to the neurotrauma intensive care unit of the Vall d'Hebron University Hospital between March 2002 and September 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were treated using a combined protocol of initial moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> and hemicraniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latter was performed when patients showed a midline shift (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MLS</z:e>) &gt; or = 5 mm or ICP &gt; 20 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients had an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MLS</z:e> &gt; or = 5 mm on the first CT scan and underwent surgery without prior ICP monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study focuses on the subgroup of 19 patients who underwent intraparenchymatous ICP monitoring before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intracranial pressure readings were evaluated and correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000615'>pupillary abnormalities</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MLS</z:e>, and ischemic tissue volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 12 of the 19 patients, ICP values were always &lt; or = 20 mm Hg, despite a mean (+/- SD) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MLS</z:e> of 6.7 +/- 2 mm and a mean ischemic tissue volume of 241.3 +/- 83 cm(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009916'>anisocoria</z:hpo>, ICP values were also <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with a malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000615'>pupillary abnormalities</z:hpo> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002512'>brainstem compression</z:hpo> may be present despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ICP values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, continuous ICP monitoring cannot substitute for close clinical and radiological follow-up in the management of these patients </plain></SENT>
