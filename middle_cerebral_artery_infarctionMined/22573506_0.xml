<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To present the experience in daily practice after implantation of a clinical protocol of DC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective register of patients with MIMCA treated with DC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity -National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score-, basal characteristics, delay until DC, mortality, modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at three and twelve months and questionnaire of satisfaction are recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From February 2008 to December 2010, 15 patients were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean age: 60 years (range: 35-69); basal NIHSS, median (p25/p75): 17 (15.5/21), NIHSS before craniectomy: 20 (18/23.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DC was performed within 48 hours in 8 patients (53.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>5 subjects (33.3%) died during in-hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mortality was 25% among those treated within 48 hours and 42.9% among those treated later and 37.5% among patients &lt;= 60 years vs 28.6% in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> survivors scored &lt;= 4 in the mRS at three months and expressed satisfaction with surgery despite sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rate of favourable outcome (mRS &lt;= 3) was higher among patients under 60 (63%) and among those treated before 48 h (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DC is safe in clinical practice and reduces mortality after MIMCA, especially if it is performed within 48 hours from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Benefit appears to be greater in younger patients, but older people may benefit also </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The decision to perform DC should be made on an individual basis </plain></SENT>
