<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aims were to determine the mortality and long-term morbidity of such infants and identify risk factors for adverse outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The outcomes of 43 of 45 infants born at term consecutively requiring mechanical ventilation were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The infants had: meconium <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> syndrome (n = 11), hypoxic ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (HIE) (n = 11), respiratory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (n = 12), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> (n = 5), persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> of the newborn (n = 3) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven infants developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (26%), 13 (30%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>abnormal electroencephalograms</z:hpo> and 11 (26%) had abnormal MRI scans; 26% had an adverse outcome: six died, and five had severe neurodisability at 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The infants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040560" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital toxoplasmosis</z:e> and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> were excluded from the prediction analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 41 patients, requirement for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsants</z:chebi> (relative risk, RR = 4.44, 95% CI = 1.48 to 12.70; p = 0.014) and prolonged ventilation (longer than 3 days) (RR 4.83, 95% CI 1.51 to 15.64) predicted adverse outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Infants with HIE had an increased risk of adverse outcome (relative risk 5.45, 95% CI 1.01 to 33.85), but an adverse outcome occurred in infants with other diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Mortality and neurodisability at follow-up were common in infants born at term without major congenital anomalies who required mechanical ventilation in the first 24 h after birth, particularly in those who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> requiring treatment and prolonged ventilation </plain></SENT>
