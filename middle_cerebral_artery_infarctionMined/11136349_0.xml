<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Repeated cranial computerized tomography scan examination in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> is time consuming and requires patient transportation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively evaluated the diagnostic value of transcranial duplex sonography as a bedside tool for detection of the mass effect after space-occupying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and brain haemorrhage and for evaluating the width and dislocation of the ventricular system and the dislocation of brain mid-line structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used transcranial duplex sonography in 21 consecutive patients with space-occupying ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> and brain haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The transcranial duplex sonography examinations were performed within 2 h before or after corresponding follow-up cranial computerized tomography scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We measured the third ventricular width as a parameter for infratentorial and the mid-line shift for supratentorial space-occupying effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, mid-line structures could be identified by transcranial duplex sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant third ventricular dilation was found subsequently in most patients with infratentorial mass effect, and mid-line shift occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with supratentorial space-occupying lesions, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean difference (absolute values) between transcranial duplex sonography and cranial computerized tomography measurements was 0.8 mm for the ventricular width (standard deviation 1 mm) and 1.1 mm for the mid-line shift (standard deviation: 1.46 mm), with a tendency for these parameters to be underestimated at higher values using transcranial duplex sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The linear correlation coefficients were R = 0.97 and R = 0.94, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transcranial duplex sonography appears to be a sufficiently reliable bedside method for evaluating the width and the lateral displacement of the third ventricle, as validated by cranial computerized tomography scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, it may be suitable for monitoring the space-occupying effect of both supra- and infratentorial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> during treatment on critical care and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> units </plain></SENT>
