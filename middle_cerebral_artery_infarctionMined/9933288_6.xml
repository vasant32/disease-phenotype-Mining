<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Microdialysis is a method for neurochemical monitoring that has been applied more frequently over the past few years in patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain injury, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is used to study the course of extracellular molecules of low molecular weight, such as excitatory amino acids or metabolic end products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 43-year-old patient suffering from left hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with a space-occupying postischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> leading to a considerable mass effect on the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For treatment of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> was initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The microdialysis and intracranial pressure probe were placed into the noninfarcted hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A massive increase in levels of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="31" ids="17754">glycerine</z:chebi>, and the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> ratio was measured 24 hours before intracranial pressure elevation was observed and brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring excitatory amino acids, <z:chebi fb="31" ids="17754">glycerine</z:chebi> as a membrane component, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> ratio as an energy marker by microdialysis is a useful tool to increase our understanding of biochemical events in secondary brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For future prevention of secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in patients with massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, close neurochemical monitoring might be valuable to improve therapy, particularly in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> </plain></SENT>
