<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> has been reported to impair bilateral hand grasp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Individuals (5 males and 5 females; age 33-86 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> unilateral middle cerebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (4 right lesions and 6 left lesions) repeatedly lifted a 260-g object </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were then trained to lift the object using visuomotor feedback via an oscilloscope that displayed their actual grip force (GF) and a target GF, which roughly matched the physical properties of the object </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The subjects failed to accurately modulate the predictive GF when relying on somatosensory information from the previous lifts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Instead, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the lifts, they programmed excessive GF equivalent to the force used for the first lift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The predictive GF was lowered for lifts following the removal of the visual feedback </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean difference in predictive GF between the lifts before and after visual training was significant (4.35 +/- 0.027 N; P &lt;or= .001; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.80-4.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After removal of visual feedback, there was also a significant mean difference in the applied predictive GF between the "early" and "late" lifts (0.78 +/- 0.029 N; P &lt;or= .006; 95% CI = 0.22-1.35), demonstrating continued increase in predictive GF accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Predictive or feedforward fingertip force generation is impaired in the ipsilesional hand when lifting a novel object with precision grip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reacquisition of the motor forces for the grasp of objects is possible after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Potentially, retraining grasp control for the ipsilesional hand may translate to improved function and motor learning within the contralesional hand </plain></SENT>
