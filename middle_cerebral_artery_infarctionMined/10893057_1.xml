<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate the functional prognostic value of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy performed within the 5 days of an infarction of the middle cerebral artery territory, compared with previously demonstrated prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed on 77 consecutive non-comatosed patients during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The functional status was determined for each patient via the Orgogozo score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic data were acquired in the infarction and in contra-lateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue and the results were expressed as metabolite ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correlations were evaluated between the Orgogozo score at day 1 and day 30, the age, the sex, the volume of the infarction, and the metabolic ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In a monovariate analysis, the decrease of the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> ratio was correlated with a low Orgogozo score at days 1 and 30 (P&lt;0.05) and with a large infarction (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A stepwise analysis showed a significant relationship between the Orgogozo score at day 30 and the Orgogozo score at day 1, the sex, the volume of infarction, and the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cho ratio within the infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our work demonstrates that a good clinical outcome at day 30 depends on a good initial clinical score at day 1, a small volume of infarction, a small decrease of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cho, and being of the female gender </plain></SENT>
