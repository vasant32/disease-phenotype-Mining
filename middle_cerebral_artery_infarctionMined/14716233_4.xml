<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-seven patients diagnosed with a hyperacute <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who had an initial National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score greater than 10 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiphasic perfusion CT was performed within 6 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into 2 groups: the malignant group (n = 11), composed of patients who died within 7 days, and the nonmalignant group, which included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other patients (n = 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unenhanced CT and CT perfusion maps were assessed and compared between the 2 groups with special emphasis on examining the CT findings, including hyperdense <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> sign, large (greater than two-thirds) hypoattenuation and hypoperfusion in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory, and hypoattenuation in the basal ganglia and other vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of large hypoattenuation (greater than two-thirds of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory) on unenhanced CT and large hypoperfusion on CT perfusion maps differed significantly between the 2 groups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Large hypoperfusion on the CT total perfusion map was most accurate (93%) among various CT findings for the prediction of malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction with high sensitivity (91%), specificity (94%), and positive predictive value (91%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of large hypoperfusion on a CT perfusion map was higher in the malignant group than the nonmalignant group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CT perfusion maps may provide added information about cerebral perfusion and could be a useful predictor of malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction </plain></SENT>
