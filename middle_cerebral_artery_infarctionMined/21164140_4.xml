<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is unknown whether endogenous UA also influences the response to thrombolysis in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 317 consecutive patients treated with thrombolysis were included in a prospective <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographics, laboratory data, neurological course, and infarction volume were prospectively collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Excellent outcome was defined as achieving a modified Rankin Scale score &lt;2 at 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Binary and ordinal logistic regression models were used to analyze modified Rankin Scale score at 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: UA levels were significantly higher in patients with an excellent outcome than in patients with a poor outcome (5.82 [1.39] versus 5.42 [1.81], P=0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate models, increased UA levels (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.49; P=0.025) were associated with an excellent outcome and with an increased risk of shifting to a better category across the modified Rankin Scale (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.38; P=0.014) independently of the effect of confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The levels of UA and the volume of final infarction were inversely correlated (r=-0.216, P&lt;0.001) and the inverse correlation remained after adjustment for age, sex, and baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score (t value=-2.54, P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significantly lower UA levels were found in patients with malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> and parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> post-thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased UA serum levels are associated with better outcome in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treated with reperfusion therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results support the assessment of the potential neuroprotective role of the exogenous administration of UA in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treated with thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
