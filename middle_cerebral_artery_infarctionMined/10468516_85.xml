<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has long been a matter of debate whether recovery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> after left perisylvian lesions is mediated by the preserved left hemispheric language zones or by the homologous right hemisphere regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using PET, we investigated the short-term changes in the cortical network involved in language comprehension during recovery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 12 consecutive measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), four patients with Wernicke's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, caused by a posterior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751846" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">left middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e>, were tested with a language comprehension task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comprehension was estimated directly after each scan with a modified version of the Token Test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the interval between the scans, the patients participated in brief, intense language comprehension training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant improvement in performance was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We correlated changes in blood flow measured during the language comprehension task with the scores achieved in the Token Test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The regions which best correlated with the training-induced improvement in verbal comprehension were the posterior part of the right superior temporal gyrus and the left precuneus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study supports the role of the right hemisphere in recovery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> and demonstrates that the improvement in auditory comprehension induced by specific training is associated with functional brain reorganization </plain></SENT>
