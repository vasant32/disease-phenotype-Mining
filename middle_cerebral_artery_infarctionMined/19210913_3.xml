<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Decompressive surgery by a large hemicraniectomy with durotomy has been suggested as a life-saving emergency procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, because of the lack of established prognostic criteria, the fear of severe and "unacceptable" residual disability in surviving patients, and the impossibility of considering the opinion of the patient at the time of decision, there was no consensus regarding this surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recently the results of a pooled analysis of three European randomized trials (DECIMAL, DESTINY, and HAMLET) of early (&lt;/= 48 hours) decompressive large hemicraniectomy in patients less than 60 years of age showed that, compared with medical therapy alone, there was a 50% (95% CI, 33%-67%) absolute risk reduction (ARR) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, with more patients surviving with a slight to moderate disability (modified Rankin score of 2 or 3) (ARR of 23% ) or with a slight to moderately severe disability (modified Rankin score of 2, 3, or 4) (ARR of 51% ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>About 5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in each therapeutic group were left with a severe residual disability (Rankin 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that early decompressive hemicraniectomy should be considered and fully discussed with the relatives of selected patients with a malignant hemispheric infarction </plain></SENT>
