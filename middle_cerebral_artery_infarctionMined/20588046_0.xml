<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was already present in Charcot's first paper (1851), which dealt with a case of multiple organ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e>, at a time when the studies of Rudolf Virchow on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> were unknown in France </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A few years later, Charcot made a still up-to-date description of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0004417'>intermittent claudication</z:hpo>, which had only been reported in the horse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the 1860s, Charcot and his pupils presented several major works dealing with cerebrovascular disease, including famous studies on miliary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This work was done with Charles Bouchard, at the time Charcot's 'interne', but who would become one of his 'political' opponents 2 decades later, when in 1892, as president of the 'agrégation' jury, he rejected the professorship application of 4 protégés of Charcot, including Joseph Babinski and Georges <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040517" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="GTS">Gilles de la Tourette</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further work on cerebrovascular disease by Charcot included histological studies of brain 'softening', paraneoplastic cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> and consequences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (e.g. <z:hpo ids='HP_0003040'>arthropathies</z:hpo>, vegetative changes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001388'>abnormal movements</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain localization, one of Charcot's major neurological topics, was also largely based on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> case studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Charcot's work on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> remains poorly recognized, but it demonstrates his unique skills in stimulating scientific work in younger colleagues, many of whom subsequently became major figures of neurology and psychiatry </plain></SENT>
