<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective analysis with 3 months to 3 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University of Pittsburgh (Pa) Medical Center, a tertiary care university referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Four patients, aged 14 to 46 years, presented with focal neurologic deficits appropriate for a massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> (two dominant and two nondominant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In spite of medical therapy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients deteriorated to at least a decreased level of consciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Using <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-enhanced computed tomographic studies of cerebral blood flow in three patients, areas of severely ischemic (blood flow, &lt; 5 mL/100 g per minute), nonviable brain were identified and resected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OUTCOME MEASURE: Outcome was measured by survival and ability to perform activities of daily living </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postoperatively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients recovered rapidly (&lt; 6 hours) to the level of function at admission and were able to perform the activities of daily living with minimal or no assistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite deficits appropriate to the area of infarction, prompt management of life-threatening <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857175" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postinfarction</z:e> swelling by surgical decompression can yield favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
