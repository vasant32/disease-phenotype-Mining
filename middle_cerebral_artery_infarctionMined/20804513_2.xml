<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although decompressive craniectomy decreases mortality and leads to an acceptable outcome in selected adult patients, there are few data on MMCAI in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the frequency of MMCAI and the use of decompressive craniectomy in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We retrospectively reviewed cases of MMCAI from five pediatric tertiary care centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten children (two females, eight males; median age 9y 10mo, range 22mo-14y) had MMCAI, with a median Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score of 6 (range 3-9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MMCAI represented fewer than 2% of cases of pediatric arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients who did not undergo decompression, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had monitoring of intracranial pressure, developed intractable intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and fulfilled criteria for brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, seven patients underwent decompressive craniectomy and survived, with rapid improvement in their level of consciousness postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> seven survivors now walk independently with mild to moderate residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and speak fluently, even though four had left-sided <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Decompressive craniectomy can lead to a moderately good outcome for children with MMCAI and should be considered, even with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Monitoring of intracranial pressure may delay life-saving treatment </plain></SENT>
