<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients entered the study within 48 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and randomly received either nimodipine (2 mg/hr constant intravenous infusion for 5 days, 120 mg/day orally for another 16 days) or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four of the 27 patients died within the first 3 weeks and could not be evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 23 patients, 11 were assigned to the nimodipine group and 12 to a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed data from <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography, performed twice before and after completion of therapy, and clinical data from the treatment period and the next 6 months based on the Mathew Score for early assessment and the Barthel Index for late assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the post-treatment period, two patients from the nimodipine group and three from the control group died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The evaluated patients were comparable for age and sex distribution, initial clinical deficit, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found significant metabolic changes between both treatment groups for contralateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> mirror region, ipsilateral and contralateral cerebral gray matter, and contralateral and ipsilateral cerebellar hemispheres (side x region x treatment interaction p less than 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The nimodipine group had bilaterally increased regional cerebral metabolic rate of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> of morphologically intact cerebral (14.6% and 17.1%, respectively) and cerebellar structures (6.9% and 10%, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
