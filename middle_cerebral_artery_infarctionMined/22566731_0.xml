<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000709'>psychosis</z:hpo>, arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> have been reported in connection to khat abuse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present a case of a young man who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> left-sided <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He was a known khat addict for over three decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751849" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">right middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Detailed evaluation revealed no significant underlying cause for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since the main central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system effects of khat are comparable with those of <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamines</z:chebi> and there are established reports of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi> abuse, the former was assumed to be the etiological factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient was discontinued from taking khat and was managed conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The subject showed significant recovery with no further complications or similar episodes during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, this is the second case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> associated with khat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since the management is essentially conservative, a vigilant history eliciting of khat abuse in prevalent countries would cut down unnecessary healthcare costs </plain></SENT>
