<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Ultrasound (US) perfusion imaging of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> has mainly been applied to large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether small <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> involving the thalamus can also be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Phase inversion harmonic imaging (PIHI) was applied to patients with small infarctions involving the thalamus (maximal longitudinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> diameter less than 3 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PIHI was performed from both the left and right side in axial diencephalic planes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size and location as well as perfusion properties (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> maps) were known from MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>US perfusion parameters were derived from the signal enhancement time course (bolus kinetics, SonoVue for peak-signal increase and time-to-peak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen patients (52 +/- 11 years, 24% female) with 18 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (16 unilateral, 1 bilateral) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six US examinations (18%) were inadequate for analysis due to an insufficient transtemporal bone window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>US perfusion depicted 90 % of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> with a longitudinal diameter of more than 2 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> with a longitudinal diameter of less than 2 cm were hardly identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PIHI allows identification of a small infarction involving the thalamus subject to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
