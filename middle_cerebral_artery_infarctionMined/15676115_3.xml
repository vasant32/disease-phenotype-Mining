<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, several observational studies suggested normothermia or mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> as independent prognostic factors for favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> was only examined in one clinical study that showed its feasibility and safety, but was not powered to examine efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Limited clinical data on MH in humans suggest that this treatment probably reduces mortality in patients with malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Still, MH in humans is associated with several side effects, intensive medical treatment, and a prolonged stay in the neurologic intensive care unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Use of MH should be limited to specialized units, applying this treatment within research protocols or observational studies </plain></SENT>
