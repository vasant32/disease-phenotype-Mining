<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate a deficit in cerebral perfusion after administration of the contrast agent SonoVue (Bracco Altana Pharma, Konstanz, Germany) in patients with intracranial space-occupying lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used transcranial duplex sonography to examine 10 healthy volunteers and 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the patients, one 55-year-old woman had an intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100843'>glioblastoma</z:hpo>; one 54-year-old woman had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>; and one 49-year-old woman and one 69-year-old man had a malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A decompressive craniectomy was performed in the 2 patients with malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Triggered images with pulsing intervals of 1000 milliseconds were used for the evaluation of time-intensity curves in several regions of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mechanical index was set at 1.6; in patients with a craniectomy, the mechanical index was set at 1.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, the perfusion deficit could be recognized in the ipsilateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The superimposition of the sonographic images with those from computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging showed a good correspondence in shape and size in patients with a craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients without a craniectomy, a rough correspondence with findings from magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography could be recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: By using contrast-enhanced transcranial duplex sonography, it is possible to image the perfusion deficit in cerebral microcirculation in patients with intracranial space-occupying lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results should be confirmed by more pathologic cases and correlated with magnetic resonance imaging and other neuroimaging techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additionally, further technical development in sonographic systems is necessary to improve the diagnostics of cerebral perfusion deficit </plain></SENT>
