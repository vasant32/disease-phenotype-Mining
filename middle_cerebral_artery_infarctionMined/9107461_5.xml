<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analysed the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomographic (PET) findings in 28 patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, stable middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and in 22 controls, using the steady state technique and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="36932">15O</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Also, the Orgogozo scores on admission and at the time of the PET examination were compared in the patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on the asymmetry index and the 95% confidence limits for regional cerebellar blood flow (rCBF) and oxygen consumption (rCMRO2) in the control group, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were subdivided in a group with (n = 8) and a group without (n = 20) CCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CCD group had lower values of rCMRO2 in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and border areas compared to those of the non-CCD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> location within the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory was similar but the size was somewhat larger in the <z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The degree of neurological improvement was better in the non-CCD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although persistence of CCD has no real clinical significance it appears to be correlated to more severe and widespread <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> in the affected <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory and to the lack of significant clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
