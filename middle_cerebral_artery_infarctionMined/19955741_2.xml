<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we applied spectral EEG analysis to determine the prognosis early after hemicraniectomy, while the patient is still treated in the intensive care unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Continuous EEG monitoring following hemicraniectomy was performed in 10 patients with space-occupying <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were analgosedated and mechanically ventilated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first 6 h of monitoring after surgery were evaluated by spectral analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures included Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), Level of Consciousness Scale (LOC) and National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcome after 3 months was assessed by modified Rankin Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six patients displayed a peak at 5-10 Hz in the EEG power spectrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these patients had a GOS score of 3 and an LOC score &gt;or=7 at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the 4 patients without faster EEG activity had a GOS of 2 and LOC &lt;or=6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>GOS (r = 1, p &lt; 0.001), LOC (r = 0.89, p = 0.001) and NIHSS (r = -0.8; p &lt; 0.01) at discharge significantly correlated with the presence of 5- to 10-Hz activity, but not with age, time to hemicraniectomy, duration of hospital stay or baseline NIHSS scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Outcome after 3 months significantly correlated with age (r = 0.67; p &lt; 0.05) and the presence of faster EEG activity (r = -0.76; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Spectral analysis in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase following hemicraniectomy may represent a parameter to predict early regain of consciousness and thus the capability and potential for further rehabilitation and favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
