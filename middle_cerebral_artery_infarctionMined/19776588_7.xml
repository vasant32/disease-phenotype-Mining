<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the utility of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to determine cerebral perfusion in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven patients were investigated within 1.4 +/- 2.2 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of an ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> by monitoring the kinetics of an intravenous bolus of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> (ICG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For ICG kinetics, bolus peak time, time to peak (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> = time between 0 and 100% ICG maximum), maximum ICG concentration, rise time (time between 10 and 90% ICG maximum), slope (maximum ICG/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>), and blood flow index (BFI = maximum ICG/rise time) were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI) and NIRS measurements were performed within 24 h, and the interhemispherical differences of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> values were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> patients showed an increased bolus peak time (p &lt; 0.02), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.01), and rise time (p &lt; 0.01), whereas slope (p &lt; 0.01) and BFI (p &lt; 0.01) were diminished at the site of infarction as compared to the unaffected hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The interhemispherical differences of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> as measured by PWI and NIRS were closely correlated (r = 0.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Noninvasive measurements of cerebral ICG kinetics by NIRS provide a useful means of detecting cerebral perfusion deficits in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which correlate well with those obtained by PWI </plain></SENT>
