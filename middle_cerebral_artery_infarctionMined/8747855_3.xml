<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty eight subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction and twenty two <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were studied with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET), using the steady state technique with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="36932">15O</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> patients were subdivided into a group with ITD (n = 12) and a group without ITD (n = 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with ITD had greater decreases of regional blood flow (rCBF) and oxygen consumption (rCMRO2) in the infarcted <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory, compared to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction without ITD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neurological deficits at the time of PET scanning were similar between both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extent of infarction by CT brain scan appeared more predominant in peri-insular regions of patients with ITD, while in non diaschisis patients <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were more widely distributed throughout the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Occurrence of ITD and of crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) did not correlate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Occurrence of ITD seems to be linked to diffuse reductions of blood flow and oxygen metabolism in cortical territories of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mechanisms of ITD were different from those of CCD </plain></SENT>
