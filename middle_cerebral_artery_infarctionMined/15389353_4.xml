<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although this palliative treatment form has gained popularity in Switzerland since 2000, the results of these series have not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is, firstly, to report factors influencing the outcome of our patients, in order to create awareness of the indications and decision-making processes in our departments, and, secondly, to analyse therapeutic strategies which are open to improvement and standardisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective study included a total of 28 patients (age 51 +/- 12 years) who underwent decompressive craniectomy after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> between January 2000 and May 2002 at the Departments of Neurosurgery of Aarau (n: 6), Bern (n: 10), and Zurich (n: 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic characteristics included preoperative clinical condition (NIHSS and GCS), timing of surgery, cause, location, and extension of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the time delay from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms to surgery and preoperative signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> and their relation to final outcome was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The final outcome was assessed in terms of mortality and scores such as modified Rankin scale and Barthel index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The preoperative clinical condition according to NIHSS was 20.2 +/- 4.7 and GCS was 10.6 +/- 3.6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean time in hours to surgery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms was 35 +/- 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients (42.8%) underwent "early" surgery (within 24 hours) and 21 (75%) suffered non-dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period was 22 +/- 13 months and 17% of the patients died within this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Outcome did not differ significantly between institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The overall mean Barthel index was 47 +/- 25 and modified Rankin scale was 4 +/- 1.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The outcome in patients undergoing decompressive craniectomy after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction in Switzerland is less favourable than in other series recently reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Less favourable preoperative clinical condition, inclusion of dominant hemispheric infarction, poorly defined protocols and late involvement of neurosurgeons on these patients' admission may explain the results </plain></SENT>
