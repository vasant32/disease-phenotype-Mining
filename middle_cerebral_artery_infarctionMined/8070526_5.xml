<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These alterations may represent an attempt of various neuronal systems to compensate for the reduction in innervation caused by the cortical infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Assessment of the receptor changes induced by cortical infarction define neuropharmacologic correlates of cortical damage, indicate possible <z:chebi fb="65" ids="25512">neurotransmitters</z:chebi> associated with neuroanatomically defined subcortical pathways, and suggest possible pharmacologic interventions to counteract the consequences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bilateral cortical infarction, induced by ligation of both middle cerebral arteries and temporary occlusion of both common carotid arteries, was investigated in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The infarction resulted in dramatic alterations in subcortical receptor populations as determined by autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">Sodium</z:chebi>-dependent, high-affinity, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi>-uptake (SDHACU) sites and D1-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> receptors in the caudate putamen were unaffected by the infarction, whereas muscarinic and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptors were increased and D2 receptors were decreased in this structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A reduction in SDHACU sites caused by the lesion was found in regions including the medial septum, vertical nucleus of the diagonal band, thalamus, nucleus basalis magnocellularis, and basolateral amygdala </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>M1 receptors were increased in the basolateral and central amygdaloid nuclei whereas non-M1 receptors were increased in the basolateral and central amygdaloid nuclei, but were diminished in the medial septum, vertical nucleus of the diagonal band, thalamus, and nucleus basalis magnocellularis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant alterations in muscarinic binding were observed in the various laminae of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus </plain></SENT>
