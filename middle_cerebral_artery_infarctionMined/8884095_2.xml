<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> and SSEP within 4 days and after 6 weeks and 3 months of the infarction and assessed clinical improvement by using the Barthel index (BI) and the Rankin scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The localization and extent of the infarction was investigated by CT scanning or NMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> parameters were correlated to clinical outcome and the prognostic significance of each parameter in addition to BI was determined </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in stepwise regression analysis using <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parameters simultaneously, only <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> and age significantly contributed to clinical outcome in addition to BI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients showed a better outcome when their <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or delayed, measured within 4 days of the infarction, compared to patients with absent <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was better at a younger age </plain></SENT>
