<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Despite appropriate therapy with intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a significant proportion of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) infarction continue to suffer residual disability or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic use of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) concomitantly with IV tPA is speculated to increase recanalization rates and improve clinical outcomes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To critically appraise the evidence concerning the safety and efficacy of the simultaneous delivery of IV tPA and continuous TCD monitoring as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> therapy in patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The objective was addressed through the development of a structured, critically appraised topic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This incorporated a clinical scenario, background information, a structured question, literature search strategy, results, critical appraisal, clinical bottom line, and expert commentary from vascular neurology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In a multicenter phase II randomized controlled study, 126 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were randomized to receive treatment with IV tPA and continuous TCD monitoring or placebo monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete recanalization or dramatic clinical recovery within 2 hours after the administration of a tPA bolus occurred in 31 patients in the target group (49%), as compared with 19 patients in the control group (30%); P=0.03 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 3 months, of the patients eligible for follow-up, 22 of 53 (42%) in the target group and 14 of 49 (29%) in the control group had favorable outcomes; P=0.20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> were noted in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic use of continuous TCD monitoring concomitantly with IV tPA increases recanalization rates in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> relative to treatment with IV tPA alone without increasing the complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
