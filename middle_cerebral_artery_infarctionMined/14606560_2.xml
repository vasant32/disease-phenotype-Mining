<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early monitoring of intracranial pressure and application of necessary treatment procedures may have life-saving value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the data obtained by transcranial Doppler sonography were compared with clinical examination and the neuroradiologic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen patients with first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> who were admitted within the first 12 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical findings were evaluated according to the daily Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale and Rankin disability scores on the 10th day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Initial cerebral computed tomography was performed at admission to the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Midline shift and ventricular displacement were evaluated on the third day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up tomographic scans of some patients were performed on subsequent days if necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Systolic, diastolic, and mean blood flow velocities and pulsatility indices of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were measured by transcranial Doppler sonography daily for 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The pulsatility indices were higher on the third hospital day than on the first day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The increases in the pulsatility indices were correlated with the midline shift measured on the third day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The prognoses of the patients whose maximal pulsatility indices during the first 10 days were higher than 1.5 were poorer than those of the patients whose maximal pulsatility indices were lower than 1.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transcranial Doppler sonography enables noninvasive monitoring of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> in patients with large infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It also provides information for detecting cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> and deciding on the medical or surgical therapy </plain></SENT>
