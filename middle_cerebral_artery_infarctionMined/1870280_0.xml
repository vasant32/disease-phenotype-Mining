<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A neuroradiological study of crossed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001272'>cerebellar atrophy</z:hpo> (CCA) was performed using X-ray CT in 103 patients suffering from unilateral supratentorial cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CCA was demonstrated in 9 (8.7%) of 103 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No difference between the occurrence of CCA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> and that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CCA was seen in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage of cerebrovascular disease more than 3 years since <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurrence, and was found to be present more frequently and to a greater extent 7 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No correlation between the site of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and the occurrence of CCA was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Trans-synaptic degeneration of the corticopontocerebellar tract was considered in CCA following putaminal and combined <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> involving an internal capsule lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in thalamic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, retrograde degeneration within the cerebellorubrothalamic tract was presumed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CCA following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was seen in patients with massive lesions in the territory of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that lesions of the parietal and frontal lobes appeared to greatly contribute to the development of CCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As the degeneration and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in the thalamus on the side of the lesion appeared early and frequently, it was suggested that retrograde degeneration of the cerebellorubrothalamic tract participated, in addition to anterograde corticopontocerebellar tract degeneration, in CCA following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is likely that CCA is caused by both transsynaptic degeneration of the corticopontocerebellar tract and the cerebellorubrothalamic tract </plain></SENT>
