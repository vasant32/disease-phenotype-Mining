<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although computed tomography (CT) remains the most frequently used imaging examination in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, its sensitivity for early detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> remains limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> less than 6 hours old, loss of definition of the gray-white interface in the lateral margins of the insula ("insular ribbon") was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> CT findings in 11 retrospective and 16 prospective patients are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Loss of the insular ribbon was detected in 12 of the prospective cases and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 11 retrospective cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The insular ribbon is supplied by the insular segment of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and its claustral branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With cessation of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> flow, the insular ribbon becomes the region most distal from the anterior and posterior cerebral collateral circulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the insular ribbon effectively becomes a watershed arterial zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Loss of the insular ribbon is thus a reflection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> due to infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Loss of the insular ribbon appears to be another frequent and reliable finding in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
