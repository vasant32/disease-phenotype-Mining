<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the reliability of detecting signs of hemispheric infarction on CT scans obtained within 6 hours of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A neuroradiologist selected 12 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and 33 abnormal CT studies showing the hyperdense middle cerebral artery sign (HMCAS) (n = 10), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> (n = 22), and parenchymal hypodensity (n = 33) from two series of 750 patients with recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of middle cerebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These selections served as the reference source for a nonblinded analysis of the initial and follow-up CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six neuroradiologists then reviewed the CT scans twice, first blinded then not blinded to clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They assessed the signs of infarction for each hemisphere separately and estimated the volume of abnormal parenchymal hypodensity in increments of 20% within the territory of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Unblinding the reviewers did not change interobserver agreement significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The chance adjusted agreement was moderate to substantial: kappa = .62 (95% confidence interval [CI], .46 to .78) and kappa = .57 (95% CI, .33 to .81) for the HMCAS of the right and left hemisphere, respectively; kappa = .59 (95% CI, .47 to .71) and kappa = .56 (95% CI, .38 to .74) for focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> of the right and left hemisphere, respectively; and kappa = .58 (95% CI, .50 to .66) and kappa = .55 (95% CI, .32 to .67) for parenchymal hypodensity of the right and left hemisphere, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Weighted kappa was .65 and .57 for the estimation of the hypodense tissue volume in the right and left hemisphere, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Agreement with the reference source ranged from 73% to 93% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> variables and both hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Even with no clinical information, neuroradiologists can assess subtle CT signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> within the first 6 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> with moderate to substantial interobserver agreement </plain></SENT>
