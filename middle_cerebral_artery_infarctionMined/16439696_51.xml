<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were examined by perfusion-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging &lt; or =6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within 3 hours, patients were treated according to Second European-Australasian <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Study (ECASS II) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 3 to 6 hours, treatment with IV-tPA was performed based on MRI findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Favorable outcome was assessed after 90 days using a dichotomized modified Rankin scale score of 0 to 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001916'>Intracerebral bleeding</z:mp> complications were assessed on follow-up MRI or computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were compared with the pooled placebo and pooled tPA patients of the ATLANTIS, ECASS, and National Institute of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> (NINDS) tPA trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 174 MRI-selected tPA patients, 62% (n=108) were treated in &lt; or =3 hours and 38% (n=66) after 3 to 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Favorable outcome was more frequent in MRI-selected tPA patients (48% [95% CI, 39 to 54]) compared with pooled placebo (33% [95% CI, 31 to 36]; P&lt;0.001) and pooled tPA patients (40% [95% CI, 37 to 42]; P=0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios for favorable outcome in the MRI-selected tPA group were 1.82 (1.32 to 2.51) compared with the pooled placebo and 1.39 (1.01 to 1.92) compared with the pooled tPA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rate of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> in MRI-selected tPA patients (3% [95% CI, 0 to 5]) was lower than in the pooled tPA group (8% [95% CI, 7 to 10]; P=0.012) and comparable to the pooled placebo group (2% [95% CI, 1 to 3]; P=0.392) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study supports that it is safe and effective to expand the time window for IV-tPA up to 6 hours in patients with tissue at risk as defined by MRI </plain></SENT>
