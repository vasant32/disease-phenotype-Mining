<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to study the ischemic penumbra in humans by measuring the metabolic changes that occur after a middle cerebral artery territory infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Diagnostic MRI and short-echo time <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy were performed on a 1.5-T system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Localized proton <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy was performed within the area of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and in a homologous area of the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The residual water resonance in the spectra was removed with the use of the Hankel Lanczos singular value decomposition method, after which peak area estimates were obtained by means of the variable projection time domain fitting analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The unsuppressed water signal was used as an internal concentration standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> were studied within 28 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and followed up for a period of up to 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant changes were seen in the initial spectra from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> compared with the contralateral spectra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">Lactate</z:chebi>, a marker of anaerobic metabolism, was present within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> but not detected in the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">Acetyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi>, a neuronal marker, and total <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> were significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The initial <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> signal, arising from <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi>-containing compounds within the cell and cell membrane, remained unchanged in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core compared with the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further reductions in N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> and total <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> concentrations occurred within the first week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A fall in the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> concentration was seen within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core during the first 7 to 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Similar reductions in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> concentration were observed during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The demonstration of the continuing loss of cerebral metabolites within an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region suggests that further cell loss occurs up to 10 days after infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The continuing loss of neurons may represent continued ischemic damage after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
