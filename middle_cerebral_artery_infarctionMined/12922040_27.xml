<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Early surgical decompressive craniectomy (less than 24 hours) for malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) provides life-saving benefits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Detection of the infarction territory with computed tomography (CT) scan is usually less sensitive and delayed than diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) that is capable of defecting the infarction territory in as little as 5 minutes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on the DWI and clinical neurologic evaluations, ultra-early (less than 6 hours) decompressive craniectomy for malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction may be very helpful in improving mortality and morbidity rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We treated 52 patients with malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical neurologic presentation was evaluated using the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) and the Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale (GCS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The infarction territory was evaluated by either DWI or CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into three groups (Group A: ultra-early, Group B: craniectomy beyond 6 hours, and Group C: no operation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anterior temporal lobectomy was performed according to the ICP levels (ICP &gt;30 mm Hg) after decompressive craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Group A had statistically lower mortality rates than Groups B and C (8.7% in Group A, 36.7% in Group B and 80% in Group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Group A patients also had better prognosis of conscious recovery on the 7th day of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (91.7% in Group A, 55% in Group B and 0% in Group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Group A had statistically better Barthel Indexes than Group B, p &lt; 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Group A and Group B had better GOS levels than Group C, p &lt; 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis by CT was accurate in only 33% of patients while the accuracy of DWI to detect malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction was 100% within 6 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In surgical Group A and B, thirteen patients underwent anterior temporal lobectomy, and 67% survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with ICP levels of more than 30 mm Hg who did not undergo further anterior temporal lobectomy died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients who underwent decompressive surgery had better outcomes than patients who did not have the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Ultra-early intervention with decompressive craniectomy with ICP monitoring before neurologic conditions become worse may reduce the mortality rate, increase the conscious recovery rate, and improve neurologic sequels for malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>DWI with clinical neurologic evaluation (NIHSS, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>, down-hill GCS) provides for early diagnosis and treatment of malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Anterior temporal lobectomy may further reduce intraoperative ICP and reduce mortality, especially when the infarction is at multiple arterial territories </plain></SENT>
