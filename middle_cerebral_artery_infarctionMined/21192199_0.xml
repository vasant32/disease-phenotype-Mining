<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether adjunctive surgical therapy improves clinical outcomes has long been a controversial topic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: to determine whether surgical decompression, compared with best medical management, improves mortality and morbidity in the setting of a large territory <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: the objective was addressed through the development of a structured critically appraised topic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This included development of a clinical scenario, structured clinical questions, search strategy and selection of an article, critical appraisal, evidence summary, clinical bottom lines, and expert commentary from vascular neurologists and a vascular neurosurgeon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: the study selected for appraisal included data from both a multicenter randomized trial and an updated meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgical decompression within 4 days of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> did not reduce the risk of poor outcome [absolute risk reduction (ARR), 0%; 95% confidence interval (CI), -21% to 21%]; however, it did reduce case fatality (ARR, 38%; 95% CI, 15% to 60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The updated meta-analysis showed that surgical decompression within 48 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> reduces both poor outcome [ARR, 42%; 95% CI, 23% to 56%; number needed to treat (NNT)=2; 95% CI, 2 to 4] and case fatality (ARR, 50%; 95% CI, 32% to 64%; NNT=2; 95% CI, 2 to 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: early surgical decompression (within 48 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) reduces the risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and poor clinical outcome at 1 year in patients with large territory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
