<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to compare the neuropsychologic features of five sets of twins discordant for perinatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the affected children had unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> (two left, three right); four of the five <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were large-branch, affecting the entire M1 territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three of the five affected children had comorbid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measures of intelligence, memory, language, attention, executive function, visual-motor integration, and fine motor skills were administered to children at a median age of 5 years (range, 5-8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relative to their unaffected co-twins, the twins with perinatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> exhibited lower levels of full scale (p=0.005), verbal (p=0.006), and nonverbal (p=0.005) intelligence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Children with perinatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> also showed significant deficits on tests of verbal memory (p=0.041), receptive language (p=0.011), verbal fluency (p=0.019), and visual attention (p=0.011), compared with their unaffected co-twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twin gestation may be a risk factor for poor cognitive outcome after perinatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and comorbid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> may have contributed to some of the poor cognitive outcomes in this cohort </plain></SENT>
