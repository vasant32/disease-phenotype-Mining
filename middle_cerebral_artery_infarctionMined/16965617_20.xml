<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite maximal conservative treatment, the case fatality rate may be as high as 80%, and most survivors are left severely disabled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Non-randomised studies suggest that decompressive surgery reduces mortality substantially and improves functional outcome of survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study is designed to compare the efficacy of decompressive surgery to improve functional outcome with that of conservative treatment in patients with space-occupying supratentorial infarction METHODS: The study design is that of a multi-centre, randomised clinical trial, which will include 112 patients aged between 18 and 60 years with a large hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> with space-occupying <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> that leads to a decrease in consciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients will be randomised to receive either decompressive surgery in combination with medical treatment or best medical treatment alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Randomisation will be stratified for the intended mode of conservative treatment (intensive care or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit care) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure will be functional outcome, as determined by the score on the modified Rankin Scale, at one year </plain></SENT>
