<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of eubaric <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp> therapy by Venturi mask (VM) in a group of patients who experienced a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Patients experiencing a first-ever large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> were recruited within 48 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were subdivided to undergo therapy with a VM with a fraction of inspired oxygen of 40% or with a nasal cannula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> was defined as a large low-attenuation area of more than one third of the middle cerebral artery territory on brain images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> severity was evaluated by the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen patients were enrolled in the VM group and 29 in the nasal cannula group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the demographic and clinical characteristics were equally distributed initially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean initial National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score was 20.5 and 18.9 in the VM and nasal cannula groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was found in 11 (65%) patients in the VM and 17 (59%) patients in the nasal cannula groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The VM therapy was initiated within 13.7 (range, 3.0-41.5) hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the duration was 132.9 (range, 48.0-168.5) hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In-hospital mortality was 1 (6%) in the VM group and 7 (24%) in the nasal cannula group (P=.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the VM group, there were fewer incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (4 [24%] vs 15 [52%]; P=.06), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> (1 [6%] vs 6 [21%]; P=.18), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> (3 [18%] vs 8 [28%]; P=.45), but a higher incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011127" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bedsores</z:e> (3 [18%] vs 2 [7%]; P=.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: By using VM therapy with a fraction of inspired oxygen of 40%, there might be less mortality and comorbidities in treated patients who experienced a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further randomized confirmatory studies should explore the decreased mortality in patients who experience a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, especially in those with a large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> who undergo VM therapy with a fraction of inspired oxygen of 40% </plain></SENT>
