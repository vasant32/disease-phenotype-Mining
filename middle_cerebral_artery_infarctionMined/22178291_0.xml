<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and understand the influence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> on the functional outcome of patients undergoing decompressive craniectomy for malignant middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data of consecutive patients who underwent decompressive craniectomy for malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical and imaging data were reviewed to confirm the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and evaluate the impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> on functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The functional outcomes of patients were estimated with the Glasgow outcome score at 1year after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen patients who received decompressive craniectomy for malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction from January 2003 to December 2006 were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> developed in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The functional outcomes in these patients were uniformly poor regardless of cerebrospinal fluid diversion surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data revealed that functional outcome was related to patient age and the duration from infarction to craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> is common in patients who receive decompressive craniectomy for malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the shunt procedure does not significantly improve the patient's clinical condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The timing of operation in relation to the functional outcome may be critical </plain></SENT>
