<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine the survival rate and functional outcome, and factors associated with these, in patients with malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From January 2000 to December 2003, 60 patients with malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction were treated in our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients in the study underwent a large ipsilateral craniectomy and duroplasty for decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The infarction territory was evaluated by either diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical neurological presentation was evaluated using the Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was evaluated using the Barthel index (BI) and the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at follow-up 12 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-day mortality was 20% (12 patients) and 12-month mortality was 26.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The factors associated with higher mortality were age&gt;or=60 years, involvement of more than one vascular territory, presence of signs indicating clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> before surgery, and treatment more than 24 hours after ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean GOS score was 3.3+/-1.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean Barthel index was 65.1+/-40.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine (65.9%) patients had a favourable outcome (BI&gt;or=60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The factors associated with favourable outcome were age&lt;60 years and treatment within 24 hours of ictus, before clinical signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Decompressive hemicraniectomy should be performed in patients younger than 60 years within 24 hours of ictus before clinical signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> develop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Age, timing of surgery and clinical signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> are prognostic factors for mortality and functional outcome </plain></SENT>
