<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There are unsatisfactory therapeutic options for treatment of large infarctions of the middle cerebral artery with secondary development of life threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most cases, post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> can not be adequately treated by conservative means </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, several studies have shown that operative procedures such as decompressive hemicraniectomy can decrease mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Apart from mortality, the morbidity and quality of life are major features with which to estimate therapeutic benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to acquire follow-up data on quality of life and outcome in patients treated with hemicraniectomy after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen patients were treated with decompressive hemicraniectomy after life threatening <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> between July 1997 and April 2000 in our clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients (33 %) died within the first six months after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> twelve surviving patients were seen in a follow-up examination 7 to 26 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and tested using the Rankin-Scale, Barthel Index (BI), Aachener Life Quality Inventory (ALQI) and Zung Self-Rating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Survivors with a mean age of 40.7 +/- 16.5 years were significantly younger than non-survivors with a mean age of 64.5 +/- 9.2 years (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean Barthel-Index of surviving patients was 61.1 +/- 26.1 points, mean Rankin-Scale 3.3 +/- 1.2 points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients were able to return to work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients younger than 45 years (n = 7) had a significantly better outcome (BI 75.7 +/- 20.7) than patients over 45 years (n = 5) (BI 42.0 +/- 22.7 points, p = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among five patients with an infarction of the left hemisphere, four had a slight to moderate Broca <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> and one patient a global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Quality of life assessment by ALQI showed moderate disability (58.0 +/- 22.7 of 107 points) with no significant difference between left- and right-hemispheric infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Using the Zung Self-Rating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale six patients were ranked as slightly depressive, one patient as moderately depressive and five patients as not depressive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Eleven out of twelve survivors, as well as their relatives, approved of the decision to have the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study provides evidence that hemicraniectomy as treatment of severe space occupying ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> saves lives and results in good quality of life in a high proportion of patients, especially in the young </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This conclusion is restricted by the lack of a control group, which was deemed unethical in studying a potentially life saving therapy </plain></SENT>
