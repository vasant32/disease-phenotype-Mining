<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Hemicraniectomy in patients with malignant middle cerebral artery (mMCA) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> may be life-saving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The long-term prognosis is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with mMCA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> treated with hemicraniectomy between 1998 and 2002 at three hospitals were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The criterion for surgical intervention was if the patients deteriorated from awake to being responding to painful stimuli only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed for at least 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcome was defined as alive/dead, walkers/non-walkers or modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score &lt;or=2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty patients were included (median age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> 49 years, range 17-67 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had mMCA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> on the left side and 16 patients on the right side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had pupil <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hemicraniectomy was performed at a median of 52 h (range 13-235 h) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nine patients died within 1 month after surgery because of cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> (n = 6), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (n = 1) or intensive care complications (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No further <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred during follow-up, which was at median 3.4 years after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Status for the 21 survivors at the last follow-up was: mRS 2 or less (n = 6) and mRS 3-5 (n = 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The oldest patient with mRS 2 or less was 53 years at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (43%) could walk without substantial aid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The long-term survival after mMCA infarction treated with hemicraniectomy seems to be favourable if the patient survives the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The outcome as measured with mRS may be better among younger patients </plain></SENT>
