<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Cortical spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (CSD) and periinfarct depolarization (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi>) have been shown in various experimental models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to cause secondary neuronal damage and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For decades it has been questioned whether CSD or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> occur in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe CSD and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> in patients with malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> detected by subdural electrocorticography (ECoG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Centres of the Co-operative Study of Brain Injury Depolarisations (COSBID) recruited 16 patients with large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During surgery for decompressive hemicraniectomy, an electrode strip was placed on the periinfarct region, from which four ECoG channels were acquired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1,638 hours was recorded; mean monitoring time per patient was 109.2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 127 CSD and 42 PID events were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In CSD, a stereotyped slow potential change spreading between adjacent channels was accompanied by transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of ECoG activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi>, a slow potential change spread between neighboring channels despite already established suppression of ECoG activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most CSDs and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi> appeared repetitively in clusters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CSD or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In these two patients, the electrode strip had been placed over infarcted tissue, and accordingly, no local ECoG or recurrent transient depolarization activity occurred throughout the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: CSD and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> occurred spontaneously with high frequency in this study of patients with malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the large volume of experimental studies of occlusive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that implicate spreading depolarizations in its pathophysiology can be translated, with appropriate caution, to patients and their treatment </plain></SENT>
