<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To establish whether any early indicators of survival exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective descriptive study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Neuro-critical care unit of a university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Fifty-three patients (mean age 64 +/- 10 years) with 'malignant' <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Maximum conservative intensive care using a standardized protocol (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, osmotherapy, tromethamol, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The start of therapy was within 12 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale (GCS) and Scandinavian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (SSS) were recorded daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A computed tomography (CT) scan was performed on admission, on day 3 and on day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SSS, Barthel Index and Rankin Scale of the surviving patients were recorded after 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On admission, the mean GCS was 13 +/- 3 points and mean SSS 18 +/- 7 points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had to undergo mechanical ventilation (23 +/- 26 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms) and were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> after 28 +/- 30 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of 53 patients, 37 (70%) suffered brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the intensive care unit (ICU) after an average of 90 +/- 59 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After 3 months 42/53 (79 %) patients had died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The Barthel Index of the surviving patients was 54 +/- 12 points, the SSS 25 +/- 9 points and the Rankin Scale 3 +/- 1 points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The deceased patients had a significantly higher body temperature on admission than the surviving patients (36.8 degrees C vs 36.3 degrees C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The mortality of patients with 'malignant' <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction is very high despite maximum conservative intensive care </plain></SENT>
