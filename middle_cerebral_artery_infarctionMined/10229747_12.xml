<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: No neuroradiological markers have been characterized that support a timely decision for decompressive surgery in malignant middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) infarction (mMCAI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This case-control study was designed to analyze whether early cerebral CT (CCT) scanning provides reliable information for the prospective selection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients at risk of developing mMCAI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-one pairs (n=62) were formed with cases (mMCAI) and controls (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> but not malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction) closely matched in terms of age, sex, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CCT was performed within 18 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and analyzed by a blinded neuroradiologist according to a defined panel of 12 CCT criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In terms of predicting mMCAI, the criteria of extended <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory hypodensities &gt;67% and &gt;50%, hemispheric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e>, midline shift, and hyperdense <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> sign exhibited high specificity (100%, 93 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>5%, 100%, 96.7%, and 83.9%, respectively) but low sensitivity (45.2%, 58.1%, 12.9%, 19.4%, and 70.9%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two criteria yielded high sensitivity (subarachnoid space compressed, 100%; cella media compressed, 80.6%) but low specificity (29% and 74.2%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The criterion of attenuated corticomedullary contrast yielded both high specificity (96.8%) and sensitivity (87.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The latter remained as the crucial criterion [Exp(B)=90.8; 95% CI, 5.8 to 1427 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>5] in a 2-tailed logistic regression analysis with the strongest correlating parameters (Spearman correlation factor &gt;/=0.6 or &lt;/=-0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of CCT scans within 18 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> revealed an attenuated corticomedullary contrast as the crucial CCT criterion, which, with both sufficient sensitivity and specificity, predicted mMCAI with 95% certainty </plain></SENT>
