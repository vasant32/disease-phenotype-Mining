<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After a period of pessimism regarding decompressive hemicraniectomy in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the method has reemerged in the past decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to assess the immediate and long-term outcome of this intervention and to help better define the selection criteria for surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors conducted a nonrandomized prospective study using decompressive hemicraniectomy with duraplasty in patients at various stages of clinical deterioration due to a space-occupying middle cerebral artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were assessed at 6 and 12 months <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857175" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postinfarction</z:e> by using functional scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjective reconsideration was assessed using a questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 48.4 +/- 11.2 years, and the mean preoperative Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score was 9.9 +/- 3.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median time from ictus to surgery was 54 hours (range 13-288 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of survival at 1 year postsurgery was 73% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among survivors, 33.3% were independent (Barthel Index [BI] &gt; 95) and 55.6% were partially dependent (BI 60-95) at 1 year postsurgery, with 72% attaining the ability to walk independently by 1 year postsurgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No patient remained in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917808" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vegetative state</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 1-year BI score was inversely related to patient age (r = -0.47, p = 0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Survival after decompressive hemicraniectomy was better than previously reported using medical management alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917808" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vegetative state</z:e> was avoided and functional independence was possible, especially in younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Increasing age was a statistically significant predictor of disability and long-term functional dependence </plain></SENT>
