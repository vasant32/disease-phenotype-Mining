<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, mortality remains high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality and outcomes in a cohort of patients with large hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> receiving decompressive craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients diagnosed with complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> and receiving decompressive craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hospital characteristics were compared among different groups (survivors versus non-survivors, good outcome versus poor outcome) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 71 consecutive patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 2004 January to 2010 April, 71 patients were enrolled whose mean age was 65.11 Â± 13.13 years and 33 (46.5%) of these were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The in-hospital mortality was 28.2% overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the patients who survived and were discharged, 37 (77.1%) had poor outcome (mRS 4-6) and 11 (22.9%) had good outcome (mRS 0-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pre-operation brain computed tomography (CT) hypodensity volume (p = 0.001) was significantly associated with mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In binary logistic regression model, pre-operation brain CT hypodensity volume (OR = 1.015; 95% CI, 1.001 to 1.030) and age (OR = 1.112; 95% CI, 1.017 to 1.215) were both significantly associated with outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with large hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> receiving decompressive craniectomy, pre-operation brain CT hypodensity volume was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality whereas age was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pre-operation brain CT hypodensity volume and age were predictors of outcomes in those who survived the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
