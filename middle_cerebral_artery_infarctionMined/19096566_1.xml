<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Repeated administration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> in the setting of large hemispheric infarction is a controversial and poorly defined therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to examine the effects of multiple-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> on a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> after large hemispheric infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A middle cerebral artery was occluded with the rat suture model for 6 hours and reperfused in 22 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats were randomly assigned to either control (n=10) or the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>-treated group (n=12) in which intravenous <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> infusions (0.8 g/kg) were performed six times every four hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After staining a brain slice with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>, the weight of hemispheres, infarcted (IH) and contralateral (CH), and the IH/CH weight ratio were examined, and then hemispheric accumulation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> was photometrically evaluated based on formation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> catalyzed by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> dehydrogenase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">Mannitol</z:chebi> administration produced changes in body weight of -7.6+/-1.1%, increased plasma osmolality to 312+/-8 mOsm/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It remarkably <z:mp ids='MP_0001260'>increased weight</z:mp> of IH (0.77+/-0.06 gm versus 0.68+/-0.03 gm : p&lt;0.01) and the IH/CH weight ratio (1.23+/-0.07 versus 1.12+/-0.05 : p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The photometric absorption at 340 nm of the cerebral tissue in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>-treated group was increased to 0.375+/-0.071 and 0.239+/-0.051 in the IH and CH, respectively from 0.167+/-0.082 and 0.162+/-0.091 in the IH and CH of the control group (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Multiple-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> is likely to aggravate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> due to parenchymal accumulation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> in the infarcted brain tissue </plain></SENT>
