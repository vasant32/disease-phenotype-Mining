<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a pooled analysis of randomised trials, surgical decompression within 48 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> reduced case fatality and improved functional outcome; however, the effect of surgery after longer intervals is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of HAMLET was to assess the effect of decompressive surgery within 4 days of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms in patients with space-occupying hemispheric infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with space-occupying hemispheric infarction were randomly assigned within 4 days of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to surgical decompression or best medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was the modified Rankin scale (mRS) score at 1 year, which was dichotomised between good (0-3) and poor (4-6) outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other outcome measures were the dichotomy of mRS score between 4 and 5, case fatality, quality of life, and symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis was by intention to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This trial is registered, ISRCTN94237756 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Between November, 2002, and October, 2007, 64 patients were included; 32 were randomly assigned to surgical decompression and 32 to best medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surgical decompression had no effect on the primary outcome measure (absolute risk reduction [ARR] 0%, 95% CI -21 to 21) but did reduce case fatality (ARR 38%, 15 to 60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a meta-analysis of patients in DECIMAL (DEcompressive Craniectomy In MALignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e>), DESTINY (DEcompressive Surgery for the Treatment of malignant INfarction of the middle cerebral arterY), and HAMLET who were randomised within 48 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, surgical decompression reduced poor outcome (ARR 16%, -0.1 to 33) and case fatality (ARR 50%, 34 to 66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Surgical decompression reduces case fatality and poor outcome in patients with space-occupying infarctions who are treated within 48 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There is no evidence that this operation improves functional outcome when it is delayed for up to 96 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The decision to perform the operation should depend on the emphasis patients and relatives attribute to survival and dependency </plain></SENT>
