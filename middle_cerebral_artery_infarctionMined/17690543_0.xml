<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, assessed by the Alberta <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) method and unaided visual determination of the CT Summit Criterion, correlates with increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> following rt-PA administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Concerns about the accuracy of the unaided visual assessment in the estimation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and the conservative nature of the ASPECTS method led us to develop a new method (MCAGrid) based on stereological grid counting and a digital atlas of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We tested the hypotheses that the stereological method increases the accuracy of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> estimation and that the number of patients deemed eligible for thrombolysis is greater with this method than with existing methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four experienced radiologists with extensive neuroradiological experience examined the CT images of 19 patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and determined patient eligibility for thrombolysis by: unaided visual determination of the CT Summit Criterion, MCAGrid, and the ASPECTS score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The chi(2) test was used to compare the differences in the number of patients deemed 'eligible' for thrombolysis by the 3 imaging methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, the unaided visual assessment and MCAGrid were compared with volumes calculated following manual segmentation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, and the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative likelihood ratios for these techniques were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In general, MCAGrid was better than unaided visual assessment in the prediction of &gt;1/3 involvement of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of patients considered as 'eligible' for thrombolysis based on imaging criteria was significantly lower when ASPECTS criteria (15/76) were used than when unaided visual determination of the CT Summit Criterion (32/76; p &lt; 0.01) or MCAGrid (59/76; p &lt; 0.001) criteria were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The choice of methods for rating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> extent affects the number of patients 'eligible' for thrombolysis significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, MCAGrid increased the accuracy with which <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> extent was estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results provide justification for a prospective study of this technique in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
