<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed the efficacy and safety of this newly suggested surgical method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: eleven patients (group A) underwent this newly suggested decompressive surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The bony landmarks for decompressive craniectomy are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The area of the bone flap and the brain volume protruding out of the skull surface were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The outcomes were evaluated 3 months after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the results were compared with that of 13 patients (group B) who were treated with conventional surgical methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: the mean area of craniectomy was larger in group A (399.9 ± 50.9 cm) than that in group B (308.5 ± 50.5 cm, P=0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The brain volume protruding out of the skull surface was 161.8 ± 101.7 cm in group A and 106.3 ± 55.1 cm in group B, indicating that more decompression was performed in group A (P=0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six (54.5%) of 11 patients in group A had favorable outcomes (modified Rankin Scale 0 to 3) without mortality, whereas 2 (15.4%) of 13 patients in group B had favorable outcomes and 3 (23.1%) patients in group B expired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: decompressive craniectomy using the newly suggested method is feasible and safe, and it may be more beneficial, compared with conventional craniectomy, for patients with malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it may be easier to perform by training neurosurgeons </plain></SENT>
