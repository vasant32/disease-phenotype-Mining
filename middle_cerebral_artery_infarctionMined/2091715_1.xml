<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this effort was to develop QEEG rules that related to the patient's neurologic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three QEEG relative delta spectral patterns were identified in the right hemisphere which related to neurologic residua </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These include limited perisylvian involvement, mixed involvement of perisylvian and extrasylvian regions, and extrasylvian involvement only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While there were parallels between QEEG spectral patterns and auditory, visual and somatosensory evoked potentials, there were modality specific features consistent with functional differences </plain></SENT>
