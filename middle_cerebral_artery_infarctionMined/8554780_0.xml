<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a rat model for middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and discuss its usefulness for the study of structural consequences of various ischemic periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We inserted 4/0 polyethylene sutures into the external carotid artery of 48 Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The tips were rounded and coated with a thin layer of dental <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By inserting a section 18 mm long we assured that placement of the tip was between the origins of the middle and anterior cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The suture was withdrawn at predetermined times to allow complete reflux through the common carotid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The animals were sacrificed 24 hours after this procedure and tested for the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> by staining with 2,3,5 triphenyl-tetrazolium on 2 mm coronal cuts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We identified several differences regarding areas of infarction after the different occlusion periods, as shown by ANOVA and Newman-Keuls testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, occlusion for 15 minutes did not provoke infarction; occlusion of 30, 45 and 60 minutes produced selective infarction of the caudate nucleus and putamen; and finally, incomplete cortical infarction appeared after 90 minutes and was complete after 2 hours, at which time infarction was similar to that seen after 24 hours of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intravascular occlusion is a reliable method for inducing focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, enabling us to confirm the existence of an infarction time threshold that is longer for the cortex than for the caudate nucleus and putamen </plain></SENT>
