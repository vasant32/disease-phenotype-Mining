<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that initial biological aspirin non-responder status (ANRS) helps predict END </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 85 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> on 160mg aspirin daily were prospectively included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>END was defined as an increase in the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) â‰¥4 points in the first 72h after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Platelet responsiveness to aspirin was assessed using the <z:chebi fb="95" ids="53371">PFA</z:chebi>-100 system, and ANRS was defined as a collagen/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> closure time &lt;165ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: END was observed in 10 patients (11.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presumed reasons for END were progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (40%), recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (30%), malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> (20%) and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with END had a non-significant worse neurological status on the NIHSS at hospital admission (8.4 vs. 4.2; p=0.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Initial impaired consciousness (30% vs. 3%), visual disturbance (60% vs. 23%) and ANRS (60% vs. 20%) were observed more frequently in patients with END </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, impaired consciousness (OR: 17.3; 95% CI: 2.0-149.5; p=0.01) and ANRS (OR: 6.4; 95% CI: 1.4-29.6; p=0.017) were found to be independently associated with END </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ANRS is common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients and is predictive of END </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of these findings requires further evaluation in larger longitudinal studies </plain></SENT>
