<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hemicraniectomy may be useful when optimal medical management has failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between June 1997 and June 2000, 19 patients who fulfilled the clinical and imaging criteria for large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> underwent hemicraniectomy because of impending <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> despite best medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) assessed neurological status on admission and at one week after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 3 month follow up, The Barthel Index (BI) and Rankin Scale (RS) were used to assess the functional outcome among survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 15 males and 4 females with a mean age of 46.5 years (range 27-76 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (53%) had dominant hemisphere <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean interval between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and surgery was 60.3 hours (range 20-103 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean NIHSS score before surgery was 20.5 (range 17-26) and 10.5 (range 6-22) after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient (5.2%) died due to post-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At follow up, mean BI was 56.4 (range 25-90) and RS revealed severe handicap in 4 patients (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients under 50 years of age had a significantly better outcome with mean BI of 60.7 as compared to only 41.3 (p=&lt;0.048) in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Speech function, especially comprehension improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with dominant hemisphere infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings add to previous studies suggesting hemicraniectomy may be a useful procedure in patients with large middle cerebral artery territory infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The functional outcome is good in younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A randomised controlled trial is required to substantiate these findings </plain></SENT>
