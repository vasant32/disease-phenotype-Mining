<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Decompressive hemicraniectomy for malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> has long been controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, data from randomised-controlled trials have shown that the procedure is life-saving and improves outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, these randomised-controlled trials were difficult to conduct, because of ethical considerations due to high mortality in control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While the use of historical comparators may not be ideal for phase III efficacy trials, these data may be useful to inform the selection of trial populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We sought to replicate the findings of the DESTINY trial of decompressive surgery in malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> using the Virtual International <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Trials Archive, to determine whether historical comparators could be used as an alternative to control groups in situations where randomised-controlled trials are infeasible or regarded as unethical due to the high mortality under conservative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We extracted data on patients from Virtual International <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Trials Archive who displayed signs of malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> (baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale&gt; or =20, LOC1A score of &gt; or =1 on the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale at baseline, lesion volume &gt; or =145 cm(3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We used a chi(2)-test and logistic regression (adjusting for baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale) to compare the functional outcomes (modified Rankin scores and Barthel index) at the last available follow-up assessment between the DESTINY surgical and the Virtual International <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Trials Archive comparator groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We assessed 90-day survival rates using a Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards modelling (adjusting for the baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fewer patients in the Virtual International <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Trials Archive comparator group (n=6/32, 19% with a 90-day follow-up) achieved a good functional outcome by mRS at the final follow-up, when compared with the DESTINY surgical group (n=8/17, 47% with a 6-month follow-up; chi(2)-test, P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This difference persisted after adjusting for baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (logistic regression, P=0.04), but not when accounting for patient age (P=0.66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analysis of Barthel index at the final follow-up revealed no significant difference between the two groups (chi(2)-test, P=0.07), although a trend towards a better outcome in the DESTINY group was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast with the findings of the DESTINY trial, we found no significant difference in 90-day survival rates between the surgical (88%) and the Virtual International <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Trials Archive (72%) comparator groups (Cox proportional hazards model, P=0.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The beneficial effects of decompressive hemicraniectomy on survival were not confirmed using a historical comparator dataset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our observations might be due to the fact that patients with malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> are usually excluded from clinical trials of drug efficacy, and patients identified from Virtual International <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Trials Archive may not have been truly representative of patients with malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This mismatch could be rectified through recruitment of population-based studies and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registries to Virtual International <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Trials Archive to increase the number of patients eligible for entry into the comparator patient data pool </plain></SENT>
