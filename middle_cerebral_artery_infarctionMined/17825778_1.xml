<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The juvenile nasopharyngeal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_236'>angiofibroma</z:mpath> (JNA) is a benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> that affects mostly young males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preoperative embolisation is an accepted treatment to reduce perioperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, however, severe complications may accompany these invasive procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: One 14-year-old JNA patient with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> was transferred to us for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751846" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">left middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> occurred during the embolisation procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Right side <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> and left eye <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine months later, another course of embolisation and surgical treatment was performed, but the presence of one oronasal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> was noted after the JNA was successfully excised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A free radial forearm flap was selected to reconstruct the palate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Angiography and embolisation carry the risks of accidental infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Oronasal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> may occur when incising through the 'embolized palate' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Possible complications should be discussed with the families in advance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the case of complications, the medical team should cooperate and try to prevent morbidity </plain></SENT>
