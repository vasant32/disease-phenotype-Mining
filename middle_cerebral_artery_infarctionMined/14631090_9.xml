<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine predictors of this detrimental process, we investigated alterations of extracellular non-transmitter amino acid concentrations in peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-one patients with infarctions covering &gt;50% of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory in early cranial CT scans were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Probes for microdialysis, intracranial pressure, and tissue oxygen pressure were placed into the noninfarcted ipsilateral frontal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">Positron</z:chebi> emission tomography imaging was performed in 16 of these patients to measure cerebral blood flow in the tissue around the neuromonitoring probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen of the 31 patients developed a malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction, and 17 did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients in the malignant group had significantly lower extracellular concentrations of non-transmitter amino acids than those in the benign group in the first 12 hours of neuromonitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At this time, CBF values determined in regions of interest around the probes by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography and tissue oxygen pressure showed that the monitored tissues were not yet infarcted, and no differences in transmitter amino acids concentrations were found between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, extracellular concentrations of non-transmitter amino acids were negatively correlated with size of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We assume that reduction of non-transmitter amino acid concentrations reflects an expansion of the extracellular space by vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation in peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> tissue of patients with malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings facilitate early prediction of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation and may help to increase knowledge of the pathophysiology of the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone of large <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction </plain></SENT>
