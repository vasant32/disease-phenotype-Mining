<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively evaluated patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction for one month survival after decompressive hemicraniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was conducted at Alzahra University Hospital, Isfahan (Iran) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients with infarction in total <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> distribution area, resulting in midline shift of brain tissue for greater than 5mm, underwent decompressive hemicraniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mortality rate was estimated one month after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients were 8 (40%) males and 12 (60%) females with a mean age of 49.9 ± 3.8 (25 to 70) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Left and right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> were involved in 7 (35%) and 13 (65%) patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four (20%) patients died within one month after surgery (3 females and one male, mean age of 59.0 ± 4.5 vs. 47.6 ± 3.4 in survived patients, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean of baseline Glasscow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale (GCS) score estimated 8.60 ± 1.55 in survived patients and 6.75 ± 0.95 in patients who died (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The survival rate of malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction treated with decompressive hemicraniectomy was the same as previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction mortality increased with age and lower admission GCS score </plain></SENT>
