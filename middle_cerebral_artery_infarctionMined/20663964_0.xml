<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Investigations were performed to establish if repetitive arm cycling training enhances the antispastic effect of intramuscular botulinum toxin (BTX) injections in postischemic spastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Effects on cerebral activation were evaluated by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> spastic hemisyndrome patients (49 ± 10 years) after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> (5.5 ± 2.7 years) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BTX was injected into the affected arm twice, 6 months apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>Spasticity</z:hpo> was assessed using the Ashworth Scale and range of motion before and 3 months after BTX injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Images were analyzed using Brain Voyager QX 1.8, and fMRI signal changes were corrected for multiple comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During passive movements of affected and nonaffected hands, fMRI activity was increased bilaterally in the sensorimotor cortex (MISI), secondary somatosensory areas (SII), and supplementary motor area predominantly in the contralesional hemisphere, compared with the rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following repetitive arm cycling, fMRI activity increased further in MISI of the lesioned hemisphere and SII of the contralesional hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For patients with residual motor activity, treatment-related fMRI activity increases were associated with reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo>; in completely plegic patients, there was no fMRI activity change in SII but increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo> after training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Increased activity in SII of the contralesional hemisphere and in MISI of the lesioned hemisphere reflect a treatment-induced effect in the paretic arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is hypothesized that the increased BOLD activity results from increased afferent information related to the antispastic BTX effect reinforced by training </plain></SENT>
