<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Color-coded perfusion maps can be calculated from ultrasound harmonic gray-scale imaging data after ultrasound contrast agent bolus injection to analyze brain tissue perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>First reports indicate that this method can display cerebral perfusion deficits in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a prospective patient study to evaluate this approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty consecutive patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> who presented to our department within 12 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were investigated with ultrasound perfusion harmonic imaging (PHI) after Levovist bolus injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Color-coded perfusion maps were calculated from the ultrasound data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the original gray-scale images were analyzed in cine mode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Findings were compared with those of cranial CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 30 patients suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> of the middle cerebral artery territory (median National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score, 16 points) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three of the 30 patients (76.7%) had sufficient PHI insonation conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 19 of these 23 patients (82.6%), a marked deficit in contrast enhancement could be visualized by initial PHI with the color-coded parameter images and cine-mode images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 17 of the 23 (73.9%), the perfusion deficit was found on the parameter images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The area of hypoperfusion in the initial PHI investigation corresponded to the definite area of infarction in follow-up cranial CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 3 of 23 patients (13.0%), a perfusion deficit could be demonstrated in PHI, although the supplying artery was found patent by transcranial color-coded duplex sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: With PHI, it is possible to display cerebral perfusion deficits in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>PHI yields additional information on the perfusion state of the human brain compared with extracranial and transcranial color-coded duplex sonography </plain></SENT>
