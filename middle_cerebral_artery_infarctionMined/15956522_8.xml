<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study was designed to determine whether calcification of the cavernous carotid artery (CCA) is associated with cerebrovascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the same way that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001717'>coronary artery calcification</z:hpo> scores indicate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to correlate the grade of CCA calcification with infarctions in the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nonenhanced brain CT scans of 40 patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-distribution <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, 34 with non-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-distribution <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, and 94 age-matched control subjects were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Circumferential calcification and thickness of calcification were graded for the CCAs on head CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Scores were determined for the left and right CCAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mann-Whitney tests and Spearman correlation coefficients were used to detect differences between patients and control subjects and between patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and those with non-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CCA calcification scores did not significantly differ in the groups compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The manner in which calcification was scored (by using circumference, thickness, or both) did not affect the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No difference was noted between scores ipsilateral and those contralateral to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Circumferential degree or thickness of cavernous artery calcification was not correlated with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> or non-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CCA calcification scores did not differ between patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
