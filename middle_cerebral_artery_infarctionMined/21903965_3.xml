<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elevation of intracranial pressure depends on both the space occupying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and the intracranial volume reserve (cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, CSF volume was not investigated as a predictor of malignant infarction so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that assessment of CSF volume in addition to admission <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size improves early prediction of malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> patients with carotid-T or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> main stem occlusion and ischemic lesion (reduced cerebral blood volume [CBV]) on perfusion CT were considered for the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The end point malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction was defined by clinical signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Volumes of CSF and CBV lesion were determined on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Receiver-operator characteristics analysis was used to calculate predictive values for radiological and clinical measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 52 patients included, 26 (50%) developed malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age, a decreased level of consciousness on admission, CBV lesion volume, CSF volume, and the ratio of CBV lesion volume to CSF volume were significantly different between malignant and nonmalignant groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The best predictor of a malignant course was the ratio of CBV lesion volume to CSF volume with a cut-off value of 0.92 (96.2% sensitivity, 96.2% specificity, 96.2% positive predictive value, and 96.2% negative predictive value) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on admission native CT and perfusion CT measurements, the ratio of ischemic lesion volume to CSF volume predicts the development of malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction with higher accuracy than other known predictors, including ischemic lesion volume or clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
