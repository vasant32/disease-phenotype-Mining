<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001998'>neonatal hypoglycemia</z:hpo> may be associated with later neurodevelopmental impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain injury patterns identified on early MRI scans and their relationships to the nature of the hypoglycemic insult and neurodevelopmental outcomes are poorly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 35 term infants with early brain MRI scans after symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001998'>neonatal hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (median <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level: 1 mmol/L) without evidence of hypoxic-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Perinatal data were compared with equivalent data from 229 term, neurologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> infants (control subjects), to identify risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurodevelopmental outcomes were assessed at a minimum of 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>White matter abnormalities</z:hpo> occurred in 94% of infants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, being severe in 43%, with a predominantly posterior pattern in 29% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cortical abnormalities occurred in 51% of infants; 30% had white matter <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, 40% basal ganglia/thalamic lesions, and 11% an abnormal posterior limb of the internal capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three infants had middle cerebral artery territory infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three infants (65%) demonstrated impairments at 18 months, which were related to the severity of white matter injury and involvement of the posterior limb of the internal capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fourteen infants demonstrated growth restriction, 1 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>macrosomia</z:hpo>, and 2 had mothers with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pregnancy-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, a family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, emergency cesarean section, and the need for resuscitation were more common among case subjects than control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of injury associated with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001998'>neonatal hypoglycemia</z:hpo> were more varied than described previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>White matter injury was not confined to the posterior regions; <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e>, and basal ganglia/thalamic abnormalities were seen, and cortical involvement was common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Early MRI findings were more instructive than the severity or duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> for predicting neurodevelopmental outcomes </plain></SENT>
