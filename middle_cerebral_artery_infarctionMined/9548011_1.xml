<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> on the autonomic cardiovascular system during sleep, and to correlate autonomic activity with the clinical status of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the middle cerebral artery were studied by means of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-night polysomnographic recording within the 1st week of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and at the 3-week follow-up examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Power spectrum analysis of the heart rate variability was performed using an autoregressive algorithm in 180 consecutive electrocardiographic RR intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spectral power was calculated in 3 main frequency bands: high frequency (HF), 0.15-0.4 Hz; low frequency (LF), 0.04-0.15 Hz; very low frequency (VLF), &lt; 0.04 Hz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data were compared with those of 10 age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in VLF (p &lt; 0.0005) and a decrease in HF (p &lt; 0.0002) components were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sympathetic-parasympathetic balance (VLF + LF/HF) was higher in patients than controls (p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, these components changed significantly during sleep, revealing a physiological pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These power spectral data were still present at the 3-week follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 4 patients who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> showed higher sympathetic-parasympathetic balance than patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data suggest a sympathetic predominance in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> during sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the flexible and dynamic properties of the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system are preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may be related to the degree of sympathetic predominance </plain></SENT>
