<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this clinical trial was to assess the efficacy of early decompressive craniectomy in patients with malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted in France a multicenter, randomized trial involving patients between 18 and 55 years of age with malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction to compare functional outcomes with or without decompressive craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A sequential, single-blind, triangular design was used to compare the rate of development of moderate disability (modified Rankin scale score &lt; or =3) at 6 months' follow-up (primary outcome) between the 2 treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After randomization of 38 patients, the data safety monitoring committee recommended stopping the trial because of slow recruitment and organizing a pooled analysis of individual data from this trial and the 2 other ongoing European trials of decompressive craniectomy in malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 38 patients randomized, the proportion of patients with a modified Rankin scale score &lt; or =3 at the 6-month and 1-year follow-up was 25% and 50%, respectively, in the surgery group compared with 5.6% and 22.2%, respectively, in the no-surgery group (P=0.18 and P=0.10, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a 52.8% absolute reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after craniectomy compared with medical therapy only (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, early decompressive craniectomy increased by more than half the number of patients with moderate disability and very significantly reduced (by more than half) the mortality rate compared with that after medical therapy </plain></SENT>
