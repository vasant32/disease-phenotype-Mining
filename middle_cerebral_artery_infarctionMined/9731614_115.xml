<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Malignant, space-occupying supratentorial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is characterized by a mortality rate of up to 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several reports indicate a beneficial effect of hemicraniectomy in this situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, whether and when decompressive surgery is indicated in these patients is still a matter of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In an open, prospective trial we performed hemicraniectomy in 63 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initial clinical presentation was assessed by the Scandinavian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (SSS) and the Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale (GCS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> survivors were reexamined 3 months after surgical decompression, with the clinical evaluation graded according to the Rankin Scale (RS) and Barthel Index (BI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the influence of early decompressive surgery (&lt;24 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, based on clinical status at admission and initial CT findings) versus late surgery (&gt;24 hours after first reversible signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e>) on mortality, functional outcome, and the length of time of critical care therapy was needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 46 patients (73%) survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite complete hemispheric infarction, no survivor suffered from complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> or was permanently wheelchair bound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with speech-dominant hemispheric infarction (n=11), only mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean BI score was 65, and RS score revealed severe handicap in 13% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 31 patients with early decompressive surgery, mortality was 16% and BI score 68.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Early hemicraniectomy led to a significant reduction in the length of time critical care therapy was needed (7.4 versus 13.3 days, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In general, the outcome of patients treated with craniectomy in severe ischemic hemispheric infarction was surprisingly good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In addition, early decompressive surgery may further improve outcome in these patients </plain></SENT>
