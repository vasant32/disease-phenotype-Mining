<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to analyze the locomotion outcome of hemiplegic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and to explore the factors influencing it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 247 patients (mean age 65.6 +/- 10.5 years) admitted to our hospital for rehabilitation were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their cardinal neurologic sign was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> caused by infarction in the middle cerebral artery as a result of a first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When rehabilitation programs were completed, the final motor outcome was evaluated and compared between patients with right and left hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the following items were analyzed: size, location, and subtype of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751421" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">hemispatial neglect</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>; cerebral blood flow (CBF); and periventricular lucency on computed tomography scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) There was a negative relationship between the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and the locomotion outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference in locomotion outcome was not significant between the patients with infarction of the perforating arteries and those of the cortical arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in the locomotion outcome was found between the patients with an atherothrombotic or cardioembolic infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(2) In spite of the existence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751421" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">hemispatial neglect</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, the patients with a right-sided infarction were significantly inferior to patients with a left-sided one in locomotion outcome, except for those with a large infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(3) In patients with infarction in the territory of the perforating arteries, there was a negative relationship between the area of decreased CBF or periventricular lucency and the locomotion outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When the area of decreased CBF on the homolateral hemisphere involving the infarction extended to less than or equal to two cerebral lobes, the locomotion outcome was significantly worse in the patients with a right-sided infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overall, for the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e>, the locomotion outcome was poorer in patients with a right hemispheric infarction than a left-sided one, except in the case of a large infarction </plain></SENT>
