<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> is estimated to occur in 10% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo>, but few patients undergo decompressive hemicraniectomy, a proven therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined the proportion of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> without significant baseline disability with large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> who would have been potentially eligible for hemicraniectomy in an era before publication of recent hemicraniectomy trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic stroke</z:hpo> cases that occurred in 2005 among residents of the 5-county Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky area were ascertained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two study physicians reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinical and neuroimaging data for patients with baseline modified Rankin Scale score &lt; 2, age ≥ 18 years with National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score ≥ 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> was defined as &gt;50% of the middle cerebral artery territory or &gt;145 mL on diffusion-weighted MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other eligibility criteria for hemicraniectomy, based on the pooled analysis of recent clinical trials, were age 18 to 60 years and National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score &gt; 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 2227 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo>, 39 (1.8%) with baseline modified Rankin Scale score &lt; 2 had large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None underwent hemicraniectomy, and 16 (41.0%) died within 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients (0.3% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo>) were potentially eligible for hemicraniectomy; 1 died within 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on criteria from clinical trials, only 0.3% of cases were eligible for hemicraniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Given the survival and functional outcome benefit in treated patients, future studies should determine whether additional subgroups of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> may benefit from hemicraniectomy </plain></SENT>
