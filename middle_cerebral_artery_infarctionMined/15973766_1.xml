<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Malignant middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) infarction is characterized by mortality rate of up to 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the value of decompressive craniectomy in patients presenting malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction compared with those receiving medical treatment alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction treated in our hospital between January 1996 and March 2004 were included in this retrospective analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) was used to assess neurological status on admission and at one week after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed up for assessment of functional outcome by the Barthel index (BI) and modified Rankin Scale (RS) at 3 months after infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten out of 24 patients underwent decompressive craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean interval between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and surgery was 62.10 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mortality was 10.0% compared with 64.2% in patients who received medical treatment alone (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean NIHSS score before surgery was 26.0 and 15.4 after surgery (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At follow up, patients who underwent surgery had significantly better outcome with mean BI of 53.3, RS of 3.3 as compared to only 16.0 and 4.60 in medically treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Speech function also improved in patients with dominant hemispherical infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Decompressive craniectomy in patients with malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction improves both survival rates and functional outcomes compared with medical treatment alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A randomized controlled trial is required to substantiate those findings </plain></SENT>
