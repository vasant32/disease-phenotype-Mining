<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Decompressive surgery for malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> increases the number of surviving patients; this, however, leaves some patients severely disabled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study analyzed the patients' retrospective consent to hemicraniectomy in light of the experienced functional outcome 12 months after hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective study included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent decompressive hemicraniectomy for malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> in the Department of Neurology, University of Erlangen, Germany, from January 2006 until March 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on mortality and functional outcome (measured by the modified Rankin Scale; mRS) 6 and 12 months after treatment were correlated with retrospective consent to hemicraniectomy as well as with a quality of life instrument (EuroQol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were obtained by structured telephone interviews with the patients themselves or their closest relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the study period 28 patients received decompressive surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Retrospective consent to hemicraniectomy was 82.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients, or their closest relatives, would not agree to hemicraniectomy again, given their functional outcome after 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two out of two patients who experienced an mRS of 5 would not have consented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Low quality of life was most often declared in this subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Retrospective consent to hemicraniectomy for treatment of malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction depends on functional long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We need to identify those patients who would survive the malignant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction due to decompressive surgery but only reach a severely reduced functional status </plain></SENT>
