<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: An association between the allele 2 of the interleukin 1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> gene variable number tandem repeats polymorphism in intron 2 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was first reported in 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subsequent studies in Caucasian Northern European patients have not confirmed this, although trends towards an association were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lack of statistical significance could reflect inadequate power </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study the association was reassessed in a large independent set of well characterised Caucasian patients and a meta-analysis of reported patient series was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 320 patients with endoscopically and histologically confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (124 pancolitis, 196 left sided and distal disease) and 827 ethnically matched controls were genotyped at polymorphic sites in the interleukin 1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carriage rates were compared using chi(2) statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis of this and seven previous studies in North European Caucasian patients was performed using the Mantel-Haenszel chi(2) test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients had a significantly increased carriage rate of allele 2 compared with controls (52% v 45%; odds ratio 1.3 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.7); p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The allele 2 carriage rate was highest in extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (carriage rate 56%; odds ratio 1.5 (95% CI 1.1-2.3) p=0.02) and in individuals who had undergone colectomy (carriage rate 55%; odds ratio 1.5 (95% CI 0.95-2.4); p=0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight studies showed a significant association between carriage of allele 2 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (odds ratio 1.23 (95% CI 1.04-1.45); p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The association of the interleukin 1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> gene polymorphism with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> is confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The association is minor and confers only a small risk to an individual but will contribute a high attributable risk in a population due to the high allelic frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Accurate phenotypic characterisation defines more homogeneous subsets of patients, such as those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849867" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">extensive disease</z:e>, in whom the association is greater </plain></SENT>
