<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 248 IBD patients diagnosed and hospitalized in the Department of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infectious Diseases</z:e> in Bialystok between 1990 and 2003 were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed age, sex, education, characteristics of job, type of the environment, discontinuation of employment due to IBD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> extent, need of surgical treatment, and coexistence of other diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-three IBD patients (94%) were diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), and only 15 (6%) were diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with CD were significantly younger at the time of diagnosis and male predominance was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the patients at the time UC diagnosis was 44.9+/-1.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histogram of the age of patients showed the characteristic biphasic distribution with two peaks between 20 and 40 years and between 60 and 70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The predominant form of UC was left sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, which affected almost 80% of the studied population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most extensive form--<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0868908" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pancolitis</z:e> was present in 34 patients (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 6% of UC patients required surgery, whereas 36% of CD patients underwent surgery (P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679225" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coexisting disorders</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>cholelithiasis</z:hpo> was the most prevalent and demonstrated in 35 patients (14%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disorders</z:e> were diagnosed in 2%, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> in 1.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Since 1998, the number of admitted IBD patients has slightly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Occurrence of UC in Poland is much higher than that of CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The majority of UC cases are diagnosed in young people (20-40 years) with the predominance of male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The most common clinical form of UC is left sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
