<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The natural history of IBDU includes potential evolution to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Few epidemiologically robust studies of IBDU exist so we aimed to describe the incidence and the natural history of paediatric IBDU in a population-based cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Incidence of IBDU was collected over a 10-year period (01/03-12/12) from the two largest Scottish paediatric gastroenterology networks (serving 74.4% of Scottish population &lt;16 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographics, diagnostic investigation and follow-up data were obtained until study end (31.10.13; unless prior transition or emigration) to ascertain reclassification of IBD subtype, clinical progress and outcome at last follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates and trends were calculated using publicly available population data and statistics generated using Poisson regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 65 patients were IBDU (57% male) at diagnosis with a median age of 11.3yrs (range 2.6-15.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The age adjusted incidence of IBDU was 0.65/100,000/yr (95% CI 0.42-0.97) in the 5-year epoch 2003-2007 and 1.14/100,000/yr (95% CI 0.81-1.56) for 2008-2012, a non-significant increase (p = 0.068) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had colonoscopy (74% ileal intubation), 62 (95%) had an upper GI endoscopy; remaining 3 had small bowel imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>61 (94%) had radiological imaging, 44 (68%) had a <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> meal and follow through with 15 (23%) having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> enterography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis, 53 (82%) had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0868908" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pancolitis</z:e>, 4 (6%) had disease distal to the hepatic flexure, 5 (8%) had disease distal to the splenic flexure and 3 (4%) had <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>37 (57%) had mild disease (defined as mild infrequent relapses) while 7 (11%) had severe chronically active disease with 5 (8%) requiring Infliximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 3.1 yrs (range 0.4-6.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>16 (25%) had their diagnosis changed (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> after endoscopic re-evaluation) after a median of 1.6yrs (range 0.6-5.7), to CD in 11 and UC in 5; 10 (15%) remained IBDU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>3 (4%) required surgery and had colectomy and end ileostomy, 2 (66%) had diagnosis changed to UC prior to surgery whilst the other remained IBDU and reclassified to CD later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the first ever UK population-based epidemiological study of IBDU, the incidence of IBDU demonstrated a non-significant trend to rise during the 10 year study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>25% of patients had their diagnosis changed after endoscopic re-evaluation, more than previously reported by systematic review (Prenzel and Uhlig JCC 2009) after median follow up of 1.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Most cases had inactive/mild disease activity; a minority remained IBDU despite re-assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST: None Declared </plain></SENT>
