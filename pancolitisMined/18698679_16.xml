<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DNA samples from 388 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), 405 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), 27 indeterminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (IC) and 201 randomly selected controls, from Canterbury, New Zealand were screened for 3 common polymorphisms in the TNF-alpha receptor: -238 G--&gt;A, -308 G--&gt;A and -857C--&gt;T, using a Taqman assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis was performed on the data obtained on these polymorphisms combined with that from other published studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Individuals carrying the -308 G/A allele had a significantly (OR = 1.91, c2 = 17.36, P &lt; 0.0001) increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0868908" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pancolitis</z:e>, and a 1.57-fold increased risk (OR = 1.57, c2 = 4.34, P = 0.037) of requiring a bowel resection in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carrying the -857 C/T variant decreased the risk of ileocolonic CD (OR = 0.56, c2 = 4.32, P = 0.037), and the need for a bowel resection (OR = 0.59, c2 = 4.85, P = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk of UC was reduced in individuals who were smokers at diagnosis, (OR = 0.48, c2 = 4.86, P = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TNF-alpha is a key cytokine known to play a role in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp>, and the locus for the gene is found in the IBD3 region on chromosome 6p21, known to be associated with an increased risk for IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The -308 G/A SNP in the TNF-alpha promoter is functional, and may account in part for the increased UC risk associated with the IBD3 genomic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The -857 C/T SNP may decrease IBD risk in certain groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pharmaco- or nutrigenomic approaches may be desirable for individuals with such affected genotypes </plain></SENT>
