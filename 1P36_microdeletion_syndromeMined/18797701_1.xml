<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A hypothesis of a similarity between patients with 1p36 deletion and those with Prader-Willi syndrome and the existence of two different phenotypes for 1p36 microdeletion has been suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main objective of the present study was to determine the existence of 1p36 microdeletion in a sample of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002591'>hyperphagia</z:hpo> who tested negative by the methylation test for Prader-Willi syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (7 females, 9 males), 16-26 years old, were evaluated with high-resolution cytogenetic analysis at 550-850 band levels and with 11 polymorphic microsatellite markers located in the 1p36 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytogenetic and molecular results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results obtained by high-resolution cytogenetic methodology were confirmed by the molecular analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We did not detect a 1p36 microdeletion in 16 subjects with the Prader-Willi-like phenotype, which reinforces that no correlation seems to exist between Prader-Willi-like phenotype and the 1p36 microdeletion syndrome </plain></SENT>
