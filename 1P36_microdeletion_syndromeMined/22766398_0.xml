<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>High resolution oligonucleotide array Comparative Genome Hybridization technology (array-CGH) has greatly assisted the recognition of the 1p36 contiguous gene deletion syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 1p36 deletion syndrome is considered to be one of the most common subtelomeric microdeletion syndromes and has an incidence of ~1 in 5000 live births, while respectively the "pure" 1p36 microduplication has not been reported so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present seven new patients who were referred for genetic evaluation due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>Developmental Delay</z:hpo> (DD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>Mental Retardation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>), and distinct dysmorphic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had a wide phenotypic spectrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases previous standard karyotypes were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Array-CGH analysis revealed five patients with interstitial 1p36 microdeletion (four de novo and one maternal) and two patients with de novo reciprocal duplication of different sizes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These were the first reported "pure" 1p36 microduplication cases so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three of our patients carrying the 1p36 microdeletion syndrome were also found to have additional pathogenetic aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings (del 3q27.1; del 4q21.22-q22.1; del 16p13.3; dup 21q21.2-q21.3; del Xp22.12) might contribute to the patients' severe phenotype, acting as additional modifiers of their clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We review and compare the clinical and array-CGH findings of our patients to previously reported cases with the aim of clearly delineating more accurate genotype-phenotype correlations for the 1p36 syndrome that could allow for a more precise prognosis </plain></SENT>
