<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report on a 10-year-old boy presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002342'>moderate mental retardation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000260'>large anterior fontanelle</z:hpo> at birth, mild physical anomalies including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000272'>mid-face hypoplasia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000490'>deep-set eyes</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000343'>long philtrum</z:hpo>, and small mouth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He was found to carry a paracentric inversion inv(1)(p22p36.2) associated with a 10 cM deletion at the proximal breakpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By YAC FISH, the boundaries of the deletion were established at IB1028 (1p21) and WI-5166 (1p22) STSs contained in YACs 781E8 and 954F6, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This large region, covering about 10 cM, contains the COL11A1 and AMY2B genes, whose haploinsufficiency does not seem to contribute significantly to the clinical phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the patient's clinical manifestations, also including visual problems and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002342'>moderate mental retardation</z:hpo>, are those typically observed in the 1p36 deletion syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Refined mapping of the telomeric 1p36.2 inversion breakpoint was obtained by FISH of a PAC contig constructed to encompass this subinterval of the 1p36 microdeletion syndrome region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PACs 1024B10 and 884E7 were found to span the breakpoint, suggesting that the clinical signs of the 1p36 microdeletion syndrome might be due to disruption of a sequence lying at 1p36.2 </plain></SENT>
