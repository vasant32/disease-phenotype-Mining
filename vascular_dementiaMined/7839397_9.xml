<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The sites of platelet activation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> are still unclear because previous reports have not identified them and various factors accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> can activate platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore examined the sites of platelet activation in patients with various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The ratio of the plasma concentration of beta-thromboglobulin (BTG) in the internal jugular vein to that in the antecubital vein (BTG-B) was calculated as an indicator of platelet activation in the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma BTG concentration was determined in 75 control subjects and in 186 patients with various subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> including lacunar, atherothrombotic, and cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BTG ratio was evaluated with regard to subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, time of blood sampling, size of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, presence of vascular lesions, and the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean BTG ratio was increased even in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase of most subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with the exception of cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which exhibited a persistent elevation of BTG-B concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> showed a significant (P &lt; .01) and frequent elevation of BTG ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High BTG ratios occurred in cases with vascular lesions observed on cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the BTG ratio and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> was partially associated with a lower BTG ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Platelets were activated in the cerebral circulation of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> even in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase, which suggests the development of underlying vascular lesions and of thrombogenesis with or without infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Platelets were activated mainly within the heart in cases of cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An enhanced release reaction secondary to platelet activation was often seen in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e>, which indicates that its pathophysiology differs from that of other subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
