<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Control and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> populations were approximately age-matched and their numbers also approximated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prevalence rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rates of two or more coexisting diseases in the same patient were also compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two populations were studied: one was designated the autopsy series, and the other the hospital series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the autopsy series, the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001640'>cardiomegaly</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was 1.3 times higher in the control than in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> population, and for MI it was 1.7 times higher in the former than in the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was higher in the control group by only a factor of 1.1, for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> by only a factor of 1.2, and for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> the rates were almost identical in the two populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate differences were statistically significant only with respect to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001640'>cardiomegaly</z:hpo> and MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When the non-vascular and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> were compared, the rates in the latter were higher by only a factor of 1.3 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001640'>cardiomegaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; for MIs, the rates were about the same in the two <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data for two or more coexisting diseases were almost identical in control and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> autopsy populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the hospital series, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> rate was 1.6 times higher in the control than in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) group; for MI, the control group was higher by a factor of 1.5.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
