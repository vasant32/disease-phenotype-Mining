<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (VADAS-cog) includes additional tests reflecting mental speed and executive functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to compare the results of the two scales among subjects with various degrees of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the multicentre, multinational Leukoaraiosis and Disability in the Elderly (LADIS) study, 616 non-disabled subjects between the ages of 65 and 84 were examined using MRI, the ADAS-cog and VADAS-cog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The WMH rating from the MRI divided the patients into groups of mild (n = 280), moderate (n = 187) and severe (n = 149) degrees of change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Covariance analysis controlling for the effect of age and education revealed that the ADAS-cog differentiated only the mild and severe WMH groups, while the differences between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups were highly significant with the VADAS-cog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The VADAS-cog significantly differentiated between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the white matter groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In comparison, the ADAS-cog differentiated only severe changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the VADAS-cog may be a more sensitive endpoint in studies of patients with white matter load and vascular burden of the brain </plain></SENT>
