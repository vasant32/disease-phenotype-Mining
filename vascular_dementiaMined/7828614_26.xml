<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition PET showed hypometabolism in the occipital association cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The functional pattern was condensed to a ratio of regional values of association areas divided by regional values of structures that are typically less affected by AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> this ratio was significantly related to age for PET metabolic data (r = -0.66, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ratio was significantly lower in AD than in VD and controls for both rCMRGl and rCBF </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Metabolic differences between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> and AD patients were less obvious in old age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there were no significant correlations between the perfusion ratio and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or age </plain></SENT>
