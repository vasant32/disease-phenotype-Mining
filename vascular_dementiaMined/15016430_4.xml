<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> is one of these well recognized factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It can result from an excess of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="26519">free-radical</z:chebi> activity and impaired <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> defenses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Paraoxonase (PON1), a component of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoproteins</z:chebi>, has antioxidative potential and was previously associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The impact of two polymorphisms in PON1 (Gln192Arg associated with enzyme activity and T-107C associated with enzyme concentration) was examined in a case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two polymorphisms were independent risk factors for nonAD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, particularly in APOE-4 noncarriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An at-'risk haplotype' could be constructed including the Gln192 and the T-107 alleles, suggesting that subjects at risk have lower plasma paraoxonase levels and this enzyme is less active </plain></SENT>
