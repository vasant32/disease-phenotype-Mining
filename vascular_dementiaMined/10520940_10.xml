<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the glutamine synthetase (GS) level in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a useful biochemical marker in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD), and to assess the source of GS (brain vs. blood derived) in CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sandwich enzyme immunoassay and immunoblotting were applied to detect GS in CSF and in serum from neurologically healthy control subjects and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo>, including AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The origin of GS was estimated by the concentration gradients of CSF to serum and ventricular to lumbar CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, postmortem brain tissue from controls and patients with AD was analyzed using immunohistochemistry for expression of GS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Levels of GS were significantly increased in lumbar CSF from patients with AD (20+/-12 pg/mL; P = .01) and to a lesser extent in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007354'>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In CSF of controls, GS levels were 4+/-3 pg/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The GS concentration gradients were less than 1:10 for CSF to serum and 2:1 for ventricular to lumbar CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity of GS was most prominent in astrocytes from temporal neocortex of patients with AD, suggesting a relationship between astrocyte reactions and increased GS levels in CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Level of GS in lumbar CSF of patients with AD is increased significantly but nonspecifically, probably related to the strong <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> in brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Glutamine synthetase in lumbar CSF is mainly brain derived </plain></SENT>
