<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The clinical significance of the apoE epsilon4 allele in white matter changes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> has been a subject of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the association between the apoE epsilon4 allele and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) before and after control for (1) potential vascular risk factors and (2) the presence of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects were 131 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> who had either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, or a combination of these 2 types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, with or without WMHs, lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association of the epsilon4 allele with WMHs was examined before and after control for age, sex, duration of symptoms, education level, severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, presence of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and potential vascular risk factors, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> disorders, smoking habit, drinking habit, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: WMHs were observed in 73 (55.7%) of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither the number of apoE epsilon4 alleles nor their presence was significantly associated with WMHs before or after control for the potential confounding factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that age, the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and the presence of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were independently associated with WMHs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The apoE epsilon4 allele was not associated with WMHs in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The fact that WMHs were significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> may indicate an ischemic origin of WMHs </plain></SENT>
