<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our present study, we show CSF protein patterns from patients with the two most frequent subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</z:e> (sCJD) defined by the codon 129 genotype (MM, MV, and VV) and the protease-resistant form of prion protein (type 1 and type 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The densitometric analysis of 2D gels showed up-regulation of 27 and down-regulation of 3 proteins in the MM-sCJD as well as the up-regulation of 24 proteins in the VV-sCJD as compared to nondemented control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Almost 40% of sCJD specific regulated proteins in CSF are involved in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, regardless of the codon 129 polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increase in CSF levels of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-6-phosphate isomerase (G6PI), and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi>-bisphosphate aldolase A (ALDOA) were validated on a larger group of sCJD patients including three possible codon 129 polymorphism carriers and three control groups consisting of nondemented, neurological cases as well as patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the abundance of these glycolytic enzymes in the brain as well as their cellular localization were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates for the first time the implication of G6PI in prion-induced pathology as well as its cellular translocalization in sCJD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The identification of sCJD-regulated proteins in CSF of living symptomatic patients in our study can broaden our knowledge about pathological processes occurring in sCJD, as they are still not fully understood </plain></SENT>
