<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In many studies vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) is the second most frequent cause of organic acquired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e>; accounting for 10% to 50% of the cases, depending on the geographical area, patient population, and diagnostic criteria used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is growing evidence that VaD does not include only multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MID) but relates to complex interactions of different etiologies (risk factors, cerebrovascular disease), structural changes in the brain, host factors and cognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This resulted in reconceptualization of VaD to emphasize the differences from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the diagnostic criteria used (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10, NINDS-AIREN, or ADDTC) are based on the experience with AD and as such have their limitations and are not interchangeable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From a regulatory point of view, therefore, future research is needed to better define VaD in general and possible subtypes of VaD as targets for drug trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methodological issues in VaD trials, as opposed to AD, will be emphasized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The European Medicinal Products Evaluation Agency (EMEA) has adopted a guideline for trials of symptomatic treatments of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, particularly in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There is no explicit guideline for VaD trials; however, many of the recommendations for AD are already applicable to VaD for drugs aiming at alleviating symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, VaD may be potentially preventable, underscoring the importance of primary and secondary prevention as in other cerebrovascular disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Large long-term trials are necessary to study the importance of different risk factors and possible intervention strategies with special reference to VaD </plain></SENT>
