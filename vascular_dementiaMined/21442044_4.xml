<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Future clinical demands for identifying diseases at an early stage may render them essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this pilot study was to test the analytical performance of two multiplex assays of cerebral markers on a well-defined clinical material consisting of patients with various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured 10 analytes in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 60 patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo>, or mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, as well as 20 cognitively healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used the Randox biochip-based Evidence Investigatorâ„¢ system to measure the analytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found it possible to measure most analytes in both plasma and CSF, and there were some interesting differences between the diagnostic groups, although with large overlaps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CSF heart-type fatty acid-binding protein was increased in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Glial fibrillary acidic protein and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin in CSF and D-dimer in plasma were elevated in patients with cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A multivariate statistical analysis revealed that the pattern of analytes could help to differentiate the conditions, although more studies are required to verify this </plain></SENT>
