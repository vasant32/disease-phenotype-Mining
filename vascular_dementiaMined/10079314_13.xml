<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An initial, high-resolution SPET study was performed with 99mTc-HMPAO, and after 2 days the patients were re-evaluated with 99mTc-HMPAO following systemic administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reconstructed SPET slices were evaluated visually and semiquantitatively by a semi-automatic rCBF map method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When 99mTc-HMPAO alone was used, bilateral hypoperfusion was found in the temporal and/or parietal regions in 33% (6/18) of the VD patients and in 70% (23/33) of the AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The corresponding data obtained by quantitative evaluation were 41% (7/17) and 71% (15/21), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The vascular reserve capacity, as determined with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> test, was preserved visually in 22% (4/18) and quantitatively in 29% (5/17) of the VD patients, but in 73% (24/33) and 76% (16/21) of the AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The differences in the perfusion patterns between the VD and AD patients were statistically significant (P&lt;0.01, Fischer's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the VD patients with hypoperfusion (bilateral temporal and/or parietal), 4/6 (67%, visual evaluation) and 4/7 (57%, quantitative evaluation) had a decreased vascular reserve capacity as determined with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the AD group of patients the corresponding results were 3/23 (13%) and 4/15 (27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> test is promising in rCBF SPET to differentiate VD from AD </plain></SENT>
