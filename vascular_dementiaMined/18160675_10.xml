<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Education may modulate the degree to which the neuropathology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) is expressed as impaired cognitive performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 2,051 participants age 65+ years at 27 AD Centers who died and underwent autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> took the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) within 2 years before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Braak &amp; Braak stage, neuritic plaque density, and Consortium to Establish a Registry for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> and National Institute on Aging (NIA)/Reagan diagnostic classifications quantified AD neuropathologic severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses modeled MMSE in relation to education and neuropathologic severity, adjusting for age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, Lewy body pathology, and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Higher education was associated with higher MMSE scores when AD neuropathology was absent or mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>But with more advanced neuropathology, differences in MMSE scores among education levels were attenuated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For example, among patients without AD by NIA/Reagan criteria, fitted MMSE scores ranged from 19.6 for patients with less than high school education to 25.9 with education beyond high school </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>But among patients with neuropathologically advanced AD, the range of scores by education was only 7.1 to 8.6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of larger education-related differences in cognitive function when <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) neuropathology was more advanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Higher Mini-Mental State Examination scores among more educated persons with mild or no AD may reflect better test-taking skills or cognitive reserve, but these advantages may ultimately be overwhelmed by AD neuropathology </plain></SENT>
