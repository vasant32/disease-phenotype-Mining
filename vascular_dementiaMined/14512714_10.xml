<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The main objective was to investigate the acetylcholinesterase E (AChE) activity in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with three common <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also wanted to investigate the influence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (ApoE) epsilon4 allele possession and CSF-tau level on the CSF-AChE activity in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study included 17 consecutive patients with subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>), 39 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), 14 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (FTD) and 12 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CSF was obtained by lumbar puncture and CSF-AChE activity was measured by an enzyme antigen immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSF-AchE activity was significantly decreased compared to controls only in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> group (p = 0.010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CSF-tau level was increased in the AD group compared to the control (p &lt; 0.01) and FTD groups (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No influence of ApoE epsilon4 allele possession on CSF-AChE activity was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that abnormal CSF-AChE activity in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> reflects a disturbance in the cholinergic system </plain></SENT>
