<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Intention-to-treat analysis is used in the analysis of randomized controlled trials to preserve trial power in the presence of missing subject data as well as to control for both known and unknown confounding factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One form of intention-to-treat analysis is last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Concerns exist regarding whether it is appropriate to use LOCF in analyses involving progressive conditions or in situations where missing data are non-random (e.g., subjects drop out because of treatment side effects or differing disease severity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the use of intention-to-treat imputation of missing data techniques, and specifically LOCF, in randomized controlled trials of the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37733">cholinesterase inhibitors</z:chebi> and memantine to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a systematic electronic search of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1984 to 2008 for double-blinded, randomized controlled trials of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37733">cholinesterase inhibitors</z:chebi> or memantine that examined progressive symptoms in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We collected data on the use of intention-to-treat and non-intention-to-treat analyses and on contraindications to the use of LOCF analysis and we performed quality assessments of included trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 57 studies that met the inclusion criteria, 12 did not report intention-to-treat analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 34 studies that employed LOCF as the only form of intention-to-treat analysis, 24 reported conditions that could produce biased LOCF analyses favouring the drug under study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The latter finding was more common in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37733">cholinesterase inhibitor</z:chebi> trials than in memantine studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The published results of some randomized controlled trials of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> drugs may be inaccurate (i.e., drug effectiveness may be exaggerated) or invalid (i.e., there may be false-positive results) because of bias introduced through the inappropriate use of LOCF analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This bias favours <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37733">cholinesterase inhibitors</z:chebi>, potentially preventing funding of and patient access to less toxic treatment options such as memantine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Licensing agencies should consider whether to accept LOCF analyses in research on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> progressive conditions </plain></SENT>
