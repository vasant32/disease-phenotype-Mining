<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> uptake site was used as a presynaptic marker for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> terminals and 5-HT1A and 5HT2 receptors were used as postsynaptic markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The binding sites were quantified with radioligand binding techniques, where the radioligands used were [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="7936">paroxetine</z:chebi>, [3H]8-OH-DPAT and [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6123">ketanserin</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presynaptic uptake site was studied in frontal and temporal cortices and caudate nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors were studied only in frontal and temporal cortices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between control and VAD groups in any of the regions investigated with respect to the number of binding sites (Bmax) and binding affinity (Kd) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This indicates that both pre- and postsynaptic parts of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> system are intact in these brain areas in VAD </plain></SENT>
