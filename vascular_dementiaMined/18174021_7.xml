<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Galantamine, a reversible inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> esterase (AChE), is a novel drug treatment for mild to moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, it has been suggested that galantamine treatment is associated with more clinical benefit in patients with mild-to-moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> compared to other AChE inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the protective effects of galantamine would involve induction of the protective gene, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 (HO-1), in addition to enhancement of the cholinergic system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain microvascular endothelial cells (mvECs) were isolated from spontaneous hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Galantamine significantly reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of mvECs in association with HO-1 induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These protective effects were completely reversed by nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) inhibition or HO inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, galantamine failed to induce HO-1 in mvECs which lack inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS), supplementation of a nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) donor or iNOS gene transfection on iNOS-deficient mvECs resulted in HO-1 induction with galantamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the protective effects of galantamine require NF-kappaB activation and iNOS expression, in addition to HO-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Likewise, <z:chebi fb="168" ids="17245">carbon monoxide</z:chebi> (CO), one of the byproducts of HO, up-regulated HO-1 and protected mvECs from <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in a similar manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that galantamine mediates cytoprotective effects on mvECs through induction HO-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This pharmacological action of galantamine may, at least in part, account for the superior clinical efficacy of galantamine in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
