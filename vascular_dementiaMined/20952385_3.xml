<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aβ is generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the actions of β- and γ-secretases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to Aβ deposition in the brain parenchyma, deposition of Aβ in cerebral vessel walls, termed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo>, is observed in more than 80% of AD individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mechanism for how Aβ accumulates in blood vessels remains largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we show that brain endothelial cells expressed APP770, a differently spliced APP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> isoform from neuronal APP695, and produced Aβ40 and Aβ42 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found that the endothelial APP770 had sialylated core 1 type O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, Ο-glycosylated APP770 was preferentially processed by both α- and β-cleavage and secreted into the media, suggesting that O-glycosylation and APP processing involved related pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By immunostaining human brain sections with an anti-APP770 antibody, we found that APP770 was expressed in vascular endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because we were able to detect O-glycosylated sAPP770β in human cerebrospinal fluid, this unique soluble APP770β has the potential to serve as a marker for cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> such as AD and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
