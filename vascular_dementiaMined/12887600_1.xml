<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to explain the molecular mechanisms behind the alterations to the blood vessels in CADASIL subjects, we scrutinized the expression of glycan and glycan-binding sites in the wall of vessels taken from five such subjects (vs. five control subjects matched for age and sex) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specimens were taken from the brain, heart, kidney, liver and lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the main vessel lesions were observed in the tissues depending on the blood-brain barrier, alterations to systemic vessels were also observed despite the absence of any symptoms </plain></SENT>
