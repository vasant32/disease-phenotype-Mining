<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) were determined in Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients without medication (AD; n: 22), Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37733">cholinesterase inhibitor</z:chebi> (CEI) treatment (AD + CEI; n: 32) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients receiving CEI treatment (VaD + CEI; n: 27) and the age-matched control group (n: 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NGF levels were detected to be significantly higher in the control group than in AD group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BDNF and NT-3 levels in AD group were not significantly different from control group's levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NGF levels in AD + CEI group were significantly higher than in AD group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was also no significant difference in serum neurotrophic factor levels between AD + CEI and VaD + CEI group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation between BDNF and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (r: 0.422, P &lt; 0.01) in AD group and a negative correlation between BDNF and MMSE scores in the AD + CEI group (r: -0.357, P &lt; 0.005) were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results suggest that while serum NGF levels are associated with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, serum BDNF levels may be associated with the severity of Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, future studies are required to determine the importance of NFs </plain></SENT>
