<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association of polymorphisms in klotho with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We searched for sequence variants in promoter and exons of klotho gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the association study, selected variants were genotyped in control subjects and in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was further investigated with its subtypes classified based on Trial of Org 10172 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Treatment (TOAST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant association was observed for both G-395A and C1818T with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The analysis with subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> revealed the associations that the A allele of G-395A increased the risk of cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (CE, OR=2.60; P=0.006), and subjects carrying the A allele were susceptible to CE in both of dominant (AA+GA versus GG; OR=2.50; P=0.046) and recessive (AA versus GA+GG; OR=6.52; P=0.007) models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further analysis of data partitioned by gender showed that the associations of G-395A with CE only existed in women (A versus G; OR=4.33; P=0.002), AA+GA versus GG; OR=5.68; P=0.014, and AA versus GA+GG; OR=9.07; P=0.012), but the significance disappeared in men (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sequence variant of G-395A in klotho might be a genetic risk factor for CE in females </plain></SENT>
