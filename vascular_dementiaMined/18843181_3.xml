<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A sample of subjects older than 60 years was screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the first phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the second phase, the diagnostic workup included a structured interview, physical and neurological examination, laboratory exams, a brain scan, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV criteria diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age was 71.5 years (n = 1,563) and 58.3% had up to 4 years of schooling (68.7% female) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 107 subjects with an observed prevalence of 6.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The estimate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> prevalence was 12.9%, considering design effect, nonresponse during the community phase, and positive and negative predictive values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> was the most frequent cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (59.8%), followed by vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (15.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Older age and illiteracy were significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The estimate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> prevalence was higher than previously reported in Brazil, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> being the most frequent causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> prevalence in Brazil and in other Latin American countries should be addressed by additional studies to confirm these higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rates which might have a sizable impact on countries' health services </plain></SENT>
