<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in alpha 1M and UT levels and alpha 1M: UT ratios among three groups: age-matched control subjects, patients with either Alzheimer-type senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (ATD) or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although a positive correlation was established between alpha 1M and UT levels in these groups, the regression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients differed significantly from that of controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A tendency towards a negative correlation between alpha 1M: UT ratios and the levels of severity or duration of the disease was displayed in the ATD group, whereas a tendency toward a positive correlation between alpha 1M: UT ratios and the levels of severity was observed in the VD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that changes in the relationships between urinary levels of alpha 1M and UT may provide a useful biochemical index for diagnoses of ATD and VD </plain></SENT>
