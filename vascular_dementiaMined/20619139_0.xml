<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There are obvious changes in neuropeptides from plasma and cerebrospinal fluid in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), and regulating the levels of neuropeptides is a key for prevention and treatment of VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical efficacy of moxibustion at head-points in treatment of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), and assess its effects on memory-related neuropeptides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: A total of 65 VaD patients from Acupuncture Hospital, Anhui University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, were randomly divided into moxibustion group (33 cases) and Western medicine group (32 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients in the moxibustion group were treated with indirect moxibustion with common monkshood cake for 20 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients in the Western medicine group were orally administered piracetam tablets, 0.8 g for three times a day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One treatment course was 4 weeks, and they were treated for 4 treatment courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measures: The scores of Hasegawa's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Scale (HDS), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Activity of Daily Living Scale (ADL), as well as the levels of learning and memory-related neuropeptides from cerebrospinal fluid such as somatostatin (SS) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) were measured before and after treatment in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total response rate was significantly higher in the moxibustion group than in the Western medicine group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in scores of HDS, MMSE and ADL between before and after treatment in the two groups(P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After treatment, the scores of HDS, MMSE and ADL in the moxibustion group were more improved as compared with those in the Western medicine group (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The levels of SS and AVP after treatment were higher than those before treatment in the two groups(P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After treatment, the increased levels of SS and AVP were higher in the moxibustion group than in the Western medicine group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Moxibustion is effective in improving the clinical symptom scores and regulating the levels of neuropeptides associated with learning and memory in VaD patients </plain></SENT>
