<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ABSTRACTBackground: The neurobiological basis of increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients is unclear, though there are several related pathological changes, including white matter hyperintensities (WMH), and medial temporal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subcortical gray matter structures have also been implicated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> resulting from vascular pathology, particularly vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate the contribution of changes in subcortical gray matter structures to post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (PSD).Methods: T1- and T2-weighted images and T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images were obtained on a 3-Tesla magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) system, in four groups aged over 75 years: post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (PSD; 8), post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (PSnoD; 33), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD; 26) and controls (30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Automated software was used to measure the volume of thalamus, putamen, caudate nucleus, and hippocampus as well as total WMH volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of subcortical lacunes was also counted.Results: The number of caudate lacunes was higher in the PSnoD group, compared with AD (p = 0.029) and controls (p = 0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The putamen volume was smaller in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and AD groups, when compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the whole <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group, putamen lacunes were correlated with impairment in memory (Rey test; œÅ = -0.365; p = 0.031), while WMH and hippocampal volume both correlated with global dysfunction.Conclusion: Our findings implicate a variety of neurobiological substrates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, such as small vessel disease and Alzheimer pathology, which develop after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in an old older population, with a contribution from subcortical brain structures </plain></SENT>
