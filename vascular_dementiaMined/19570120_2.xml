<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the relationship between cerebrovascular findings reported on MRI brain scans and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260657" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">behavioural problems</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical notes were retrospectively reviewed in patients undergoing brain MRI following referral for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> to a memory clinic between January 2004 and June 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with AD were graded into four categories of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> severity based on neuroradiology reports and assessed for behavioural and NPS and activities of daily living using Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Geriatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale (GDS) and Bristol Activities of Daily Living (BADL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Frontal lobe symptoms and parkinsonian features were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the initial 232 patients who underwent MRI 72% were diagnosed with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>89% of AD patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> findings reported on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moderate-to-severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> was present in 47% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the AD patients satisfied a diagnosis of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant relationship observed between level of MRI <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> findings and scores on NPI (p = 0.57), GDS (p = 0.26) and BADL (p = 0.46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> severity did not appear to influence frontal lobe and parkinsonian assessments (p = 0.60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The contribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> to the pathogenesis of various NPS is still debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our study, based on patients diagnosed with AD in a memory clinic setting, suggests that there is no relationship between the extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> pathology and neuropsychiatric and behavioural measures in AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further prospective quantitative studies are needed to assess the role of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, if any, in neuropsychiatric and behavioural symptoms in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It is possible that the relatively small pathological contribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> to the development of these symptoms is obscured by the effect of the wider <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> encountered in AD </plain></SENT>
