<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Infratentorial abnormalities may cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo>, but current research criteria for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) do not consider them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purposes were to determine the prevalence of infratentorial abnormalities in VaD, their relation with supratentorial abnormalities, and whether they are relevant to cognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined 182 patients (120 men, mean age=73 years, SD=8) with probable VaD at inclusion into a multicenter clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI scans were evaluated for infratentorial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo>, midbrain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001272'>cerebellar atrophy</z:hpo>, basilar artery diameter and tortuosity, and supratentorial abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cognitive testing included the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and the vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> assessment scale (VaDAS-cog) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred forty-one (77.5%) patients had infratentorial abnormalities: 119 (65.4%) had focal infratentorial vascular lesions, 65 (35.7%) had diffuse pontine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> hyperintense on T2-weighted images, 20 (11.0%) had midbrain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, and 16 (8.8%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001272'>cerebellar atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations were found between number of infratentorial vascular lesions and basilar artery diameter (rs=0.26; P&lt;0.0001), infratentorial and basal ganglia (including thalamus) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> (rs=0.30; P&lt;0.0001), as well as between midbrain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and global supratentorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (rs=0.27; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Infratentorial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001272'>cerebellar atrophy</z:hpo> were not significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with midbrain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> performed worse on cognitive tests than those without midbrain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After correction for sex, age, education, supratentorial abnormalities, and center, midbrain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> remained significantly associated with lower MMSE scores (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Infratentorial abnormalities often occur in patients with VaD, but only midbrain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was found to be relevant to cognition </plain></SENT>
