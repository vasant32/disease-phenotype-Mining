<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL/METHODS: Sixty-four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (36 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 15 with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 13 with mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>), aged 45-92 years (mean: 69.9 years) with different degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (mean MMSE score: 17.0) were involved in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects underwent pCT at the level of the basal ganglia (50 scans, 1 scan/s, 40 ml contrast medium at 4 ml/s, delay: 7 s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CBF, CBV, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> values from 31 regions of interest (ROIs) in the gray and white matter of the frontal and temporal lobes, lentiform nuclei, and internal capsules were correlated with the MMSE scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Statistical analysis of CBF and MMSE revealed significant correlations in 22/31 ROIs including the gray and white matter of the frontal and temporal lobes, both internal capsules, right and left hemispheres, and total gray and white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of CBV and MMSE showed significant correlations in 21/31 ROIs in the gray and white matter of the frontal and temporal lobes, both internal capsules, left lentiform nucleus, right and left hemispheres, as well as total gray matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant correlations between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> and MMSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CBF and CBV calculated with pCT correlate with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and thus may play a role in monitoring disease progression or therapeutic response </plain></SENT>
