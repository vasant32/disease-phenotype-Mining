<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Professional organizations have recommended guidelines for the optimal investigation and management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unknown whether physicians from different subspecialties investigate and treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the same manner or according to these guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We screened 1,401 charts of patients who were seen in neurology, mental health, geropsychiatry and geriatrics clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The charts of 410 patients who were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were reviewed in detail to determine how they were evaluated and managed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 40% of patients received a complete laboratory workup to rule out comorbidities, 70% of patients received neuroimaging with either computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, 63% had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> screen and 38% of patients underwent neuropsychological testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the frequency with which they were obtained differed significantly across clinics (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency with which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38462">acetylcholinesterase inhibitors</z:chebi> (CHEIs) were used did not differ significantly (p = 0.07) for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), but differed significantly (p &lt; 0.05) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> categories where CHEIs are thought to be useful (AD, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There were significant differences between subspecialties in the evaluation and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It will be important to investigate whether these differences alter patient outcomes </plain></SENT>
