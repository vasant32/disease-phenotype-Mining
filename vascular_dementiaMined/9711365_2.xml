<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computerised tomography (SPECT) studies allow the assessment of cerebral blood flow and have been increasingly used as a clinical tool in neurology and neuropsychiatry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper examines the contribution of SPECT to the clinical management of patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, in particular patients with atypical or early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients admitted to an eight-bed neuropsychiatry unit in a general hospital setting who had undergone SPECT scanning over a 15-month period were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Information was collected on clinical diagnosis, neuropsychological testing, structural neuroimaging and SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SPECT abnormalities were present in 88% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pattern of SPECT abnormality was concordant with structural neuroimaging in 65% of patients and concordant with neuropsychological testing in 82% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of SPECT was 89%/79% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and 56%/79% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SPECT results must be interpreted in the context of other clinical and diagnostic assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In no single case was the clinical diagnosis made solely on the basis of a SPECT result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SPECT was of maximum clinical use in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementias</z:hpo> and in confirming the diagnosis of Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SPECT was valuable in Lewy body <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Its clinical utility in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>psychiatric disorders</z:hpo> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
