<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To estimate the incidence and prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study using prospectively and retrospectively collected data to evaluate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Four U.S. communities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: There were 3,602 CHS participants, including 2,865 white and 492 African-American participants free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, who completed a cranial magnetic resonance image between 1992 and 1994 and were followed for an average of 5.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was classified by neurologist/psychiatrist committee review using neuropsychological tests, neurological examinations, medical records, physician questionnaires, and proxy/informant interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Demographics and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (APOE) genotype were collected at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incidence by type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was determined using National Institute of Neurological and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009460" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Communicative Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> and Related Disorders Association criteria for AD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Diagnostic and Treatment Center's State of California criteria for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Classification resulted in 227 persons with prevalent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at entry into the study and 480 incident cases during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> scaled to age 80 were 34.7 per 1,000 person-years for white women, 35.3 for white men, 58.8 for African-American women, and 53.0 for African-American men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sex differences were not significant within race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adjusted for age and education, racial differences were only of borderline significance and may have been influenced by ascertainment methodology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Rates differed substantially by educational attainment but were only significant for whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Those with the APOE epsilon4 allele had an incidence rate at age 80 of 56.4, compared with 29.6 for those without this allele (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In whites, type-specific incidence at age 80 was 19.2 for AD versus 14.6 for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These rates were 34.7 and 27.2 for African Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>At termination of observation, women had only a slightly higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (16.0%) than men (14.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Sex and racial differences were not found, and VaD was higher than reported in other studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These data provide new estimates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> incidence in a community sample for projection of future burden </plain></SENT>
