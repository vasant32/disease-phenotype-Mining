<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although VaD is common in India, its pattern is not completely known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a hospital-based cohort, we aimed to characterize VaD by its subtypes and study patterns of risk factors and clinical, and neuropsychological profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vascular mechanisms, known to have racial and genetic variations were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NINDS-AIREN criteria were used to diagnose VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were subtyped into subcortical, cortical, cortical-subcortical, and strategic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vascular mechanisms were detected by vascular imaging, cardiac evaluation, and laboratory tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 42 consecutive patients with VaD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0007123'>subcortical dementia</z:hpo> was the most common type (52.4%), followed by cortical-subcortical (26.2%), strategic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in (14.3%), and cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (7.1%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Small artery disease was the underlying vascular mechanism in 42.9%; intracranial large artery disease, in 16.7%; extracranial disease, in 2.3%; cardioembolism, in 2.3%; multiple mechanisms, in 19%; and unknown, in 16.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subtypes were similar in risk factor profile and neuropsychological features but differed in clinical characteristics and vascular mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Gait disorder (59.1% vs. 0%) and urinary symptoms (77.3% vs. 16.7%) were more common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0007123'>subcortical dementia</z:hpo> than in strategic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The pattern of VaD demonstrated in our study is a reflection of mechanisms of cerebrovascular disease in India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Outcome depends on underlying mechanisms and thus is likely to differ from that in other ethnic populations </plain></SENT>
