<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (SVaD) is considered the most common type of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and often follows a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo> course, simulating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>progressive cognitive decline</z:hpo> is associated with pure SVaD or concomitant AD remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine what proportion of patients with SVaD lack abnormal amyloid imaging, and to examine differences in the clinical or MRI features between subjects with SVaD with cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath> and those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath> using (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET in 45 patients (men: women = 19:26; mean age 74.2 Â± 7.6 years) with SVaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> met <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV criteria for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and had severe white matter high signal intensities without territorial infarction or macrohemorrhage on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-one (68.9%) of 45 patients with SVaD were negative for cortical PiB binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was significant difference between (11)C-PiB-positive and (11)C-PiB-negative groups in terms of age (79.5 vs 71.9 years), Mini-Mental State Examination score (18.6 vs 22.6), the number of lacunes (3.9 vs 9.0), and the visual rating scale of hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (3.1 vs 2.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neuropsychological assessments revealed that patients with (11)C-PiB-negative SVaD performed better on the delayed recall of both the verbal and visual memory test than did those with (11)C-PiB-positive scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SVaD without abnormal amyloid imaging was more common than expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with SVaD with and without abnormal amyloid imaging differed in clinical and MRI features, although there was considerable overlap </plain></SENT>
