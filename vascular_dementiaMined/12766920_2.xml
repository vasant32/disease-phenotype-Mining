<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that control of these risk factors may prevent or alter the course of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of regular low-dose aspirin on outcomes for patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of hospital case-notes with further outcome information from telephone calls to general practitioners, social services and institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparison of outcomes for aspirin-treated and untreated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: One North London NHS Trust </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Seventy-eight patients with clinician's diagnosis of ischaemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, discharged from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> inpatient units between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 1997; 38 on aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival times from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to institutionalization and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median survival time to institutionalization was 28 months and to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 52 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no overall difference between aspirin and non-aspirin groups for these outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When data were stratified for social status, i.e. living alone or with carer when last at home, differences emerged for those living with carer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Aspirin was associated with a trend towards increased time to institutionalization (39 vs 22 months, p &lt; 0.09) and a significant advantage in time to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (71 vs 27 months, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These effects were non-significant after statistical adjustment for confounding variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results support but do not prove a role for regular, low-dose aspirin in improving both life expectancy and survival at home for patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Compliance may be better in those living with a carer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Larger, prospective studies should be performed to confirm these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Cognitive and behavioural outcomes should also be studied </plain></SENT>
