<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effect of Timosaponin B-II(TB-II), a purified extract from A. asphodeloidesb on rat vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) produced by transient (2h) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The learning and memory abilities of rats were measured by water maze task and passive avoidance task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Daily oral administration of TB-II at two different dose levels of 100 and 200 mg/kg resulted in a significant improvement of the deficit in the learning of the water maze task, beginning 14 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Shortened mean escape latency was detected in TB-II group compared with model group during the same trial days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TB-II treatment also significantly reversed the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced retention deficit determined by a one trial step-down type of passive avoidance task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, the expression of interleukin-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, and its receptor were significantly increased in TB-II treated VD rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results presented the first evidence of a neuroprotective effect of TB-II in the model of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> effect by TB-II is derived at least in part from its anti-inflammatory properties </plain></SENT>
