<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the human brain is known to transform DHEA into DHEA <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> (DHEAS), 7 alpha-hydroxy-DHEA, 7 beta-hydroxy-DHEA, and 16 alpha-hydroxy-DHEA, it is possible that DHEA accumulation in the brain results from a decreased production of such metabolites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we have measured and compared CSF levels of DHEA, DHEAS, 7 alpha-hydroxy-DHEA, 7 beta-hydroxy-DHEA, and 16 alpha-hydroxy-DHEA in 14 patients with AD, 12 controls, and eight patients with another common <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results indicated that DHEAS CSF levels were significantly decreased in AD and VD (P &lt; 0.007), whereas other metabolite levels were not significantly changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Use of steroid level ratios, such as DHEA/(7 alpha-hydroxy-DHEA + 7 beta-hydroxy-DHEA), 7 beta-hydroxy-DHEA/DHEA, and DHEAS/DHEA ratios, resulted in significant differences between diseased and control patients (P &lt; 0.0003, P &lt; 0.002, and P &lt; 0.002, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the 7 alpha-hydroxy-DHEA/7 beta-hydroxy-DHEA ratio was significantly different between AD and VD (P &lt; 0.0001) and could be used for differentiating AD from VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that, in AD and VD, increased DHEA levels are not neuroprotective and are neither better sulfated nor better hydroxylated at the 7 alpha, 7 beta, and 16 alpha positions than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results also suggest that, in AD and VD brains, the sulfotransferase and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochromes P450</z:chebi> responsible for the 7 alpha-, 7 beta-, and 16 alpha-hydroxylations of DHEA are either present at lower levels or transformed through natural polymorphism into less-efficient enzymes </plain></SENT>
