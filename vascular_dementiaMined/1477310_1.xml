<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the basis of computer-tomographical (CT) studies of 62 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, it was possible to distinguish three groups of patients, according to the type of parenchymatous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e>: (1) 14 patients with "pure" leukoaraiosis (LA); (2) 23 patients with ischemic foci (IF), and (3) 25 patients with a combination of LA and IF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A comparative study of these groups confirmed the concept that in the development of LA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> related to it, a special role is being attributed to such factors as arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and aging </plain></SENT>
