<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we observed newly generated neuronal precursors using doublecortin (DCX, a marker of neural proliferation and differentiation) in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus in SHRs compared to Sprague-Dawley rats (SDRs) at various age stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DCX immunoreactivity, immunoreactive cell numbers and its protein level in the dentate gyrus of the SHRs were higher than those in the SDRs at postnatal month 1 (PM 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At PM 8, DCX immunoreactivity, immunoreactive cell numbers and protein levels in both groups were markedly decreased compared to those at PM 1; however, they were higher than those in the SDRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were decreased in the both groups with age: DCX immunoreactive cells in the SDRs were few at PM 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that newly generated neuronal precursors are more abundant in SHRs than in SDRs during their life </plain></SENT>
