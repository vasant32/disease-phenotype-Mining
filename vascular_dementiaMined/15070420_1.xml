<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Epidemiological reports about <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) in elderly people from developing countries are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we sought to determine the prevalences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and AD in a population of nursing home residents and senior center attendees of Durango City, Mexico, and to determine whether any socio-demographic characteristics from the subjects associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or AD exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and fifty-five residents of two nursing homes and 125 attendees of a senior center were examined for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were tested by the mini-mental state examination, and those who scored twenty-four or less underwent psychiatric and neurological evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, AD and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) was based on the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Socio-demographic characteristics from each participant were also obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Residents of nursing homes found to suffer from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were 25 out of 155 (16.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighteen of them (11.6%) had AD, and seven (4.5%) had VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the attendees of the senior center suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> (pooled AD and VaD cases) correlated with white ethnicity (OR = 3.2; 95%CI = 1.28-8.31), and a history of unemployment (OR = 6.46; 95%CI = 1.42-25.97), while AD correlated with journeymen occupations (OR = 4.55; 95%CI = 1.00-19.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in residents of nursing homes found in this study is much lower than reported from more industrialized countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>AD was more frequent than VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ethnicity and occupation showed effects on the prevalence figures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> found has implications for the optimum kind of health care that nursing homes should provide to their residents </plain></SENT>
