<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We compared demographic, medical, and other epidemiologic factors among 113 African-American <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) patients and 79 African-American vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The typical background profile of our AD and VaD patients who entered into the study was that of women who were born and raised on farms in the southeastern United States, currently lived in an apartment or home in Chicago with other family members, and were retired, widowed, and had some form of medical insurance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The following distinct patient profiles emerged: (1) African-American AD patients were generally older than their VaD counterparts, more likely to have a family history of AD, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, a history of head injury with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> and hip fracture, and more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and difficulty with instrumental activities of daily living </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(2) African-American VaD patients had a higher frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> risk factors and focal neurologic findings, more difficulty with activities of daily living, and a higher frequency of medication use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differences in risk-factor profile may help explain differential susceptibility by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since ethnic minorities will constitute a higher proportion of the United States population in the future, targeted epidemiologic research to better understand etiology and risk factors for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> of middle and later life among minorities is needed </plain></SENT>
