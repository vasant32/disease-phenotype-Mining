<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with BD showed significant prolongation of the interpeak latency between N13 and N20 (N13-N20) and N20-P40 of SEPs as compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, whereas patients with AD only demonstrated significant prolongation of N20-P40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The interpeak latency between waves I and V of BAEPs in patients with both AD and BD was significantly longer than that of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in P100 latency of VEPs among these three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both groups with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> showed significant prolongation of N200 and P300 latencies of ERPs compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with AD showed significant prolongation of P200 latency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that these two dementing diseases have different electrophysiologic features that may be related to their underlying pathogenetic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the measurement of multimodal evoked potentials may be helpful in the differential diagnosis of AD and BD </plain></SENT>
