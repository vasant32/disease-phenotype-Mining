<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined data from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA), a population-based, prospective 5-year investigation of the epidemiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> among Canadians aged 65+ years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The risk of an adverse cerebrovascular event (including vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, or fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) during follow-up, was assessed according to serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> quartiles among subjects with no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at baseline (n = 369) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for certain covariates, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and nutritional indices, education, smoking and baseline cognitive status, the risk estimate for an adverse cerebrovascular event associated with the lowest <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> quartile compared with the highest quartile was OR 2.42 (95% CI 1.04-5.61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results from stratified analyses also showed that relatively low serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> was associated with a significantly higher risk of an adverse cerebrovascular event among female (OR 4.02, 95% CI 1.37-11.81) but not male (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.25-4.13) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the total sample, there was a consistent trend toward poorer health and cognitive outcomes during follow-up (including mortality, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) among those in the lowest <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> quartile compared with the highest quartile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Low serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> levels are independently associated with a significantly higher risk of an adverse cerebrovascular event, including vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, among older, cognitively vulnerable persons </plain></SENT>
