<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and blood pressure levels has been indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is, however, conflicting evidence over the definitive link between the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensives</z:chebi> and the subsequent reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The specific use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor blockers (ARBs) in preventing vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> has been investigated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4814">eprosartan</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In animal studies utilising <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone rats, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4814">eprosartan</z:chebi> has been shown to reduce end-organ damage of the heart and kidneys in a study assessing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Morbidity and mortality after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4814">Eprosartan</z:chebi> compared with nitrendipine for Secondary prevention (MOSES) study, assessing 1405 patients, has shown the cerebroprotective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4814">eprosartan</z:chebi> compared with the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi> nitrendipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this study, however, no change in cognitive function, as assessed by the mini-mental status examination (MMSE) score, was seen between the treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Observational Study on Cognitive function And systolic blood pressure Reduction (OSCAR) trial, including more than 60,000 hypertensive patients, also assessed the ability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4814">eprosartan</z:chebi> to alter the MMSE score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the MOSES trial, preliminary data from 10,000 patients after 6 months of treatment identified a decrease in blood pressure alongside a significant increase in MMSE score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Specific subpopulations within this study, including the elderly, patients with higher initial systolic blood pressure and patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 25-30 kg/m2 showed the greatest change in MMSE score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data indicate an association with blood pressure reduction and improvement of cognitive function with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4814">eprosartan</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
