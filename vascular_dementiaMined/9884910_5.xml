<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examines the extent to which independent diagnosticians agreed among themselves in diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, severity and type when presented with data obtained during a population-based incidence study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Secondly, it examines how judgements, based initially on respondents' self-reports and cognitive performance, were affected first by informants' reports and then by short case-vignettes written by trained lay interviewers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirdly, it compares diagnosticians' diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with the algorithmic diagnosis (AGECAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The items presented were selected from two screening interviews at wave 1 and wave 2 separated by an interval of 2 years and from wave 2 assessment and informant interviews, and included medical, psychiatric and ADL items and interviewers' own observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sample (N = 42) was derived from the first year of the wave 2 assessments, potential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases entering consecutively while presumed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> were selected randomly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Informants were available in 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Agreement on diagnosis and type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> improved with increasing information, particularly from informants, but remained poor regarding severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, defined operationally, increased from 10 to 12 and uncertain cases fell from eight to six, but no respondent initially diagnosed as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> case was rediagnosed as a non-case, or vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> type changed from agreement about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> to agreement about vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Operational and algorithmic diagnoses showed good agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Causes of disagreement, the role of vignettes and the relevance of the results for population surveys are discussed </plain></SENT>
