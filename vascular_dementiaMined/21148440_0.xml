<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interest in the use of surrogate markers is increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to determine if brain volume was different between patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> and control subjects, whether it correlated with cognition in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>, and whether changes in brain volume could be detected during prospective follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: thirty-five patients (mean age, 68.8 years) who had a lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and radiological evidence of confluent leukoaraiosis and 70 age- and gender-matched control subjects were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whole-brain T1-weighted imaging and neuropsychological testing were performed after 1 year on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and after 2 years for the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fully automated software was used to determine brain volume and percentage brain volume change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An executive function score was derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: there was a significant difference in brain volume between the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> and control subjects (mean ± SD [mL] 1529 ± 84 versus 1573 ± 69, P=0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>, there was a significant association between brain volume and executive function (r=0.501, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean ± SD yearly brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> rate for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> and control subjects was significantly different (-0.914% ± 0.8% versus -0.498% ± 0.4%, respectively, P=0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No change in executive function score was detected over this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: brain volume is reduced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> and a decline is detectable prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The correlation with executive function at a cross-sectional level and the change in brain volume with time are both promising for the use of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> as a surrogate marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> progression </plain></SENT>
