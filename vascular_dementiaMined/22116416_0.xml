<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We started recruiting patients into a prospective double-blind randomized controlled study aiming to provide class I evidence supporting or refuting the role of surgical management in INPH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criterion was the diagnosis of probable INPH plus objective improvement of walking speed following 72 h of extended lumbar drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with concomitant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients included in the trial were to have a shunt placed with proGAV(Â®) adjustable valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly assigned into two groups: group A was to have the shunt immediately adjusted to function, and group B was to have the shunt valve adjusted to the highest setting for 3 months then adjusted to function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Assessment of gait, cognitive function, and urinary symptoms were done before shunt insertion and at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Primary end point was to be an improvement in gait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points were improvement in mental function or urinary function and incidence of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Final results are expected mid 2011 </plain></SENT>
