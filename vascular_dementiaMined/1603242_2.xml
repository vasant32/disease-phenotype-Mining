<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prevalence, incidence and risk factors for specific age-associated diseases, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> will be investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A sample of 5,056 subjects 64 + resident in the field areas will be selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence rates will be estimated by using two subsequent prevalence surveys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the first prevalence survey, each sampled subject will undergo the Mini-Mental-State examination as screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those who have been screened positive, will undergo an extensive diagnostic workup to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases and to classify them as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>, according to the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IIIR, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10R and NINCDS-ADRDA criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects identified as non-cases will be re-assessed 3 years later by using the same procedure, instruments and criteria to estimate incident cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, genetic and environmental risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> will be assessed by means of case-control studies, one on prevalent and one on incident cases, and of the cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The project started in January 1991 </plain></SENT>
