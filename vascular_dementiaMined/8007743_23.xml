<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent investigations indicate that a neuroimmune reaction, associated with inflammatory mechanisms, can contribute in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) to cell damage and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activation of microglial cells, expression of immunohistochemical markers of brain immune function, the presence of complement proteins in brain tissue and changes in cytokine production have been reported in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have studied the concentration of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) in different regions of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) in post-mortem samples from patients with AD or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) and in age-matched control subjects (CS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IL-1 beta levels were significantly higher in AD than in VD or CS in the frontal cortex, parietal cortex, temporal cortex, hypothalamus, thalamus and hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The highest increases in IL-1 beta levels were observed in the frontal cortex (CS = 0.75 +/- 0.045; AD = 2.47 +/- 0.12, p &lt; 0.001; VD = 1.52 +/- 0.078 pg/mg, p &lt; 0.001) and hippocampus (CS = 0.71 +/- 0.042; AD = 2.63 +/- 0.19, p &lt; 0.001; VD = 1.21 +/- 0.23 pg/mg, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant changes were detected in the occipital cortex and cerebellum in either AD or VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results clearly demonstrate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients show a generalized increment of IL-1 beta production in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>, with maximum response in those brain regions where AD neuropathology is most prominent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This overall increase in cytokine production might represent an early event in the activation of a neuroimmune cascade leading to cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> in brain regions where a primary cause (e.g., genetic, toxic, vascular) facilitates the induction of resting microglia for firing brain immune function </plain></SENT>
