<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine if calcification can be viewed as a protective step of calcium homeostasis during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neuronal suffering, cerebral cortex and hippocampus of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the human specificity, these two areas were also studied in dogs with established <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, calcium precipitates were observed in the cerebral parenchyma associated with neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cerebral cortex presented a higher degree of calcification than the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group was characterised by a higher degree of calcification, whereas the groups with lowest calcification were the Alzheimer's patients and dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As shown by X-ray microanalysis, in the precipitates, calcium is mainly associated with <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi> in a form that resembles <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52254">hydroxyapatites</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, intracellular calcium concentration associated with neuronal suffering may reduce the energy extrusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose that, to help overcome excitotoxicity, calcium precipitation acts in <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> of vertebrates as a new compartment of the calcium homeostasis in which free cytoplasmic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39124">calcium ions</z:chebi> are inactivated by phosphate ones </plain></SENT>
