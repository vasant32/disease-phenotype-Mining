<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A prevalence study within a longitudinal cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: The original Adult Health Study (AHS) cohort consisted of atomic-bomb survivors and their controls selected from residents in Hiroshima and Nagasaki using the 1950 national census supplementary schedules and the Atomic Bomb Survivors Survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since 1958, the AHS subjects have been followed through biennial medical examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Subjects were 637 men and 1585 women aged 60 years or older in the AHS cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight subjects resided in hospitals and institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: In addition to the biennial medical examinations ongoing since 1958, a screening test for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (CASI) was conducted by trained nurses between September 1992 and September 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and its subtypes was assessed in 343 subjects suspected to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and in 272 subjects with high CASI scores who were selected randomly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> based on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> III/R criteria, using neurological examination, the IQCODE, and CDR &gt; or = 1, was 7.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> was 2.0% in men and 3.8% in women, and the prevalence of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 2.0% in men and 1.8% in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The relationship of risk factors to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was investigated by the multivariate logistic linear regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> for age (in 10-year increments), attained education (in 3-year increments), history of head trauma, and history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> are 6.3, 0.6, 7.4, and 0.3, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> for age, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> are 2.0, 35.7, and 4.0, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Neither type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> showed any significant effect of sex or radiation exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study is the first study of Japanese <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rates carried out with a protocol similar enough to that of a US study to allow meaningful comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The prevalence rates demonstrated are more similar to US rates than were found in many previous reports in Japan </plain></SENT>
