<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aims to investigate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> treatment strategies among physicians specialised in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) by analysing prescribing patterns and comparing them to current treatment guidelines in Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two primary care physicians in Germany participated in this prospective, multicentre observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prescriptions and diagnoses were reported for each consecutive patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were included if patients had at least one diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> according to the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with a prescription of any anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> drug including Ginkgo biloba </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the 5-year study period (2004-2008), 577 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were included (median age: 81 years (IQR: 74-87); 69% female) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was classified as unspecified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (57.2%), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (25.1%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (10.4%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> (7.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> drugs was 25.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The phytopharmaceutical Ginkgo biloba was the most frequently prescribed anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> drug overall (67.6% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37733">cholinesterase inhibitors</z:chebi> (17.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for receiving any anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> drug was greater than 1 for neurologists (AOR = 2.34; CI: 1.59-3.47), the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AOR = 3.28; CI: 1.96-5.50), <z:chebi fb="25" ids="35476">neuroleptic</z:chebi> therapy (AOR = 1.87; CI: 1.22-2.88), co-morbidities <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (AOR = 2.03; CI: 1.41-2.90), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (AOR = 4.85; CI: 3.42-6.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The chance for a prescription of any anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> drug decreased with the diagnosis of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AOR = 0.64; CI: 0.43-0.95) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (AOR = 0.55; CI: 0.36-0.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The prescription of Ginkgo biloba was associated with sex (female: AOR = 0.41; CI: 0.19-0.89), patient age (AOR = 1.06; CI: 1.02-1.10), treatment by a neurologist (AOR = 0.09; CI: 0.03-0.23), and the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AOR = 0.07; CI: 0.04-0.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of everyday practice for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in primary care in physicians with a focus on CAM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The prescribing frequency for anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> drugs is equivalent to those found in other German studies, while the administration of Ginkgo biloba is significantly higher </plain></SENT>
