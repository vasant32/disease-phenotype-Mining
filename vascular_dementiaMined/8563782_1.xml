<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It may be closely related to the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer type (DAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To examine the relationship between HSP70 and DAT, HSP70 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels in mononuclear blood cells (MBCs) from patients with DAT were measured by Northern blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found no significant correlation between HSP70 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels and aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that HSP70 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in MBCs from patients with DAT were significantly lower than those from patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and nondemented controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the lower levels of constitutive HSP70 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in DAT play an important role in developing DAT and that the measurement of HSP70 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> may be useful for the diagnosis of DAT </plain></SENT>
