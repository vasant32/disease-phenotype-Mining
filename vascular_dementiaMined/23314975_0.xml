<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009460" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">communication disorder</z:e> due to language deterioration is one of the main problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Behavioral neurology aims to clarify the relationship between brain function and behavior; language deterioration is one of the main targets, and its clinical applications are really useful for making better understanding of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Language is sequences of sound or characters that carry meanings for communication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From the evolutionary perspective, "language" can be thought about by considering birds and dogs: the basal ganglia and anterior cingulate, and the thalamus and cerebral cortex are thought to provide the neurobiological background, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Humans can use language </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The language area is a newly developed brain area in evolution and is mainly localized in the left cerebral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Semantic memory has also developed in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There are two routes, the superficial and deep routes, with the latter associated with meaning, and three brain areas are involved: the peri-Sylvian area, per-peri-Sylvian area, and right hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using these principles, language symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with progressive non-fluent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> (PA), semantic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (SD), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) can be understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Namely, the symptoms of PA is understood by the dysfunction of peri-Sylvian language area, those of SD and AD by that of peri-peri-Sylvian language area, and those of some VaD cases and AD cases by that of right hemisphere </plain></SENT>
