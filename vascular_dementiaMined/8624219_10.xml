<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) would perform worse on a test of semantic memory but not on tests of other cognitive domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We did not expect that women without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> would perform more poorly than men without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> on the same task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the specificity of a semantic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficit</z:e> among women with AD by exploring gender differences among a group of subjects with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A case-control study in which differences between men and women were explored using regression models to control for the potentially confounding effects of age, education, duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Research Center Consortium of Los Angeles and Orange Counties, California </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Volunteers, recruited from the community or clinic referrals, who met clinical criteria for AD (n = 159) or VD (n = 117) or met criteria for control status without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n = 134) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Five neuropsychological measures, commonly used in the diagnosis and assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Women with VD scored lower than men with VD on 3 tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, when controlling for potential confounds, the gender difference was maintained only for the semantic memory task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Women with AD showed a strong trend to perform worse than men with AD on the test of semantic memory only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No gender differences were found among subjects without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the existence of a semantic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficit</z:e> for women with AD and suggest that a similar deficit may exist among women with VD </plain></SENT>
