<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Design: a cross-sectional population study, including a first phase of screening and a second one of diagnosis confirmation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Study subjects: a total of 877 elderly people of 80-years-old or older belonging to the basic health care area of Manlleu (Osona, Catalonia midlands) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the first phase, relatives and/or caregivers were interviewed, and the participating subjects underwent a set of tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those who obtained 24 points or less on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and/or an equal Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) or over 3 were admitted to the second phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the second phase, a general and a neurological examination were performed, along with blood tests, cranial computed tomography scan and a neuropsychological study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV criteria were used for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnosis, NINCDS-ADRA criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and NINCS-AIREN for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Half of the people over 80-years-old had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One-fourth had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 70.3% of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> corresponded to AD (47.2% AD without vascular lesions and 23.1% AD with vascular lesions) and 12% corresponded to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The percentage of other degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> was 17.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Age and gender were observed to be associated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the COGMANLLEU study is similar to other European studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>AE is the most frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
