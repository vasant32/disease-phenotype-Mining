<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the cellular activation of the peripheral immune system in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), we determined the presence of IL-18 and TGF-beta1 in the plasma by using ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The levels of IL-18 and TGF-beta1 were significantly elevated in patients with AD and VaD compared to non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e>, age-matched subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found an inverse correlation between the levels of IL-18 and TGF-beta1 in AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In VaD patients, the correlation between IL-18 and TGF-beta1 reached a borderline positive value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas, in the non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e>, age-matched subjects, a positive correlation between IL-18 and TGF-beta1 levels was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that IL-18 and TGF-beta1 elevation is associated with AD and VaD patients, confirming that the immune system might exert a remarkable role in the development and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, as different modifications were detected in the patients affected by AD and VaD, we propose that IL-18 and TGF-beta1 plasma levels might represent possible differential biomarkers </plain></SENT>
