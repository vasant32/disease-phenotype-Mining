<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Older individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are highly sensitive to the effects of muscarinic receptor blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: This was a 6-week multisite, randomized clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects: Eighty-six patients with probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, or mixed-etiology <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV criteria) were randomly assigned to treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7735">olanzapine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Assessments: Anticholinergic activity was measured with a radioreceptor assay, and plasma levels of antipsychotic medications were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary outcomes were assessed with the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser (UKU) scale and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001262'>somnolence</z:hpo> adverse events; secondary outcome measures included scores on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and other scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no between-treatment differences in the UKU scale or in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001262'>somnolence</z:hpo> adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant improvements (p &lt; .001) from baseline were found for the NPI measures, with no between-treatment group differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7735">Olanzapine</z:chebi> was associated with significant increases from baseline in anticholinergic activity, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> was not; the between-treatment group differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increase in anticholinergic activity was associated with an increase in anticholinergic side effects and slower performance on the Trail Making Test Part A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Higher endpoint anticholinergic activity was associated with higher endpoint scores on several items from the NPI, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000746'>delusions</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, and aberrant motor behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS: Efficacious doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7735">olanzapine</z:chebi> increased anticholinergic activity in older patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, while similarly efficacious doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients whose anticholinergic activity increased were more likely to experience anticholinergic side effects and to have worsening in certain cognitive domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that certain patients may be vulnerable to the anticholinergic activity associated with antipsychotic treatment </plain></SENT>
