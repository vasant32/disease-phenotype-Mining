<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We describe the design and methods of the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS), a new national study that will provide data on the antecedents, prevalence, outcomes, and costs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and "<z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e>" (CIND) using a unique study design based on the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also illustrate potential uses of the ADAMS data and provide information to interested researchers on obtaining ADAMS and HRS data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The ADAMS is the first population-based study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the United States to include subjects from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions of the country, while at the same time using a single standardized diagnostic protocol in a community-based sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A sample of 856 individuals age 70 or older who were participants in the ongoing HRS received an extensive in-home clinical and neuropsychological assessment to determine a diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, CIND, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within the CIND and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> categories, subcategories (e.g. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) were assigned to denote the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Linking the ADAMS <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> clinical assessment data to the wealth of available longitudinal HRS data on health, health care utilization, informal care, and economic resources and behavior, will provide a unique opportunity to study the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of CIND and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in a nationally representative population-based sample, as well as the risk factors, prevalence, outcomes, and costs of CIND and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
