<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors of SCI in an apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adult population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine hundred ninety-four consecutive symptom-free adults (mean age 49.0+/-7.7; men:women 830:164) who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging at the Center for Health Promotion at Samsung Medical Center were assessed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 121 SCI lesions was observed in 58 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lesion prevalence adjusted for patient age was 5.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no gender difference in prevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ninety-nine lesions were &lt;1 cm in diameter, 15 were between 1 and 2 cm, 3 were between 2 and 3 cm, and 4 were &gt;3 cm in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most frequent site of the SCI lesion was basal ganglia, after which the periventricular white matter, cerebral cortex, and thalamus were the most frequent sites </plain></SENT>
