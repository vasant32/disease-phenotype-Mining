<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to examine the roles of the characteristic cognitive indicators and specific MRI-based measurements in the differential diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two probable AD patients were recruited for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven VaD patients and 35 age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> older adults (NC) were included as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects underwent a battery of standardized neuropsychological tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MRI-based quantification technique was used to measure the volumes and T2 relaxation time (T2) of medial temporal lobe structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stepwise discriminant analyses showed cognitive indicators had a sensitivity ranging from 82% to 100% and specificity from 82% to 97% for differentiating AD from non-AD cases (VaD and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls), and the quantitative MRI-based measurements of medial temporal lobe structures correctly classified AD cases from non-AD cases with sensitivity from 80% to 96% and specificity from 83% to 97% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ROC curve analyses showed that the combination of cognitive and MRI measurements slightly increased the diagnostic accuracy of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that both cognitive indicators and MRI-based medial temporal lobe measurements may be useful in differentiating AD from VaD and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> older adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combination of these possible indicators is promising in the early diagnosis of AD </plain></SENT>
