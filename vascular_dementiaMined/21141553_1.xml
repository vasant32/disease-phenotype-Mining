<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The escape latency (EL) of <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> (MWM) task was measured at different time points (4 W, 8 W and 16 W), and the population spikes (PS) of granule cell layer in the dentate gyrus were induced by single pulse stimulation to perfo rate path fibers before and after high frequency stimulation (HFS) in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MWM test showed that the escape latency (EL) of VD model group were highly longer than that of the sham-operated group, while the EL of EGb761-treated group was significantly shorter than that of model group, but still longer than that of the sham-operated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence rates of LTP induction in 1 m, 2 m and 4 m subgroups of model group were significantly lower than that of sham-operated group and EGb761-treated group at different time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relative amplitudes of PS after HFS in 1 m, 2 m and 4 m subgroups of model group were obviously reduced compared with that of the corresponding subgroups of sham-operated group and EGb761-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no obvious significance in the peak latency of PS between different subgroups and different LTP-tested time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: VD model rats had apparent and long-lasting dysfunction of learning and memory, EGb761 could accelerate the recovery of the pathological synaptic plasticity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggested that EGb761 played an important and improving role on learning and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory dysfunction</z:e> of VD </plain></SENT>
