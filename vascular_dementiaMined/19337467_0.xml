<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our retrospective investigation considered a case-series of 119 MCI subjects followed over a three-year period: their baseline clinical picture has been analyzed in search of correlation between the cognito-motor profile and the final diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The population included 66 patients with amnesic MCI and 53 with an involvement of other cognitive areas (nonamnesic MCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MPS were detected in 22 subjects (18.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the first observation, MPS cases showed an higher frequency of nonamnesic MCI and more pronounced deficits at the Trail Making Test (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a three-year follow-up, 48 patients had converted to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of MPS at the baseline evaluation was significantly related to the development of a vascular-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study investigates the association between MPS and MCI and might indicate for these cases a greater risk for an involvement of executive functions and the subsequent development of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
