<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A rapid and specific diagnostic test for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), the prevalent cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the elderly, is currently unavailable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to verify the validity of the recently proposed 'Eye Test' in the identification of AD patients, based on their supposed greater mydriatic response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48873">cholinergic antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the pupillary response to the instillation of 0.01% tropicamide in 48 subjects: 15 patients with probable or possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, five patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), 16 elderly controls (EC) and 12 young controls (YC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:mp ids='MP_0002546'>pupil dilation</z:mp> in the treated eye at 30 and 40 min after drops instillation was not significantly different among the four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean change in <z:hpo ids='HP_0009916'>anisocoria</z:hpo> at 30 min was significantly greater in the AD group (0.90 mm, S.D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>0.83) than in the YC group (0.21 mm, S.D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>0.46), but no significant difference was found among the AD group, the EC group and the VD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results, therefore, do not support the potential usefulness of the pupillary response to dilute tropicamide for identifying individuals with AD </plain></SENT>
