<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study has assessed the influence of treatment with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50075">dihydropyridine</z:chebi>-type <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> nicardipine on brain microanatomical changes in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SHR were treated from 16th to 26th week of age with hypotensive (3 mg/Kg/day) or non-hypotensive (0.1 mg/Kg/day) doses of nicardipine, with the non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50075">dihydropyridine</z:chebi>-type <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> hydralazine (10 mg/kg/day) or with vehicle (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Untreated age-matched Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were used as a normotensive reference group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain volume, number of neurons, glial fibrillary-acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactive astrocytes and neurofilament 200 KDa (NFP)-immunoreactivity (IR) were assessed in frontal and occipital cortex, hippocampus and striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A decrease of volume and number of nerve cells and a loss of NFP-IR was found in the frontal and occipital cortex and in the CA1 subfield of hippocampus and in the striatum of SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with nicardipine countered microanatomical changes occurring in SHR, whereas hydralazine displayed a less pronounced effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparatively, the non-hypotensive dose of nicardipine was less active than the hypotensive one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The observation that equihypotensive doses of nicardipine or hydralazine did not protect brain in the same way from hypertensive brain damage suggests that lowering blood pressure is per se not enough for affording neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The demonstration of neuroprotective effect of nicardipine suggests an use of the compound in situations in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is accompanied by the risk of brain damage </plain></SENT>
