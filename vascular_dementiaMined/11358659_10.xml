<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>MRI is a very sensitive imaging modality, however with relatively low specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to determine the potential of image post-processing using 3D-tissue segmentation technique for identification and quantitative characterization of intracranial lesions primarily in the white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty subjects participated in this study: 28 patients with brain multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS), 6 patients with subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (SIVD), and 6 patients with lacunar white matter <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (LI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In routine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging these pathologies may be almost indistinguishable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 3D-tissue segmentation technique used in this study was based on three input <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images (T(1), T(2)-weighted, and proton density) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A modified k-Nearest-Neighbor (k-NN) algorithm optimized for maximum computation speed and high quality segmentation was utilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In MS lesions, two very distinct subsets were classified using this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on the results of segmentation one subset probably represent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo>, and the other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In SIVD, the segmented images demonstrated homogeneity, which differentiates SIVD from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> observed in MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This homogeneity was in agreement with the general histological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The LI changes pathophysiologically from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The segmented images closely correlated with these changes, showing a central area of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> formation surrounded by an area that appears like reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> state, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> intensity was similar to that of CSF, while in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stage, the peripheral rim was more prominent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Regional brain lesion load were also obtained on one MS patient to demonstrate the potential use of this technique for lesion load measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The majority of lesions were identified in the parietal and occipital lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The follow-up study showed qualitatively and quantitatively that the calculated MS load increase was associated with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> represented by an increase in CSF volume as well as decrease in "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" brain tissue volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Importantly, these results were consistent with the patient's clinical evolution of the disease after a six-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these results show there is a potential application for a 3D tissue segmentation technique to characterize white matter lesions with similar intensities on T(2)-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The proposed methodology warrants further clinical investigation and evaluation in a large patient population </plain></SENT>
