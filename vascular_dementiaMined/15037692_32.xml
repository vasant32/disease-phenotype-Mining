<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To characterize the neuropsychological profile of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (VCI) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors examined 170 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> at 3 to 6 months after the vascular event, and 96 age-matched healthy controls, with detailed neuropsychological and medical-psychiatric assessments, with a majority (66.7%) undergoing MRI brain scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subjects were diagnosed as having VaD, VCI, or no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> by consensus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neuropsychological tests were classified into cognitive domains, and composite z-scores adjusted for age and education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VaD subjects had disturbance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cognitive domains, with verbal memory, especially retention, being less affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VCI subjects had similar but less severe disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The domains that best discriminated cognitively impaired from unimpaired patients were abstraction, mental flexibility, information processing speed, and working memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive impairment</z:hpo> had a significant correlation with deep white matter hyperintensities, but not with volume and number of infarctions, even though the VaD subjects had larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes than VCI subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The MRI variables did not provide additional discrimination between subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> in VaD and VCI are characterized by disturbance of frontal functions, with less verbal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>VaD and VCI differ in severity but not pattern of disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> that best account for these deficits are noninfarct subcortical white matter and gray matter changes due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The picture of VaD/VCI presented shows subcortical deficits embellished by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> from cortical infarctions </plain></SENT>
