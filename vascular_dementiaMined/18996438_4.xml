<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of CD40-signalling in incipient AD has not yet been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the plasma levels of soluble CD40 (sCD40) and the soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) at baseline in 136 subjects with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) and 30 age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty of the 136 MCI cases converted to AD (MCI-AD) during a clinical follow-up period of 4-7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The baseline levels of sCD40, but not sCD40L, were elevated in MCI-AD cases when compared to age-matched controls (Mann-Whitney U-test, p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, MCI patients who were cognitively stable or developed vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> during follow-up did not have significantly increased levels of sCD40 or sCD40L when compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The levels of sCD40 correlated to decreased baseline performance on mini-mental state examination (MMSE) in both controls (r(s)=-0.37, p&lt;0.05) and MCI-AD cases (r(s)=-0.29, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, the plasma levels of sCD40 correlated with the levels of soluble amyloid precursor protein-alpha (sAPP-alpha) (r(s)=0.28, p&lt;0.01) and sAPP-beta (r(s)=0.23, p&lt;0.05) in cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, CD40-signalling might play a role in the pathogenesis of early AD </plain></SENT>
