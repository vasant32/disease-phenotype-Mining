<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cytokine levels were related to neuronal damage, as measured by the intrathecal tau concentration, to cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> assessed by levels of Fas/<z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-1 and bcl-2, and to clinical variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro analysis was performed to study the effect of TNF-alpha on the production of bcl-2, an antiapoptotic factor, by human neuronal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with both AD and VAD displayed significantly higher intrathecal levels of TNF-alpha compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with AD showed significantly negative correlations between the intrathecal levels of TNF-alpha and the levels of Fas/<z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-1 as well as of tau protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The level of bcl-2 in supernatants of TNF-alpha-exposed cultures of human neuronal cells was up to three times higher than in control supernatants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrates intrathecal production of TNF-alpha in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>, suggesting that this cytokine may have a neuroprotective role in these neurodegenerative conditions as evidenced by negative correlations between this cytokine and (i) levels of intrathecal Fas/<z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-1 and (ii) levels of tau protein, both parameters closely related to brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our in vitro data suggest that TNF-alpha exerts its neuroprotective effect by stimulating neuronal cells to express bcl-2, a molecule which downregulates <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
