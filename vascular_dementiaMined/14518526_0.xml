<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects were 11 adult patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> (4 PVS, 7 VD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TCD mean velocity (Vm) in the middle and posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) and peak intensity (PI), area under curve (AUC), and mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) analyzed by HPI time-intensity curves in the bilateral temporal lobe (TL), basal ganglia (BG), and thalamus (Th) were evaluated before and after ACZ administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Resting values and relative changes (%delta) of TCD and HPI parameters were compared between PVS and VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: a) Resting values: There were no significant differences between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>b) Vasoreactivity: 1) PVS: %delta Vm decreased in the left <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>. %delta PI/AUC/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> decreased in the left TL and bilateral BG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>2) VD: %delta PI/AUC decreased in the right TL. %delta <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> tended to decrease in the right side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ACZ vasoreactivity tests by transcranial HPI and TCD allowed bedside, non-invasive, quantitative evaluation of the pathophysiology of cognitive function impairment and treatments, in relation to cerebrovascular reserve capacity in PVS and VD </plain></SENT>
