<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: The authors reported a retrospective study in the Memory Clinic, Siriraj Hospital between January 2001 and October 2003 including only patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rating (CDR) was used to document <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patterns of hypoperfusion were classified into no definite hypoperfusion, regional hypoperfusion, and diffused hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and seven patients were included in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only mean Thai Mental State Examination (TMSE) score was different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between pattern of hypoperfusion in brain SPECT and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The authors cannot demonstrate the pattern of hypoperfusion of 99-Tc <z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> SPECT among patients' difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity </plain></SENT>
