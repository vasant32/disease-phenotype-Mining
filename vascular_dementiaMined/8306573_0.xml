<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The typical neuroradiologic pattern has been found in 62 of the 1804 CT scans of the department's archive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Available patients were enrolled for neuropsychologic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors point out that there is no correlation whatever between severity of the CT pattern and findings of psychological decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore SAE may be considered merely a neuroradiologic pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The discrepancy between neuroradiologic and clinical pattern depends on the individual history of every single patient as well as on the quality of the neuronal cells involved in vascular pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It may in fact be thought that the injury to command neurones plays a fundamental role in bringing about the psychopathologic picture </plain></SENT>
