<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>11 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly (mean age, 66.9 years), 11 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer's type (DAT: mean age, 70.5), and four with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (mean age, 79.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MLSEPs in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly showed an increase in the latency of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33479">P22</z:chebi>, N30, P45, N60, and P100, and in the amplitude of N60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DAT patients also presented such changes; however, the increase in the amplitude of N60 was much more evident than that found in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aging and was accompanied by a significant increase in amplitude of P45 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> tended to show longer latencies and larger amplitudes than the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increase in amplitude of P45 and N60 in MLSEPs seems to be characteristically associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aging and the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the mechanism of such functional changes might be correlated with the structural and neurochemical changes accompanying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> in these conditions </plain></SENT>
