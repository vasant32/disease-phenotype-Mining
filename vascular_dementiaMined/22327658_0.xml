<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have defined a novel cerebral hemodynamic index, a time constant of the cerebral arterial bed (τ), the product of arterial compliance (C(a)) and cerebrovascular resistance (CVR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>C(a) and CVR were calculated based on the relationship between pulsatile arterial blood pressure (ABP) and transcranial Doppler cerebral blood flow velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This new parameter theoretically estimates how fast the cerebral arterial bed is filled by blood volume after a sudden change in ABP during one cardiac cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have explored this concept in 11 volunteers and in 25 patients with severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An additional group of 15 subjects with non-vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was studied to assess potential age dependency of τ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The τ was shorter (p = 0.011) in ICA stenosis, both unilateral (τ = 0.18 ± 0.04 s) and bilateral (τ = 0.16 ± 0.03 s), than in controls (τ = 0.22 ± 0.0 s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The τ correlated with the degree of stenosis (R = -0.62, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In controls, τ was independent of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further study during cerebrovascular reactivity tests is needed to establish the usefulness of τ for quantitative estimation of haemodynamics in cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
