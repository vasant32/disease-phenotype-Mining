<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To confirm that the HIS can be used to differentiate related VaD from AD in a Thai population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective study of 398 patients who were attending the Memory Clinic, at Siriraj Hospital between January 2001 and October 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 214 patients, with a mean age of 71.15 + 10.20 years, were classified as AD, VaD or mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD with cerebrovascular disease) in proportion of 60.2%, 30.4%, and 9.3% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors propose HIS at 5 as a cut off point to differentiate patients with AD and those with VaD or AD with cerebrovascular disease with sensitivity of 85.3% and specificity of 72.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The HIS can be applied to differentiate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> related vascular etiology from AD in a Thai population </plain></SENT>
