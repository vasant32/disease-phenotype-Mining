<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reductions in the AMPA receptor GluR2 subunit are well-established in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), but the status of GluR2 in subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (SIVD) and mixed AD/SIVD (MIX) has not been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we measured GluR2 immunoreactivity and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in the postmortem neocortex of a longitudinally assessed cohort of SIVD and MIX, together with age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that GluR2 immunoreactivity and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were up-regulated in SIVD, but remained unchanged in MIX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, higher GluR2 immunoreactivity was associated with milder <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and lower concentrations of AÎ²42 peptide and phosphorylated tau </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that GluR2 up-regulation may be an adaptive process in SIVD, and that this process is repressed in the presence of concomitant AD in mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
