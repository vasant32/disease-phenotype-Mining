<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subjects from Family A were virtually asymptomatic, and yet showed MRI pathological findings and a cluster of sub-clinical neuropsychological defects mainly centred on the visuospatial domain; patients from Family B had presented several clinically relevant episodes and showed a general <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> compatible with the clinical picture of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present clinical observations are consistent with the hypothesis of a geographical clustering for CADASIL, and highlight that sub-clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> may help to identify this syndrome in families presenting with only <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
