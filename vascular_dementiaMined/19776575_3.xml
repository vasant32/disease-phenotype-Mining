<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined cholinergic function at postmortem, focussing on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Post-mortem brain tissue was studied from 61 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or VaD (13 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; 8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; 11 sub-cortical ischaemic VaD, SIVD; 29 VaD and concurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, AD), 12 patients with AD and 23 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">Choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase (ChAT) was measured in Brodmann areas (BA) 9 and 20/21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were significant reductions in ChAT activity in patients with VaD and concurrent AD compared to age-matched controls (BA9: t = 2.7, p = 0.009; BA20/21: t = 4.67, p = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, there was a significant 27% increase in ChAT activity in BA9 (t = 2.1, p = 0.047), but not in BA20/21 (t = 1.67, p = 0.106), compared to the age-matched control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no relationship between ChAT activity and cognition in the VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Loss of cholinergic function is only evident in VaD patients with concurrent AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A novel increase in cholinergic activity was identified in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, which may create important new treatment opportunities </plain></SENT>
