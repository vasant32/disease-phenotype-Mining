<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to demonstrate the effects and mechanisms of this compound through in vitro and in vivo experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Culture experiments were performed by adding <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>) to SH-SY5Y cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay result, enhanced cell survival was observed with DL-NBP treatment, regardless of whether they are added before, simultaneously with or after the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the in vivo experiment, Spontaneously Hypertensive rats and Wistar Kyoto control rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, which were induced by bilateral transection of the common carotid arteries, were given DL-NBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their performances in the place navigation test and spatial probe test in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris Water Maze</z:mp> have significantly improved compared with the DL-NBP untreated animals, indicating an improvement in spatial learning and memory in the ischemic-animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, in the chick embryonic chorioallantoic membrane assay, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> was more vigorous under the effects of DL-NBP, together with increased expression of growth factors, VEGF, VEGF-receptor and bFGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these suggested that one of the mechanisms of DL-NBP might be ameliorating vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and promoting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
