<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with VaD (NINDS-AIREN) were included in a large multicenter treatment trial (the VantagE study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were examined by a neurologist and interviewed about their medical history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on MRI, patients were classified as having large vessel VaD, small vessel VaD, or a combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other MRI characteristics included white matter hyperintensities (WMH), medial temporal lobe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (MTA) and general <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 706 patients, 522 (74 %) had small vessel disease, 126 (18 %) had large vessel disease and 58 (8 %) had both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with small vessel disease were older and less educated, and showed more cortical and medial temporal lobe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> than patients with large vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most prevalent vascular risk factors (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and smoking) were equally distributed between the different types of VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, patients with large vessel disease had more <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> and cardiac risk factors compared to patients with small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cerebrovascular disease underlying VaD consists in the majority of small vessel disease and in about one fifth of large vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> between these two groups with regard to risk factor profile and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> scores on MRI </plain></SENT>
