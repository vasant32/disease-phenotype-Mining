<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The intrathecal levels of these molecules were related to the clinical severity of these diseases and to the intrathecal levels of beta-amyloid protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significantly increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of both VEGF and TGF-beta were observed in 20 patients with AD and in 26 patients with VAD compared to healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, there was significant correlation between the CSF levels of TGF-beta and VEGF in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the individuals studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrates, both in patients with AD and in patients with VAD, an intrathecal production of VEGF, a cytokine which plays a pivotal role in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that vascular factors might not only play a role in the pathogenesis of VAD but also in the pathogenesis of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we show in AD and VAD an intrathecal production of TGF-beta, a cytokine exerting on one hand anti-inflammatory and angiogenic properties, but on the other promoting amyloidogenesis </plain></SENT>
