<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) of acupoint recipe for "dredging Governor-Meridian, regulating vitality and strengthening the kidney" on learning-memory ability and pathological changes of cerebral minute blood vessels and hippocampal structure in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>-hyperlipmia-vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (HH-VD) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty SD rats were randomly divided into sham-operation (sham) group (n=8), EA-I group [n=8, EA of "Baihui" (GV 20), "Dazhui" (GV 14), "Pishu" (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> 20) and "Shenshu" (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> 23), 80 Hz, 1 mA, 20 min/day, 15 days], EA-II group (n=8, EA of nonpoints, 5 mm lateral to the abovementioned acupoints), medication group (n=8, intragastric perfusion of Nimotong, 0.6 mg/mL, 20 mL/kg, 15 days), model group (n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HH-VD model was established by feeding the rat with high fat forage and by occlusion of the left renal artery and carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals' learning-memory ability was detected by Y-maze test, the synaptic structure of the hippocampal CA 1 region, and the pathological change of the cerebral cortex were observed by electronic microscope and light microscope, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After modeling, the blood pressure, serum total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (TG) levels, and the error number (EN), total reaction time (TRT) and standard number (SN, number of paw-electric-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> for reaching correct reactions) of Y maze test increased significantly in comparison with sham group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After EA, the EN, TRT and SN of EA-I , EA-II and medication groups decreased significantly in comparison with model group (P&lt;0.01), suggesting a striking improvement of the learning-memory ability after the treatment, and the EN, TRT and SN of EA-I group and medication group were significantly lower than those of EA-II group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Under electronic microscope, the number of synapses in hippocampal CA 1 area of HH-VD model rats reduced obviously, its postsynaptic density (PSD) was lighter, and the synaptic vesicles were fewer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whereas in comparison with EA-II and medication groups, the synaptic number and density in EA-I group were more and bigger, and the width, length and color of PSD increased clearly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The synaptic number of EA-II group was relatively smaller compared with the other two treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Under light microscope, the vascular walls of the cerebral minute and small arteries of model group were obviously thickened and their lumina narrowed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While in EA-I group, these pathological changes were mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In medication group the thickening of vascular walls of partial cerebral minute and small arteries were also seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EA of acupoint recipe for "dredging Governor-Meridian, regulating vitality and strengthening the kidney" can improve pathological changes of the synaptic structure of hippocampal CA 1 region and the vascular walls of cerebral minute and small arteries, which may contribute to its function in improving the learning-memory ability in HH-VD rats </plain></SENT>
