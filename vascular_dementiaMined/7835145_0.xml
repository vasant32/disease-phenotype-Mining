<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>42.92% of them were shown to have cognitive defect with a series of neuropsychological tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Correlation of the occurrence of cognitive defect with the CT findings such as the location and extent of focal lesions as well as the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> or subcortical degeneration were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to the results by multiple regression and factor analysis, the location and extent of the focal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> lesions were not the primary determining factor for the occurrence of cognitive defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is, therefore, suggested that the term of ischemic or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> be used clinically instead of the so-called multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
