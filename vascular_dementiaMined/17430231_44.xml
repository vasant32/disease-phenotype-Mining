<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unknown if there is a difference in the risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) versus vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001260'>high body weight</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to examine the association between midlife BMI and risk of both AD and VaD an average of 36 years later in a large (N= 10,136) and diverse cohort of members of a health care delivery system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants aged 40-45 participated in health exams between 1964 and 1968 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AD and VaD diagnoses were obtained from Neurology visits between January 1, 1994 and June 15, 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those with diagnoses of general <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> from primary care providers were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BMI was analyzed in WHO categories of underweight, overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, as well as in subdivisions of WHO categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> models were fully adjusted for age, education, race, sex, marital status, smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazard models showed that compared to those with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BMI (18.5-24.9), those <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI &gt; or = 30) at midlife had a 3.10 fold increase in risk of AD (fully adjusted model, Hazard Ratio=3.10, 95% CI 2.19-4.38), and a five fold increase in risk of VaD (fully adjusted model, HR=5.01, 95% CI 2.98-8.43) while those overweight ( BMI &gt; or = 25 and &lt;30) had a two fold increase in risk of AD and VaD (fully adjusted model, HR=2.09, 95% CI 1.69-2.60 for AD and HR=1.95, 95% CI 1.29-2.96 for VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that midlife BMI is strongly predictive of both AD and VaD, independent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, cardiovascular and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> co morbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future studies need to unveil the mechanisms between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and excess risk of AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
