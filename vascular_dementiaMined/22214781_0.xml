<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we used a flow cytometric approach for the detection and assessment of oligomers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from AD patients and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>30 CSF samples from patients suffering from AD (n = 14), non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> controls (n = 12), and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo>, n = 2; vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, n = 1; primary progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, n = 1) were analyzed for the presence of Aβ-oligomers by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CSF levels of total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and amyloid-β (Aβ)42 were determined using ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSF Aβ-oligomer levels in AD patients were elevated in comparison to the non-AD group (p = 0.073) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ratio Aβ-oligomers/Aβ42 was significantly elevated in AD subjects compared to non-AD subjects (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most important, there was a negative correlation between the amount of Aβ-oligomers and the Mini-Mental Status Exam score (r = -0.65; p = 0.013) in AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The detection of Aβ-oligomers using flow cytometry analysis seems to be useful in assessing the stage of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is a novel and important finding as none of the currently used CSF biomarkers are clearly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity </plain></SENT>
