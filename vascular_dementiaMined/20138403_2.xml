<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Since groundbreaking studies demonstrated the presence of progenitor cells in the adult human brain, there have been intense interests in their potential therapeutic application, but to date only limited data has been obtained in man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An immunohistological study was performed in order to examine neurogenesis in both the subventricular and peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zones of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients compared to age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results were striking, showing a significant increase of progenitor cells in both the subventricular zone and in peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> compared to controls, which was sustained even in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> occurring more than three months prior to autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> response appeared to be unified with that of the subventricular zone via a stream of cells, with some of them differentiating into immature neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that neurogenesis is stimulated in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients and, specifically, in patients with visible <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Progenitors may migrate from the neurogenic niche to areas of infarction and differentiate into neurons, even three months after cerebrovascular damage, thus implicating the feasibility of enhancing neurogenesis as a novel treatment approach </plain></SENT>
