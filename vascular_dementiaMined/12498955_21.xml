<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of strategic areas of the brain involved in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> induced by vascular lesions and their relative contributions to the severity of the dementing process remain poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined the relationship between the severity of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and the volume of different brain areas affected by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in a prospective clinicopathological study in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A volumetric study of the functional zones of Mesulam's human brain map affected by vascular lesions was made and correlations between quantified neuropathological data and the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were performed in cases with large vascular lesions only, pure AD, and both lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> was significantly correlated with the total volume of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> but in a multi-variate model the volume destroyed in the limbic and heteromodal association areas, including the frontal cortex and in the white matter explained 50% of the variability in MMSE and GDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total volume of ischemic lesions explained only 0.1-5% of the variability in MMSE and GDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age only explained an extra of 0.1-1.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study confirms that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> located in strategic areas have a role in the mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and brings a key for their quantification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It may be useful for developing neuropathological criteria in multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
