<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study comprised 10 patients with senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> who received music therapy; six had Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and four had vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Music therapy was performed twice a week for 8 consecutive weeks (16 sessions) </plain></SENT>
