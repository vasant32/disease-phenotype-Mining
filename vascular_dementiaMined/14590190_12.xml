<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite the emergence of a number of new classification systems, the diagnosis of cerebrovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Also controversial is the significance of periventricular and deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter alterations</z:hpo> (WMA) as seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To further clarify this issue, MRI scans were used to regroup patients clinically diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) or subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (IVD) into cohorts presenting with either little versus significant WMA on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These two groups were then compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">idiopathic Parkinson's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) using a comprehensive neuropsychological protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological assessment failed to distinguish between patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> and significant WMA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, both of these patient groups exhibited disproportionate impairment on tests of executive systems functioning, whereas patients with little WMA showed greater impairment on tests of declarative memory and semantic knowledge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings constitute further evidence that the pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> associated with significant WMA is distinctly different when compared to AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results are discussed within the context of a growing body of literature suggesting that elements of the underlying neuropathologies in AD and IVD are linked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Implications for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are also discussed </plain></SENT>
