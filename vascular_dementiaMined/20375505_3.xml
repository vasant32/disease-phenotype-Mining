<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The APOE epsilon4 allele is an established risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, but reports of its association with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) have been inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the relationship between APOE epsilon4 allele and the risk of incident VaD in a large, population-based cohort of elderly adults with up to 10 years of follow-up between 1995 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 3,424 elderly men and women free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were genotyped at the baseline assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incident VaD was identified through standardized procedures administered at 3 follow-up assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the risk of VaD associated with APOE epsilon4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The adjusted hazard ratio was 1.6 for the participants with 1 APOE epsilon4 allele (95% CI: 0.9-2.7; p = 0.083) and 4.4 for those with 2 APOE epsilon4 alleles (95% CI: 1.6-12.5; p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increased risk did not appear to be mediated by vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The APOE epsilon4 allele is associated with an increased risk of VaD in a dose-dependent fashion and accounts for almost 20% of VaD in the population </plain></SENT>
