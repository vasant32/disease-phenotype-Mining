<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore we enumerated the numbers and proportions of the CD3-, CD4- and CD8-positive cells and B-lymphocytes in peripheral blood of 136 patients with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> of the brain and 58 healthy age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The selective decrease of the CD8-positive lymphocytes was demonstrated in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in the patients with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of unknown origin and in the patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> the number of the CD8-positive cells tended to increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that brain degenerative changes are associated with changes in the systemic immunity and the changes are linked with the underlying disorder more than brain degeneration per se </plain></SENT>
