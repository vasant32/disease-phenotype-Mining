<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: Previous work combining the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Informant Questionnaire on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>Cognitive Decline</z:hpo> in the Elderly (IQCODE) has been conducted in western populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We ascertained, in an Asian population, (1) the best method of combining the tests, (2) the effects of educational level, and (3) the effect of different <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from 576 patients were analyzed (407 nondemented controls, 87 Alzheimer's disease and 82 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity and AUC values were obtained using three methods, the 'And' rule, the 'Or' rule, and the 'weighted sum' method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 'weighted sum' rule had statistically superior AUC and specificity results, while the 'Or' rule had the best sensitivity results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IQCODE outperformed the MMSE in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with no education benefited more from combined tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> populations in the predictive value of any of the combined methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We recommend that the IQCODE be used to supplement the MMSE whenever available and that the 'weighted sum' method be used to combine the MMSE and the IQCODE, particularly in populations with low education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As the study population selected may not be representative of the general population, further studies are required before generalization to nonclinical samples </plain></SENT>
