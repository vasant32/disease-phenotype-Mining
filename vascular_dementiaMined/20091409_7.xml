<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to characterize myelin loss as one of the features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter abnormalities</z:hpo> across three common dementing disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated post-mortem brain tissue from frontal and temporal lobes from 20 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), 19 Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 31 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>) cases and 12 comparable age controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Images of sections stained with conventional luxol fast blue were analysed to estimate myelin attenuation by optical density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial adjacent sections were then immunostained for degraded myelin basic protein (dMBP) and the mean percentage area containing dMBP (%dMBP) was determined as an indicator of myelin degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We further assessed the relationship between dMBP and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase (a marker of mature oligodendrocytes) immunoreactivities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pathological diagnosis significantly affected the frontal but not temporal lobe myelin attenuation: myelin density was most reduced in VaD compared to AD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>, which still significantly exhibited lower myelin density compared to ageing controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this, the degree of myelin loss was correlated with greater %dMBP, with the highest %dMBP in VaD compared to the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The %dMBP was inversely correlated with the mean size of oligodendrocytes in VaD, whereas it was positively correlated with their density in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A two-tier regression model analysis confirmed that the type of disorder (VaD or AD) determines the relationship between %dMBP and the size or density of oligodendrocytes across the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings, attested by the use of three markers, suggest that myelin loss may evolve in parallel with shrunken oligodendrocytes in VaD but their increased density in AD, highlighting partially different mechanisms are associated with myelin degeneration, which could originate from hypoxic-ischaemic damage to oligodendrocytes in VaD whereas secondary to <z:mp ids='MP_0005405'>axonal degeneration</z:mp> in AD </plain></SENT>
