<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty patients with VD, 45 patients with LOAD, and 54 non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> controls were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No differences in the distribution of paraoxonase, ACE, and MTHFR polymorphisms were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall frequency of apo E epsilon4 allele was "low"; epsilon4 allele was more frequent in LOAD (17.5%) and VD (13.3%) compared with controls (9.2%), but the difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Paraoxonase, ACE, and MTHFR polymorphisms were not associated with VD or LOAD; these common polymorphisms might have a marginal role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in older subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In spite of a "low" frequency of the apo E epsilon4 allele in our sample, the frequency of epsilon4 allele was about double in LOAD compared with controls </plain></SENT>
