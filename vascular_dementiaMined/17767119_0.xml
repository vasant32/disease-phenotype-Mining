<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It remains an open issue in old age psychiatry whether or not persons with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) are at increased risk for developing a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> syndrome, and if so, to what extent and under what circumstances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to examine a population of older patients 5 years after a diagnosis of MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL/METHODS: From an initial group of 158 older patients from our clinic who had been tested neuropsychologically and diagnosed with MCI between 1994 and 1996, and who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 52 were available for follow-up five years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 52 subjects we successfully recruited, 12 had developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> within the five-year follow-up period, including 8 with DAT, 3 with mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 1 with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> is a good predictor of later <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MCI are at some risk of developing a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> syndrome, most commonly DAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evaluating both the cognitive and neuropsychological functioning of individuals affected with MCI, as well as their global functioning, can be useful in terms of predicting the clinical outcome in these patients </plain></SENT>
