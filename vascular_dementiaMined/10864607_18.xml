<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CSF concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24402">glycosphingolipid</z:chebi> (sulfatide), proteins (neurofilament triplet protein (NFL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)), neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (VIP), 4-aminobutyric acid (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>)), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25375">monoamines</z:chebi> (homovanillic acid (HVA), 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylglycol (HMPG)) were analysed in 43 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> and 19 patients with SAE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnoses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> and SAE were based on strict criteria and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> were subsequently operated on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve clinical variables, psychometric tests measuring perceptual speed, accuracy, learning, and memory and a psychiatric evaluation were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and before and after a shunt operation in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The CSF sulfatide concentration was markedly increased in patients with SAE (mean 766, range 300-3800 nmol/l) compared with patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> (mean 206, range 50-400 nmol/l) (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>5-HIAA, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>, and VIP in CSF were higher in patients with SAE than in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> with cerebrovascular aetiology had higher sulfatide concentrations and a poorer outcome after shunt surgery than patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> with other aetiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The pathogenesis of the white matter changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> and SAE is different and ischaemic white matter changes can be a part of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The markedly increased CSF sulfatide concentrations in patients with SAE indicate ongoing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> as an important pathophysiological feature of SAE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The CSF sulfatide concentration distinguished between patients with SAE and those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> with a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 94%, making it an important diagnostic marker </plain></SENT>
