<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2781">4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyacetophenone</z:chebi> (HMAP), a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50423">NADPH oxidase inhibitor</z:chebi> and Pitavastatin, HMG Co-A reductase inhibitor, on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">Streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> induced vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">Donepezil</z:chebi> served as a positive control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats were administered with single dose of STZ for the induction of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Drug treatment was started after one month of STZ administration and treatment was continued till the end of the study (i.e. 56th day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On 52nd day onwards, the animals were exposed to <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water-maze</z:mp> (MWM) for testing learning &amp; memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, bodyweight, vascular endothelial function, serum <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> / nitrate levels, aortic &amp; brain <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> levels and brain acetylcholinesterase activity were also tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>STZ treated animals performed poorly on MWM hence reflecting impairment of learning &amp; memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further STZ treatment also produced a reduction in body weight, impairment of vascular endothelial function, decrease in serum <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> / nitrate levels, along with increase in serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, aortic &amp; brain <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> levels and brain acetylcholinesterase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment of HMAP, Pitavastatin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">Donepezil</z:chebi> significantly reversed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> induced learning and memory, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e>, and changes in various biochemical levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It may be concluded that STZ induces vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>4'hydroxy-3'-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32772">methoxy</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27632">acetophenone</z:chebi> and Pitavastatin may be considered as potential pharmacological agents for the management of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> induced vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
