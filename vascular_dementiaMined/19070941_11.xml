<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: There is evidence supporting that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor receptor (TNFR)-signaling can induce production of beta-amyloid (Aβ) in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, amyloid-induced toxicity has been shown to be dependent on TNFR-signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is still unclear whether TNFRs are involved in the early stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed soluble TNFR1 and TNFR2 levels in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at baseline in 137 patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) and 30 age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MCI patients were followed for 4-6 years with an incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) of 15% per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients with MCI who subsequently developed these forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> had higher levels of sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 in both CSF and plasma already at baseline when compared to age-matched controls (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the CSF of MCI subjects and controls the levels of both sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 correlated strongly with β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) activity (r(s)=0.53-0.68, p&lt;0.01) and Aβ 40 levels (r(s)=0.59-0.71, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, both sTNFRs were associated with Aβ 40 (r(s)=0.39-0.46, p&lt;0.05) in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, the levels of both sTNFRs correlated with the axonal damage marker tau in the CSF of MCI subjects and controls (r(s)=0.57-0.83, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TNFR-signaling might be involved in the early pathogenesis of AD and VaD, and could be associated with beta-amyloid metabolism </plain></SENT>
