<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to evaluate expression of IGF-1 signaling in hippocampus in rat model of VaD, and probe the underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Permanent occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries (2-VO) was used as VaD model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Learning and memory functions were declined significantly in 2-VO rats, and these impairments were further deteriorated with the prolongation of 2-VO treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IGF-1, IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), total Akt and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measured at 1, 2 and 4 months following 2-VO injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with controls, IGF-1, IGF-1 mRNA and p-Akt expression were significantly decreased in hippocampus of 2-VO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, changes of IGF-1R and total Akt levels were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that down-regulation of IGF-1 and p-Akt may contribute to the impairments of learning and memory functions after 2-VO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling system may involved in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and development of VaD </plain></SENT>
