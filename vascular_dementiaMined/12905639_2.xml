<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The serum levels of M-CSF in 70 patients with AD, 52 healthy controls, 22 patients with VAD (vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) were measured and the serum levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha in 32 patients with AD and 20 controls were measured as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum levels of M-CSF were significantly elevated in patients with AD when compared with healthy controls (P &lt; 0.01) and VAD controls (P &lt; 0.05) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the early stage of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and middle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, serum levels of M-CSF were significantly elevated, but at the later stage of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, they returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of IL-1 beta were significantly elevated in AD patients compared with controls (P &lt; 0.05), and serum levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 were within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in patients with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that serum M-CSF level may provide a convenient and sensitive means for the early diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
