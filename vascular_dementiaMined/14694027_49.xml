<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The role of blood pressure (BP) as a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is complex and may be age dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In very old individuals, low BP might increase risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, perhaps by reducing cerebral perfusion pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The association between BP and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was examined in the Bronx Aging Study, a prospective study of 488 community-dwelling elderly individuals over age 75, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-free at baseline (1980 to 1983) and followed at 12- to 18-month intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects with baseline BP and with at least one follow-up visit were included (n = 406) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was diagnosed using the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e> (3rd rev. ed.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over 21 years (median 6.7 years), 122 subjects developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (65 Alzheimer's disease [AD], 28 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 29 other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> increased for each 10-mm Hg decrement in diastolic (hazard ratio [HR] 1.20, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.40) and mean arterial (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.32) pressure, adjusted for age, sex, and education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Low diastolic BP significantly influenced risk of developing AD but not vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Upon examination of groups defined by BP, mildly to moderately raised systolic BP (140 to 179 mm Hg) was associated with reduced risk for AD (HR vs <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> systolic BP group 0.55, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.96), whereas low diastolic BP (&lt;or=70 mm Hg) was associated with increased risk of AD (HR vs <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diastolic BP group 1.91, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subjects with persistent low BP over 2 years had higher risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (HR 2.19, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low diastolic pressure is associated with higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in elderly individuals over age 75 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> risk was higher in subjects with persistently low BP </plain></SENT>
