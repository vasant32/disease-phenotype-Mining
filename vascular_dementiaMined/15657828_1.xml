<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The "experience-based" evaluation is insufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rating scales may contribute to reproducible quantification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In MRI studies of 10 patients, 9 neuroradiologists quantified vascular white matter lesions (WMLs) at two different points in time for 12 anatomically defined regions with respect to number, size and localization (score) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For 9 observers and 10 studies, 90 intra-observer differences were obtained for each of the 12 WML scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To calculate the inter-observer reliability, rating pairs were formed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 360 differences were computed for each score and rating for 12 anatomically defined WML scores, and the intraclass correlation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e>) was calculated as a measure of agreement (reliability) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As to the intra-observer reliability, the median of the differences was 1.5 for the entire brain as opposed to 0 for defined brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The corresponding values for the inter-observer reliability were 3 and 1, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean intra-class correlation coefficient for the 10 studies was 0.88, whereas the mean interclass correlation concerning the inter-observer reliability was 0.70, with the first and second rating being averaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rating of each study took about 6 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The rating scale with high intra- and inter-observer reliability can dependably quantify WMLs and correlates with the clinical diagnosis of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Using a reliable rating scale, the diagnostic distinction of age-associated physiological vs. pathological size of the WML can make a contribution to the reproducible quantifiable diagnostic evaluation of vascular brain tissue lesions within the framework of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnostics </plain></SENT>
