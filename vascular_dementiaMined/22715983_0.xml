<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, 302 demented patients, 166 with AD and 136 with VaD, were evaluated for NPS according to the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) score at the Alzheimer's Evaluation Unit of Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza Hospital-IRCCS, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive geriatric assessment was also performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The means of NPI scores did not differ in two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall prevalence of NPS was similar in both groups of patients (69.7% vs. 69.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with AD had higher frequency in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo>/lability than VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic analysis demonstrated a significant association between severity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013473" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">eating disorders</z:e> in both AD and VaD patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both AD and VaD patients, there was a significant association between the impairment in activities of daily living (ADL) and the majority of NPI domains </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In particular, a causal mediation analysis was performed to better understand whether the relationship of NPS to functional impairment was direct or mediated by severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e>, i.e., Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rating scale (CDR) score </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The NPI-Distress scores showed a significantly higher levels of distress in caregivers of AD than VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences between AD and VaD patients with NPS, and these symptoms varied according to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtype and severity and induced marked disability in ADL and IADL, increasing, prevalently, the distress of the caregivers of AD patients </plain></SENT>
