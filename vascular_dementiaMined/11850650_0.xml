<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The multiple-dose pharmacokinetics and safety of a new potential antidementia compound, CL 275,838, were examined in two randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer Disease</z:hpo> Assessment Scale (ADAS) was employed to preliminarily assess the patients' cognitive and the behavioral profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first study, nine patients with Alzheimer type or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were treated for 2 weeks with daily doses of 50 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the second study, nine other patients, selected with the same inclusion/exclusion criteria and treated following the same experimental design, were given 100 mg day(minus sign1) CL 275,838 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the lower dose, no side effects were detected; in the 100-mg day(minus sign1) study, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002329'>drowsiness</z:hpo> (one patient) and moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> (two patients) were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Laboratory tests showed no changes in either study, apart from a slight, transient increase in serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> in one patient given 100 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the dose of 50 mg, no patients showed any modification on the ADAS, whereas three patients given 100 mg showed some improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the 2 weeks of oral dosing, predose plasma concentrations of the parent compounds and its metabolites II and IV increased but not in proportion to the dose, although at both doses, accumulation was essentially complete within 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 50 mg, the mean steady-state C(max) and C(ss) of the parent compound were similar to those reached in young males after a comparable regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean steady-state metabolite-to-parent drug ratios were higher in patients than in healthy individuals, although there was wide variation in our patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean washout t(1/2) of the parent compound (34 h) and its metabolites II (37 h) and IV (41 h) were longer than in young men and were similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases to those observed after single doses in healthy elderly subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After 100 mg, mean C(max) and C(ss) of the unchanged compound rose more than proportionally and the apparent t(1/2) tended to rise, compared with the lower dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mean steady-state oral clearance decreased, changing the metabolite-to-parent drug ratios, suggesting nonlinear kinetics after several relatively high oral doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This might explain why the higher dose was less well tolerated </plain></SENT>
