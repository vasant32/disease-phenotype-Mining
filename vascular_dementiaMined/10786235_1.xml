<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the population aged 65-84 years of the Warsaw district Mokot√≥w, the stratified sample consisted of 1,000 persons taken randomly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first-screening phase (MMSE) was conducted by raters among 893 persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>92 subjects with disturbances of cognitive functions were qualified to the second-diagnostic phase and 89 were given a diagnostic examination with the Cambridge <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e> of the Elderly Examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following age-specific prevalences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were found in the age-groups 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80-84: 1.9, 5.8, 8.6 and 16.5% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rates for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (2.7) were higher than those for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer's type (2.3), mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (0.5), and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (0.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the younger subgroups (65-74 y), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was the most frequent and in the older subgroups (75-84 y) the most frequent was Alzheimer's type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were quite similar to those found in other European studies </plain></SENT>
