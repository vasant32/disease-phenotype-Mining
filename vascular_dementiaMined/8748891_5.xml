<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to characterize metabolic changes in the white matter of elderly subjects with extensive WMSH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used water-suppressed proton (1H) magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to compare six subjects with extensive WMSH with eight age-matched elderly subjects with minimal or absent WMSH, and <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37971">31P</z:chebi>) MRSI to compare nine subjects with extensive WMSH and seven age-matched elderly subjects without extensive WMSH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relative to region-matched tissue in elderly controls, extensive WMSH were associated with increased signal from <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi>-containing metabolites, no significant change of signal from N-acetylaspartate, and a trend to a decreased phosphomonoester (PME) resonance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that WMSH may be associated with an alteration of brain myclin <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> in the absence of axonal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in energy phosphates, consistent with lack of ongoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within the group with extensive WMSH, PME resonance measures were significantly lower in WMSH than in contralateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results provide information on pathophysiology of WMSH and a basis for comparison with WMSH in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, and other diseases </plain></SENT>
