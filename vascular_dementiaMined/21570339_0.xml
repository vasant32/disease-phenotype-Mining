<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, that has not been widely investigated in the vascular-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD)- related studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to explore the differences of brain functional states between VaD patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls while performing a detection task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three multichannel linear descriptors, i.e. spatial complexity (Ω), field strength (Σ) and frequency of field changes (Φ), were applied to analyse four frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha and beta) of multichannel event-related EEG signals for 12 VaD patients (mean age ± SD: 69.25 ± 10.56 years ; MMSE score ± SD: 22.58 ± 4.42) and 12 age-matched healthy subjects (mean age ± SD: 67.17 ± 5.97 years ; MMSE score ± SD: 29.08 ± 0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correlations between the three measures and MMSE scores were also analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VaD patients showed a significant higher Ω value in the delta (p = 0.013) and theta (p = 0.021) frequency bands, a lower Σ value (p = 0.011) and a higher Φ (p = 0.008) value in the delta frequency band compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The MMSE scores were negatively correlated with the Ω (r = -0.52, p = 0.01) and Φ (r = -0.47, p = 0.02) values in the delta frequency band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated the VaD patients presented a reduction of synchronization in the slow frequency band during target detection, and suggested more neurons might be activated in VaD patients compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Ω and Φ measures in the delta frequency band might be used to evaluate the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: The multichannel linear descriptors are promising measures to reveal the differences in brain functions between VaD patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, and could potentially be used to evaluate the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> in VaD patients </plain></SENT>
