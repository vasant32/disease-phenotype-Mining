<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bipolar EEGs were recorded from central, parietal, occipital and temporal areas in 24 elderly patients with a firm clinical diagnosis of senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Power and coherence spectra were computed on 20 second epochs recorded during eyes open, eyes closed and photic stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant group differences were reported in both power and coherence measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Power results were uniform for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> channels but coherence values differed significantly with derivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The best discriminator between groups was EEG coherence estimates between right parietal and temporal derivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correlations between clinical symptomatology and EEG coherence supported the direction of the discrimination between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The EEG coherence function is discussed as a potential measure of neuro-functional pathology in psychiatry </plain></SENT>
