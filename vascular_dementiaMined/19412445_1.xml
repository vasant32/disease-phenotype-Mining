<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Studies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mental disorders</z:e> using single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) have been done for many years in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many results have been obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We review these findings and introduce them to the outside world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SPECT papers available on the Chinese Biomedical Bibliographic Database, focusing on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> disorder, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000722'>obsessive compulsive disorder</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OCD</z:e>) in China, were reviewed and the results were compared with those obtained outside China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was abnormal in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mental disorders</z:e>, but the specificity of the abnormality is not yet consistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lower perfusion of rCBF could be seen in frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, AD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo>, and VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It seems that abnormality of the frontal lobe is more common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo>, but temporal lobe abnormalities are more common in AD and VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The perfusion of rCBF in the parietal lobe seems to be related to aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities in the occipital lobe and basal ganglia seem to be more associated with vascular problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thalamic dysfunction was mainly correlated with VD, and that of the cingulate largely with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal abnormalities were associated with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were few reports on changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> disorders and other mental problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is no specific biological marker of SPECT for individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mental disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further study is needed to provide more specific information on the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mental disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It seems that brain abnormalities are similar in Chinese and non Chinese psychiatric patients </plain></SENT>
