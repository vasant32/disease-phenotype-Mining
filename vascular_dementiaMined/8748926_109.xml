<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biochemical markers for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) would be of great value to improve the clinical diagnostic accuracy of the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As abnormally phosphorylated forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau have been consistently found in the brains of AD patients, and since tau can be detected in CSF, two assays based on several well-defined monoclonal tau antibodies were used to study these proteins in CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One assay detects most <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal forms of tau (CSF-tau), while the other is highly specific for phosphorylated tau (CSF-PHFtau) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A marked increase in CSF-PHFtau was found in AD (2230 +/- 930 pg/mL), as compared with controls (640 +/- 230 pg/mL; p &lt; 0.0001), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, VAD (1610 +/- 840 pg/mL; p &lt; 0.05), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000727'>frontal lobe dementia</z:hpo>, FLD (1530 +/- 1000 pg/mL; p &lt; 0.05), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> (720 +/- 590 pg/mL; p &lt; 0.0001), and patients with major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (230 +/- 130 pg/mL; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Parallel results were obtained for CSF-tau </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No less than 35/40 (88%) of AD patients had a CSF-PHFtau value higher than the cutoff level of 1140 pg/mL in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrates that elevated tau/PHFtau levels are consistently found in CSF of AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, a considerable overlap is still present with other forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, both VAD and FLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CSF-tau and CSF-PHFtau may therefore be useful as a positive biochemical marker, to discriminate AD from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aging, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>, and depressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033797" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">pseudodementia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to clarify the sensitivity and specificity of these assays, including follow-up studies with neuropathological examinations </plain></SENT>
