<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is encountered in 60% of both groups, with mild changes in two thirds and moderate or severe changes in one third </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It involves the deep white matter symmetrically, tapering off toward the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by partial loss of myelin, axons, and oligodendroglial cells; mild reactive astrocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo>; and sparsely distributed macrophages as well as stenosis resulting from hyaline <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> of arterioles and smaller vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No complete or cavitating infarctions and no hypertensive vascular changes were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The white matter changes are thought to be due to hypoperfusion of the concerned white matter territories since, in addition to the white matter hyaline <z:mp ids='MP_0005412'>vascular stenosis</z:mp>, these cases show signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, usually with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The white matter disorder also occurs independent of the gray matter process of AD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> and may be seen as the sole brain lesion in non-AD subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Its occurrence is thus neither regularly related to the severity nor to the regional appearance and accentuation of the cortical Alzheimer process and is thus not likely to be just the result of a wallerian degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histologically it is similar in several respects to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e>, although with some distinct differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is thus related to the cerebrovascular group of disorders in addition to AD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In view of its frequency and severity, this white matter lesion is important to define, to diagnose, and ultimately to prevent or cure </plain></SENT>
