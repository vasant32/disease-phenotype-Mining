<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two of the three most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> associated with aging (vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> [VaD] and extrapyramidal [EP]-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) show executive dysfunctions in their clinical presentation; and these <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> are not uncommon in the third one: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine EF tests (yielding 12 measures) were administered to 123 randomly selected community dwellers, aged 81 years and over, with the view to determine the effect of age on performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Markers of AD, VaD, and EP-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, as well as sociodemographic and psychological variables, were selected and their contribution to EF performance was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multiple linear regression analyses revealed the greatest contribution to EF scores from the markers of AD and estimated IQ but not from the markers of VaD and EP-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or from age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that chronological age acts as a proxy variable mediating the impact of other factors such as subclinical signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> and that it has little independent contribution to make </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They also indicate the importance of cognitive abilities supported by posterior cortical circuits in EF problem resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> is not an ineluctable process that is associated with "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" aging but rather represents, in many cases, a byproduct of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e>, albeit themselves highly age-related </plain></SENT>
