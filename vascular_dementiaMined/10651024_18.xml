<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using immunohistochemistry for COX-2, we investigated brains from control subjects and from patients with cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>COX-2 was markedly up-regulated in the neurons and endothelial cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, but was detected sparsely at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stages in these cellular compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, COX-2 immunoreactivity in glial cells was localized to the perinuclear region even in control brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This immunolabeling was more intense and occurred also in the glial cytoplasm in the brains with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Double-labeling immunohistochemistry confirmed that COX-2-immunoreactive glia were mostly microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26347">prostanoid</z:chebi> synthesis is up-regulated in microglia during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and that these cells may be involved in tissue repair or <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-mediated cell responses </plain></SENT>
