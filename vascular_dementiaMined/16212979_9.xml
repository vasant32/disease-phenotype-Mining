<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is a need for empirical studies to define criteria for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (VCI) subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we report the predictive validity of a subtype classification scheme based on clinical and radiographic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine Canadian memory clinics participated in the Consortium to Investigate Vascular Impairment of Cognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This cohort consisted of 1347 patients, of whom 324 had VCI, and was followed for up to 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinical and neuroimaging features defined three subtypes: vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, (n=97), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n=101) and mixed neurodegenerative/vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n=126) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Any ischemic lesion on neuroimaging increased the odds (odds ratio=9.31; 95% confidence interval 6.46, 13.39) of a VCI diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No VCI subtype, however, was associated with a specific neuroimaging abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to those with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, patients with each VCI subtype had higher rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and institutionalization (hazard ratio for combined adverse events=6.08, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both clinical features and radiographic features help establish a diagnosis of VCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The outcomes of VCI subtypes, however, are more strongly associated with clinical features than with radiographic ones </plain></SENT>
