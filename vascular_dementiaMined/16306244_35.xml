<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Participants consisted of 363 aged Japanese-American men from the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results indicated that the correspondence between clinical and neuropathologic diagnosis was not great, with 56% of patients diagnosed with probable or possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> during life but with only 19% having <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>neuritic plaques</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo> as the sole or dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-related lesions in the brain at autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although 16% of cases were attributed to mixed causes during life, almost 40% were found to have significant mixtures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-related lesions at autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> neuropathologic lesions contributed independently to the explanation of variance on a test of overall cognitive performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that clinical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> made during life may fail to reflect the pathogenic complexity of this condition in very elderly persons </plain></SENT>
