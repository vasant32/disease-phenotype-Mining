<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the expression of MMP-9, uPA, and uPAR in post-mortem brains from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and those with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used immunohistochemistry to examine the sections of the parietal lobe and hippocampus from 4 AD and 3 VD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The anti-MMP-9 antibody, anti-uPA antibody, and anti-uPAR antibody were used to perform immunohistological analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the brain tissues from the AD patients, we found expression of MMP-9 in the cytoplasm of neurons, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>senile plaques</z:hpo>, vascular walls and uPAR expression in the cytoplasm of neurons and vascular walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>uPA was detected only in the vascular walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, we could not find expression of MMP-9, uPAR and uPA in the brain tissues of the VD patients, except for the vascular walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The neurons in the AD brains expressed MMP-9 and uPAR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MMP-9 may be produced for the degradation of Abeta, but uPA, which activates MMP-9, was not immunolocalized to the neurons in the AD brains </plain></SENT>
