<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Paeoniflorin (PF), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17793">calycosin</z:chebi>-7-O-β-D-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycoside</z:chebi> (CY), and salvianolic acid B (SB) are marker compounds for extracts of the herbs Paeoniae Radix, Astragali Radix, and Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix, respectively, and are used to assess the quality of mBHT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the pharmacokinetics of these three marker compounds following oral administration of each herb extract alone and in combination as mBHT in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of the three compounds in rat plasma were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, using a C18 column (2.1×150 mm, 5 μm) and mobile phases of <z:chebi fb="43" ids="17790">methanol</z:chebi>-water-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="30751">formic acid</z:chebi> (10:90:0.05, v/v) and <z:chebi fb="43" ids="17790">methanol</z:chebi>-water (90:10, v/v) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that the pharmacokinetic parameters of Paeoniae Radix extract group and mBHT group were very similar, while those of Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix extract group and mBHT group were significantly different (P&lt;0.05, t-test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The T(max), AUC and T(1/2) of SB for Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix extract group were 54.7 min, 598.7 μg min/ml and 37.4 min, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, these values increased to 77.6 min, 915.9 μg min/ml and 53.7 min for mBHT group, supposing that excretion of SB could be more retarded when administered in mBHT than in Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix extract </plain></SENT>
