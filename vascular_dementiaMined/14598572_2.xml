<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The screening and recognition of dementing disorders are considered as important tasks of general practitioners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite of the recent progress made in the treatment of cognitive, behavioral symptoms and slowing down the rate of progression, difficulties are still existing in the early detection, and the most frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> forms such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) are underdiagnosed in Hungary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Any rapid, easy-to-use <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> screening method therefore could be of great value in the community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The Hungarian standardisation of a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> screening tool, the 7 Minute Test (7MT) has been reported here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors provide new data regarding the discriminative power of this test in a variety of dementing and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> related conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The test results of 339 probands, referred to the local memory clinic, were evaluated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subtests, where orientation in time, memory, verbal fluency, and visuoconstructive skills are assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients were clustered into seven groups according to their clinical diagnosis, such as: Control (<z:chebi fb="46" ids="50594">CNT</z:chebi>), Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive Impairment</z:hpo> (MCI), AD, VD, mixed AD-VD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (D) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002625" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Organic Amnestic Syndrome</z:e> (OAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In overall, the test successfully discriminated 77% of the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="50594">CNT</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> disease cases (sensitivity 85%, specificity 55%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When the AD and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="50594">CNT</z:chebi> groups were compared separately, the highest values: 91% sensitivity, 86% specificity have been found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A total score of 139 has been suggested as a cutoff value to separate <z:chebi fb="46" ids="50594">CNT</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the test is suitable to classify <z:chebi fb="46" ids="50594">CNT</z:chebi> and "real" <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases (AD, VD, mixed AD-VD), but not valid within the real <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it is not helpful for the identification of MCI, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033797" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">pseudodementia</z:e> cases (D) and OAS as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The 7MT could be a valuable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> screening tool in the primary care, but it is not specific for any form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
