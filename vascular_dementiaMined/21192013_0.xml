<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to conduct a meta-analysis of epidemiological and case control studies to determine whether arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is specifically associated with an increased risk of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Longitudinal and cross-sectional prospective studies using operationalised criteria to define VaD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control comparison group were systematically reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, and PsycInfo data sources were searched along with reference lists of included articles and reviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Original, prevalence or incidence studies were included if operationalised criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and VaD as well as number of cases with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in VaD and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> groups were provided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intervention studies and post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and CADASIL studies were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven studies recruiting either volunteers or clinical patients, or which were population-based, examined a total of 768 people with VaD and 9857 control cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis of the six longitudinal studies showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was significantly associated with increased risk of incident VaD (odds ratio, OR: 1.59, CI: 1.29-1.95, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A similar association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and the risk of prevalent VaD was found in the five cross-sectional studies (OR: 4.84, CI: 3.52-6.67, p &lt; 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> significantly increases the risk of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The current meta-analysis highlights the potential importance of rigorous treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> as a key measure to help prevent the development of VaD </plain></SENT>
