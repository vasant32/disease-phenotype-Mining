<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have demonstrated that ultra-high resolution MRA imaging using 7 Tessla (T) MRI can be employed to noninvasively visualize the lenticulostriate arteries (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e>) that supply the basal ganglia and internal capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (SVaD) is believed to involve these regions from an early stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e> abnormalities measured by 7T MRA correlate with MRI <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> markers and neuropsychological/motor deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 24 subjects (12 with SVaD, 12 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (NC)) were imaged with 3T and 7T MRIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed the severity of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and the number of lacunes and microbleeds (MB) by visually inspecting images obtained from conventional 3T MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed three-dimensional models of the measured <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSAs</z:e> obtained from 7T MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to the NC, the SVaD subjects had fewer branches of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSAs</z:e> and greater radii of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSAs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of branches was correlated with the number of lacunes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of branches was correlated with the delayed recall scores on Rey's Complex Figure Test (RCFT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While not quite reaching statistical significance, the immediate recall, recognition scores on the RCFT, recognition scores on the Seoul Verbal Learning Test, and the word and color readings of Stroop trended in the direction of correlation with the number of branches, as well as with the extrapyramidal scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e> imaging using 7T MRI might be a potent candidate for the detection of SVaD </plain></SENT>
