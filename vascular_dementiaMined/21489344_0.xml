<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Prospective Research In MEmory clinics (PRIME) is a three-year non-prescriptive, observational study identifying and measuring relationships among predictor and outcome variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients from nine memory clinics, diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI), living in the community with &lt;40 hours/week nursing care were divided into diagnostic groups defined at baseline as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) early or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (FTD), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), mixed (AD and VaD) and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To achieve outcome measures, baseline and change over six months in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measures by diagnostic group, and predictors of change at six months were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 970 patients enrolled, 967 were eligible for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common disorder was AD (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo>) accounting for 46.5% of this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients had an overall slight worsening on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> assessment scales over the six-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with FTD had a more marked change (decline) in cognition, function and behavior over six months compared to other diagnostic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in the regression analysis the difference was not significant between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Predictors of decline in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were not robust at six months, and longer follow-up is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with FTD were more likely to be prescribed psychotropics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The PRIME study is continuing and will provide important data on predictors of decline along with differences between diagnosis groups on the rate of change </plain></SENT>
