<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: While vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) is the second most prevalent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnosis, little is known about healthcare use and costs for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study compares the healthcare use and costs of community-dwelling patients with VaD to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> (OD), cerebrovascular disease without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>), and patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or cerebrovascular disease (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using diagnoses codes from medical claims and encounter records, 678 VaD, 1,722 AD, 957 OD, 2,718 CVD, and 14,023 controls were identified from patients enrolled in a 100,000-member group practice Medicare HMO during 1999-2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Annual healthcare use and costs of the study groups were compared, using regression analysis to control for patient characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VaD patients had the highest annual costs, dollars 14,387, followed by dollars 10,716 for OD, dollars 8,254 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, and dollars 7,839 for AD, and dollars 5,494 for controls (p&lt;0.0001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons to VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite higher total direct costs, VaD patients had lower costs for physician visits and prescription drugs compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> study groups except OD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> patients had the highest costs for these services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, hospital admissions for VaD were nearly twice those for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, and hospital days for VaD nearly three times those for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, despite the high prevalence of cardiovascular conditions for both VaD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: VaD patients had higher healthcare costs compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The substantially higher costs for VaD compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and the differences in use of healthcare services by VaD compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, not cerebrovascular disease, is a major source of the cost differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lower costs for physician visits and prescription drugs for VaD suggest possible opportunities for improving ambulatory care and preventing high-cost hospitalizations </plain></SENT>
