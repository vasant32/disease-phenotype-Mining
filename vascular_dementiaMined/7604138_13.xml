<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six were subdiagnosed as senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer type (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e>), 56 as multiinfarct <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MID), based on computed tomography and Hachinski scores (&lt; or = 49 SDAT, &gt; or = 7 MID) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They received, after 2 weeks' run-in period (placebo), randomized for 8 weeks either 2 x 30 mg nicergoline (NIC) or 2 x 1 placebo (PLAC) orally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The four subgroups (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e>/NIC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e>/PLAC, MID/NIC, MID/PLAC; 4 x 28 patients) were comparable in regard to age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only four, four, four and two patients of the respective groups did not finish the study for minor reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Confirmatory statistical analysis demonstrated in the target variable-the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-a significant superiority of Global Impression (CGI)-a significant superiority of NIC over PLAC in both the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> and MID groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Global improvement (CGI item 2) was seen in both nicergoline subgroups (3 and 3), while no changes occurred under placebo (4 and 4, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The responder versus non-responder ratio was in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e>/NIC group 16/8, versus 8/16 in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e>/PLAC group (chi 2 = 4.1, P = 0.04); in the MID/NIC group 17/7, versus 7/19 in the MID/PLAC group (chi 2 = 7.96, P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was a significant improvement of the Mini-Mental State and the SCAG score in both the MID and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> group after 8 weeks of nicergoline, which was significantly superior to the minimal improvement or no change in placebo-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> and MID patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>EEG mapping demonstrated in NIC-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> and MID patients a significant decrease in delta and theta, increase in alpha 2 and beta activity and an acceleration of the centroid of the total power spectrum as compared with pretreatment, while opposite changes occurred in PLAC-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> and MID patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The differences between PLAC and NIC reached the level of statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Event-related potential (ERP) recordings demonstrated a significantly shortened P300 latency under NIC treatment in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> and MID patients, while there was a trend towards lengthening under PLAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, nicergoline improved vigilance and information processing at the neurophysiological level, which leads at the behavioural level to clinical improvement both in degenerative and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
