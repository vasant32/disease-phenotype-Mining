<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>Cerebral atrophy</z:hpo>, detected as ventricular enlargement or sulcal widening on MRI, is recognized as a risk factor for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its underlying pathophysiology is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined whether <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> microvascular assessment could provide predictive information on the risk of ventricular enlargement and sulcal widening on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective, population-based study was conducted of 810 middle-aged persons without clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or MRI <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants had a first cranial MRI and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> photography in 1993 to 1995 and returned for a repeated MRI in 2004 to 2006 (median follow-up of 10.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> photographs were graded for presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> microvascular abnormalities, and MRI images were graded for ventricular size and sulcal size according to standardized protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ventricular enlargement and sulcal widening were defined as an increase in ventricular size or sulcal size of &gt;or=3 of 10 grades between baseline and follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjusting for age, gender, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and arteriovenous nicking at baseline were associated with 10-year ventricular enlargement (OR and 95% CI: 2.03, 1.20 to 4.42 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and 2.19, 1.23 to 3.90 for arteriovenous nicking) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> signs were not associated with 10-year sulcal widening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> and arteriovenous nicking are predictive of long-term risk of ventricular enlargement, but not of sulcal widening, independent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data support a microvascular etiology for subcortical but not cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
