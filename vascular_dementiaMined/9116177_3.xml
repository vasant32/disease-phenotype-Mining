<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of the HIS and two modified versions in the diagnosis of AD, IVD, and single <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in a large, geriatric population with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (N = 100) was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity for identification of AD was greater than 90% but was less than 70% for IVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over one third of patients with one or more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on computed tomographic brain scans and 63% of mixed cases were classified as having probable AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that ischemic scores may be useful at predicting prevalence rates if individual case accuracy is ignored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite being sensitive to identifying AD, ischemic scores are insensitive to both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and IVD and cannot reliably exclude IVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, patients with mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> should not be expected to have intermediate scores </plain></SENT>
