<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively studied 65 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 37 met the criteria of NINCDS-ADRDA for probable AD and 28 the clinical and radiological criteria of NINDS-AIREN for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among VaD patients, 22 met the radiological criteria for subcortical VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Minimental State Examination (MMSE) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) were used to evaluate cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent a neuroimaging study (CT scan and/or MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were not treated with antidementia or <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35471">psychotropic drugs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age, gender, educational level and MMSE scores did not differ between patients (p &gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The total prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms was similar in both groups (AD 94.6% vs. VaD 96.4%, p= 0.727) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>Sleep disturbances</z:hpo> (35.1% v 3.6%, p =0.002) and appetite changes (37.8% v 14.3%, p = 0.032) were more prevalent in AD patients than in VaD patients who met the NINDS-AIREN criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>Sleep disturbances</z:hpo> (35.1% v 4.5%, p =0.008), appetite changes (37.8% v 13.6%, p = 0.047) and aberrant motor behaviour (24.3% v 0%, p =0.012) were more prevalent in AD patients than in subcortical VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The total scores for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbance</z:hpo>, appetite changes and aberrant motor behavioural were higher in AD patients (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences between AD and VaD patients, except that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbances</z:hpo>, appetite changes and aberrant motor behaviour that were more prevalent and severe in AD </plain></SENT>
