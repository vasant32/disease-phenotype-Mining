<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prevalence survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Community and institutional settings in Canada, excluding those in the two territories, Indian reserves and military units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Representative sample of people aged 65 and over interviewed between February 1991 and May 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those in the community (9008 subjects) were chosen randomly from medicare lists in nine provinces or from the Enumeration Composite Record in Ontario </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>People in institutions (1255) were randomly selected from residents in stratified random samples of institutions in each region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Screening with the Modified Mini-Mental State (3MS) Examination to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical examination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> those in institutions, those in the community with a 3MS score of less than 78 and a sample of those in the community with a 3MS score of 78 or more to diagnose <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> were defined according to established criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types, by region, sex and age group, the estimated number of cases in the population by type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and the age-standardized rate per 1000 population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence estimates suggested that 252,600 (8.0%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Canadians aged 65 and over met the criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (95% confidence interval [CI] 236,800 to 268,400) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These were divided roughly equally between the community and institutional samples; the female:male ratio was 2:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The age-standardized rate ranged from 2.4%, among those aged 65 to 74 years, to 34.5%, among those aged 85 and over </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The corresponding figures for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> were 5.1% overall (161,000 cases; 95% CI 148,100 to 173,900), ranging from 1.0% to 26.0%; for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> it was 1.5% overall, ranging from 0.6% to 4.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>If the prevalence estimates remain constant, the number of Canadians with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> will rise to 592,000 by 2021 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These Canadian estimates of the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> fall toward the upper end of the ranges in other studies, whereas the estimates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> fall in the middle of the ranges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This may suggest an unusual balance between Alzheimer's and other forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the Canadian population </plain></SENT>
