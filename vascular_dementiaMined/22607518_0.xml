<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Background:  There have been some reports of a relationship between disease symptoms and oral status in the elderly with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, but few reports have been conducted in the elderly with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Until now, the relationship between BPSD and oral status has been unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Materials and methods:  An investigation was conducted concerning BPSD and oral status among 57 subjects with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (mean age, 85.7 ± 5.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The wearing of dentures and oral activities of daily living (oral ADL) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results:  Subjects with activity disturbances and those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> had significantly lower rates of denture wearing than those without these two symptoms (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significantly lower oral ADL scores were obtained from subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011253" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">delusional ideas</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000738'>hallucinations</z:hpo>, activity disturbances and diurnal rhythm disturbances (p &lt; 0.05), as well as those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0525045" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">affective disturbances</z:e> (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusion:  This study indicated a relationship between BPSD and the wearing of dentures in the elderly with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study also demonstrated relationships between BPSD and oral ADL </plain></SENT>
