<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the efficacy of memory, confrontational naming, visuoconstructional ability, processing speed, and executive functioning in differentiating AD from VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Delayed verbal memory, visuoconstructional ability, and confrontational naming as measured by WMS-R Logical Memory II, WAIS-R Block Design (BD), and Boston Naming Test, respectively, were most effective in discriminating between these two disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results indicated AD was best classified by BD, and BD was the most sensitive to AD-related pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Delayed memory and confrontational naming were highly implicated in each subtype, suggesting they are sensitive to each disease process, thus reducing the reliability of utilizing them as sole differentiating agents </plain></SENT>
