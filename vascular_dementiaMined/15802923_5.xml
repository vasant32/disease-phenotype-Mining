<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the influence of different diagnostic criteria on the prevalence and cumulative incidence of VaD in first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (n = 194) clinically evaluated at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> VaD was diagnosed using the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10-NA, NINDS-AIREN, and ADDTC criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was highest at 1 month; ranging from 11.3% with the NINDS-AIREN to 20.1% with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10-NA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence was highest at 6 months, ranging from 2.6% with the ADDTC to 5.2% with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10-NA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Agreement among diagnostic criteria was high, with the exception of the ADDTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, both the prevalence and incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are highest directly after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but exact rates are influenced by the diagnostic criteria used </plain></SENT>
