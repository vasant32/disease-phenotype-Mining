<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study endeavored to differentiate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) from vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) by comparing the metabolic and hemodynamic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">Positron</z:chebi> emission tomographic (PET) studies were carried out in 13 patients with probable AD and 20 patients with VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PET findings were not included in the diagnostic criteria of AD or VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36932">oxygen-15</z:chebi> labeled compounds, cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), cerebral blood volume, and vascular transit time (VTT) were measured quantitatively during the resting state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To evaluate vascular reactivity (VR), CBF was also measured during 7% <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> inhalation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regional CBF from the parietal cortex positively correlated with the neuropsychological scores in both AD and VaD groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The typical parietotemporal pattern of hypoperfusion and hypometabolism was observed in the AD group, whereas the frontal lobe including the cingulate and superior frontal gyri were predominantly affected in the VaD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The occipital cortex was preserved in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant increase of the OEF was found in the parietotemporal areas in the AD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant prolongation was seen with VTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a marked difference in VR between the two groups: VR was depleted in the VaD group, whereas VR was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the AD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The increased OEF with preserved vascular reserve seen in AD may implicate participation of a vascular factor in the pathogenesis of AD, possibly at the capillary level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, PET provides important functional information in discriminating AD from VaD by comparing the patterns of hypoperfusion and/or hypometabolism, and in the understanding of the underlying hemodynamic pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
