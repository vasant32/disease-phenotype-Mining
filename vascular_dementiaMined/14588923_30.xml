<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a previous article we described a 10-point scoring system (i.e., scale 1) to grade clock drawings to command and copy with hands set for "ten after 11" among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alzheimer's subjects (AD) improved from the command to copy conditions, whereas subjects with ischaemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (IVD) did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> responsible for this profile, an additional scale was developed (scale 2) that tallied errors in graphomotor functioning, hand/number placement, and executive control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On an independent sample of subjects, AD subjects, again, made significant improvement on scale 1 from the command to copy condition, whereas no such improvement occurred among the IVD subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On scale 2, IVD subjects made more graphomotor errors in the command condition, and more executive control and more total errors in the copy conditions than AD subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A number of positive correlations were noted between tests of language and memory on scale 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, scores on tests of executive control declined as scale 2 errors increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, a principal component analysis indicated that scale 2 test performance loaded on a factor with other tests related to executive control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that impairment in frontal systems functioning may explain why IVD subjects do not improve from the command to copy conditions on scale 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such a pattern of performance in clock drawing may also be helpful in making a differential diagnosis between AD and IVD </plain></SENT>
