<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results indicated (a) no group differences in those variables reflecting primary memory, and clear <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-related deficits in secondary memory; (b) no differences between persons with AD and VaD in face recognition and object recall, and (c) an advantage of VaD patients compared with AD patients in word recall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was suggested that the ability to transfer information from temporary to permanent storage may be particularly affected by a dementing disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the selective AD-related deficit in word recall was interpreted in terms of a greater impairment of various language-related skills in AD compared with VaD </plain></SENT>
