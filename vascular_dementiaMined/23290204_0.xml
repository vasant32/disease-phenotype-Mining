<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, no data were reported regarding a role of SLC6A4 in late-life <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to explore the possible involvement of the SLC6A4 locus in patients with late-life <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e> by means of a haplotype-tagged approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Older patients attending a geriatric unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: A total of 218 patients with late-life <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e> (61 men and 157 women) age 65 to 92 years (76.29 ± 6.53 years) and 363 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>-free healthy subjects (156 men and 207 women) age 41 to 65 years (48.33 ± 5.94 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Genotyping and haplotype estimation of the three markers rs4795541, rs140701, and rs3813034 spanning a 39-kb block the SLC6A4 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses of late-life <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e>, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and other dementing diseases were made using current clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in allele or genotype distribution for the three SLC6A4 markers across the study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because the comparison group could not be matched for age, a sensitivity analysis for the misclassification of controls was performed according to different scenarios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For each simulated scenario, the same nonsignificant result was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the results are limited to late-life <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e> that is specifically not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, and there was limited power for detecting very small effect sizes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that the SLC6A4 locus play a minor role, if any, in the pathogenesis of late-life <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Also, tempering our conclusions, we were unable to account for population stratification, recurrence or chronicity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, nor the influence of coexisting medical, cognitive, and psychosocial stressors </plain></SENT>
