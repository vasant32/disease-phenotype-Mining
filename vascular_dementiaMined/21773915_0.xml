<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This chapter will provide an overview of vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and age-related cerebrovascular disorders and diseases, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cognitive and functional sequellae of these cerebrovascular disorders will also be described in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Throughout this review, we will emphasize topics that have been relatively underrepresented in the literature, including age-related diseases of the cerebral small vessels, nuanced characterization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> associated with insidious small-vessel vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and the real-life functional consequences of cerebrovascular changes in older adults </plain></SENT>
