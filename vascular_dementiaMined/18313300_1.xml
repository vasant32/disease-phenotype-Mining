<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ubiquitin is a highly conserved protein involved in many important cellular processes, such as cell surface receptor signaling, endocytosis and protein degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since ubiquitin plays a key role in the pathomechanisms of many <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo>, we immunohistochemically analyzed its expression in cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> with subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> (CADASIL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CADASIL is a heritable vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> characterized by degeneration of the vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) caused by mutations in the notch 3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In CADASIL, there is abnormal accumulation of the Notch 3 extracellular domain on blood vessels, but the molecular pathways linking notch 3 mutations to degeneration of the VSMC are, as yet, poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied human brain and skin biopsy specimens, and observed increased ubiquitin expression on structures primarily affected by the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath> in CADASIL: the VSMC and vascular lamina media, and also large ballooned macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructurally, we noted that pathognomonic CADASIL deposits of granular osmiophilic material were often located inside indentations in the VSMC membrane that resembled endocytic vesicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suggest that in CADASIL, damage to the VSMC may be associated with aberrant ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis of the Notch 3 ligand, and increased accumulation of ubiquitin on the vessel wall may be a manifestation of this aberration </plain></SENT>
