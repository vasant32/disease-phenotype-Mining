<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the gene encoding the cell surface receptor, Notch3, have been identified in CADASIL patients, and accumulation of the extracellular domain of Notch3 has been demonstrated in affected vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CADASIL mutations alter the number of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32460">cysteine residues</z:chebi> in the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats in the extracellular domain of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To understand the functional consequences of a recurrent CADASIL mutation on furin processing, cell surface expression, ligand binding, and activation of a downstream effector CBF1 by the Notch3 receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We expressed <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> and mutant Notch3 receptors in cultured cells and examined cell surface expression of the proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also applied a new flow cytometry based approach to semi-quantitatively measure binding to three Notch ligands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we used a well characterised co-culture system to examine ligand dependent activation of transcription from a CBF1-luciferase reporter construct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: These studies revealed subtle abnormalities in furin processing of the mutant receptor, although both heterodimeric and full length receptors are present on the cell surface, are capable of interacting with soluble forms of three ligands, Delta1, Delta4, and Jagged1, and retain the ability to activate CBF1 in a ligand dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: By comparison with other mutant forms of Notch3, these data indicate that individual CADASIL mutations can have disparate effects on Notch3 expression and function </plain></SENT>
