<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to retrospectively assess the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and its cognitive impact in patients with AD in everyday clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical notes were retrospectively reviewed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals who presented at East Sussex Memory Clinic (2004-2008) for investigation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and had brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as part of their clinical work-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Global cognitive status was assessed with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Cambridge Cognitive Examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The extent of cerebrovascular abnormalities was qualitatively evaluated with MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Notes were reviewed for 232 patients (109 males, 123 females), mean age 76 years (range 62-93), who underwent MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 167 (72%) patients were diagnosed with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> was present in 89% of AD patients and 47% of patients had moderate to severe cerebrovascular abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients (57%) had MMSE scores in the 21-26 range, indicative of mild AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a trend towards worse cognitive status in patients with more severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, which did not reach significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hachinski Ischaemic score indicated these patients did not have vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) (mean +/- standard deviation 1.1 +/- 1.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings, based on qualitative MRI, indicate that cerebrovascular pathology is a very common associated feature in patients with mild to moderate AD, without VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although the study suggests that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> does not contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>, and is not associated with the development of VaD, a non-significant trend was observed towards worsening cognitive status with increasing severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The finding of this trend suggests a need for additional research, especially a prospective quantitative method of assessing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, to improve our understanding of how <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> contributes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in AD </plain></SENT>
