<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: From participants in a nationwide, multicenter, hospital-based cohort study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> by the Clinical Research Center for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> of South Korea (November 2005 to December 2011), data for 5,077 elderly subjects (mean [SD] age = 71.37 [8.40] years) who had available data for APOE genotype and WMH severity were studied retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used the diagnostic criteria for mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> proposed by Petersen et al; the diagnostic criteria for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> included in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV; and, for probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, the criteria issued by the National Institute of Neurological and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009460" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Communicative Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> and Related Disorders Association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>WMH severity was evaluated using modified criteria of Fazekas et al and Scheltens et al using T2 axial or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance images, yielding 3 groups for WMH severity level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>APOE genotype was determined by analysis of venous blood, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants were classified into 2 groups depending on presence or absence of the APOE ε4 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Version was used for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, classified by 6 cognitive test scores, was the primary outcome measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using multiple logistic regression, we investigated which cognitive domains were associated with WMH severity and the APOE ε4 allele, and, using analysis of covariance, we examined the interaction effects of these 2 factors on cognitive test scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After multivariable adjustments, logistic regression analyses showed that WMH severity was associated with higher odds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> on frontal/executive function tests in both APOE ε4 carriers (odds ratio [OR] = 2.49; 95% CI, 1.65-3.76) and noncarriers (OR = 2.36; 95% CI, 1.83-3.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>WMH severity was not significantly associated with memory function in APOE ε4 carriers: for verbal memory, ε4 noncarriers had an OR of 1.44 (95% CI, 1.13-1.84), and ε4 carriers had an OR of 1.36 (95% CI, 0.87-2.04); for visuospatial memory, ε4 noncarriers had an OR of 1.86 (95% CI, 1.45-2.37), and ε4 carriers had an OR of 1.35 (95% CI, 0.89-2.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a significant interaction effect between APOE ε4 and WMH severity was confirmed on memory tests by analysis of covariance (verbal memory: F = 3.40, P = .033; visuospatial memory: F = 8.49, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Severe WMHs appear to be predominantly associated with frontal/executive dysfunction, irrespective of APOE ε4 allele presence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>WMH severity and APOE ε4 had an interactive effect on memory function, with WMH severity affecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> only in APOE ε4 noncarriers </plain></SENT>
