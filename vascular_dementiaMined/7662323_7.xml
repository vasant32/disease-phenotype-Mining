<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A negative correlation between CSF levels of alpha 1-ACT and the stage of the disease was present in patients with both e-AD and l-AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No difference in alpha 2-macroglobulin levels in CSF and serum from patients with e-AD, l-AD, VD, and nondemented controls was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum concentrations of alpha 1-antitrypsin from l-AD subjects were within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, increased levels of alpha 1-ACT in CSF and serum were specifically associated with AD, and the detection of this serpin in CSF may be useful in monitoring the progression of the disease </plain></SENT>
