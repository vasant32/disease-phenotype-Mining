<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation was established in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, repetitive administrations (20 mg/kg, IP, four administrations/12 h) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17963">1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine</z:chebi> (MPTP) nullified the positive correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A similar phenomenon was induced by ICV-administered MPTP (18 and 36 micrograms) in the animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15765">L-dopa</z:chebi> administration (50 mg/kg, IV) in MPTP-treated (1 week after the final IP administration of MPTP) mice reversed the tendency of MPTP, although the agent alone did not affect the positive correlation in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that nullification of the positive correlation probably was induced by the central effects of MPTP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have found previously that the lack of a positive correlation between urinary levels of alpha 1M and UT distinguishes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> from other neuropsychiatric diseases such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (Alzheimer-type and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0525045" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mood disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our present results displayed a phenomenon that the lack of correlation between urinary levels of alpha 1M and UT in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> is reproducible in MPTP-treated mice </plain></SENT>
