<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>150 patients diagnosed at the Chungnam National University Hospital (87 women and 63 men) memory clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The participants consisted of 68 patients with AD, 23 patients with VaD, and 59 patients with PDD, who were diagnosed by the individual criteria, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cognitive screening was evaluated using the Korean version of the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Repeated evaluations were conducted at 6-month, 1 year, and 2 years after initial baseline assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> were calculated by dividing MMSE score differences by the number of months lapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No difference was found between the three <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtypes with respect to baseline MMSE scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>Cognitive decline</z:hpo> was not obvious up to 6-month of the follow-up, but by 12-month of follow-ups was significant regardless of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in the AD group was significantly faster than in the PDD or VaD groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is not linear over time and that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtypes have different rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e> </plain></SENT>
