<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To compare the performances of two matched groups of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) on a battery of neuropsychological tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 325 patients attending a memory clinic were given a detailed multi-disciplinary diagnostic assessment, including a battery of neuropsychological tests administered by a psychologist and a speech and language therapist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The performances of two groups of patients meeting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10 criteria for AD (n = 103) and VaD (n = 68) were compared, adjusting for age, gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity and pre-morbid IQ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with co-morbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and mixed AD+VaD were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment, the AD and VaD groups differed significantly on the Graded Naming Test (VaD superior), AMIPB Complex Design immediate and delayed recall (VaD superior), the Trail Making Test error score (Part B) (VaD superior), and Verbal Picture Description (VaD superior) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings support previous evidence that language function and non-verbal memory are selectively more impaired in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The better performance by VaD patients on the Trail Making Test (B) runs counter to previous suggestions that there is an excess of frontal executive dysfunction in this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It may be that this test is more sensitive to the early impairment of concurrent manipulation of information in AD </plain></SENT>
