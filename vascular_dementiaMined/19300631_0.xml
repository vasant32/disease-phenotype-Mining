<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty subjects were randomized to either placebo (n = 20) or rivastigmine (n = 20) in a double-blind 26-week trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures were cognition (mini-mental state examination, frontal assessment battery), neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI), instrumental activities of daily living, clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rating scale, and adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No statistical significant benefit could be observed in the active group in any of the efficacy measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A trend favoring active group was observed only in the NPI subscore of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo> (p = 0.066) and aberrant motor behavior (p = 0.068) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Withdrawal rate was 30% and 15% in the active and placebo group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Among Chinese subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients, there was no apparent cognitive benefit associated with use of rivastigmine over the 6 months period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A trend favoring rivastigmine was observed in certain behavioral measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rivastigmine was associated with more withdrawals relative to placebo </plain></SENT>
