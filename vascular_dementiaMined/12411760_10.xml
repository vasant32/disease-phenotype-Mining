<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The two most frequently examined biomarkers in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau and beta-amyloid(1-42) (Abeta(1-42)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An assay for tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (phospho-tau) has recently been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied these three markers in patients with possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD; n = 23), probable AD (n = 50), AD with relevant cerebrovascular disease (AD with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>; n = 14), possible vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD; n = 39), probable VaD (n = 36), cognitively impaired (n = 13) and 27 neurologically healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with the controls, tau levels were significantly increased in possible AD, probable AD, AD with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and probable VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abeta(1-42) was decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups compared with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, phospho-tau levels were increased only in probable AD compared with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From the results of the present study, it is concluded that neither measurement of phospho-tau, tau nor Abeta(1-42) in CSF can discriminate entirely between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and cognitively non-disturbed controls or between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of different aetiologies in the clinical diagnostic procedure </plain></SENT>
