<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Body height is affected by childhood conditions that promote growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors examine the relationship of height in midlife and subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD), and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was evaluated from 1999 to 2001 in 1,892 men age 76 to 95 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Height had been measured when these men participated in the Israeli <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">Ischemic Heart Disease</z:e> project in 1963 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age, socioeconomic status (SES), and area of birth were also assessed in 1963 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Older men and those with lower SES tended to be shorter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relative to the shortest quartile, controlling for age, SES, and area of birth, the other quartiles had lesser respective odds ratios for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> as a whole, AD, and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Height was inversely associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, AD, and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in a male sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since height is associated with childhood nutrition and may be associated with other risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, efforts to improve early life conditions that maximize body growth may diminish or delay the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in later life </plain></SENT>
