<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with its underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> pathology, is a challenge for clinicians, and is frequently further aggravated by overlap with other neurodegenerative processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Current <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> drugs have had limited clinical efficacy in treating vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and none have been approved by major regulatory authorities specifically for this disease </plain></SENT>
