<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> groups were comparable in age, years of education, gender distribution, and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The selection of cognitive tasks (letter and category fluency, Block design, Clock reading and setting, and episodic face recognition) was thought to address some of the inconsistencies in previous research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main finding was that AD and AD patients were comparable on most tasks, although robust <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-related deficiencies were found when comparing the results of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> participants with those of the control participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that AD and AD may affect several basic cognitive functions in an equal manner </plain></SENT>
