<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These were quantitated in 100 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 23 <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> patients and 59 control subjects selected from 590 consecutive scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rims, caps, and ventricular size were rated on a scale from 0 to 3 for severity, and the UBOs were counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that the rim is also frequent in control subjects and increases with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unidentified bright objects, caps, and severe rims usually signify pathology, occurring much more frequently in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> is a significant risk factor in UBOs and caps, but in rims, the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical and pathologic significance of these hyperintensities and their relationship to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e>, lacunar state, and "état criblé" is discussed </plain></SENT>
