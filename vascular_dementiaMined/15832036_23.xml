<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There are conflicting reports about the potential role of vitamin <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> in preventing and/or slowing the progression of various forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined longitudinal data from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging, a population-based, prospective 5-year investigation of the epidemiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> among Canadians aged 65+ years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our primary objective was to examine the association between supplemental use of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> vitamins and subsequent risk of significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> (decrease in 3MS score of 10 points or more) among subjects with no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at baseline (n=894) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also explored the relationship between vitamin supplement use and incident vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (VCI; including a diagnosis of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, possible AD with vascular components and VCI but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases) and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for potential confounding factors assessed at baseline, subjects reporting a combined use of vitamin E and C supplements and/or multivitamin consumption at baseline were significantly less likely (adjusted OR 0.51; 95% CI 0.29-0.90) to experience significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> during a 5-year follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects reporting any <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> vitamin use at baseline also showed a significantly lower risk for incident VCI (adjusted OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13-0.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A reduced risk for incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or AD was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest a possible protective effect for <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> vitamins in relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> but randomized controlled trials are required for confirmation </plain></SENT>
