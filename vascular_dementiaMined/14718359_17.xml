<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A large genetic contribution to this late-life form of target organ damage was suggested by a study of elderly male twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As part of the Genetic Epidemiology Network of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Arteriopathy</z:e> (GENOA), 483 non-Hispanic white subjects were recruited to undergo MRI for determination of the brain volume of leukoaraiosis (291 women and 192 men from 210 sibships providing 434 sibling pairs; mean age+/-SD=65.2+/-7.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The GENOA-Rochester sibships contain 2 or more siblings with essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> diagnosed before age 60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency distribution of the volume of leukoaraiosis was positively skewed, with a median value of 6.61 cm3 (interquartile range: 4.77 to 9 0.83 cm3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Variance component models were used to estimate the heritability (ie, the proportion of phenotypic variation caused by additive genetic factors) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After logarithm transformation of the volume of leukoaraiosis, the estimated heritability (+/-SE) was 0.802+/-0.102 (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adjustments for sex, age, systolic blood pressure, and brain volume reduced the heritability estimate to 0.671+/-0.110 (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This evidence of strong genetic influence on the susceptibility to leukoaraiosis justifies efforts to localize the responsible genes and characterize the predisposing genetic polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
