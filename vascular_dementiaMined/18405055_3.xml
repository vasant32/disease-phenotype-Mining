<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They remain difficult to differentiate in practice because of lack of sensitivity and specificity of current clinical diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent molecular and cellular advancements indicate that the use of cerebrospinal fluid markers may improve early detection and differential diagnosis of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our objective in this study was to determine diagnostic accuracy of three cerebrospinal (CSF) markers: total tau protein (t-tau), tau protein phosphorylated on threonine 181 (p-tau181) and tau protein phosphorylated on serine 199 (p-tau199) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using commercially available ELISA kits concentrations of t-tau, p-tau181 and p-tau199 were analyzed in 12 patients with probable AD, 9 patients with VaD and 12 NC subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three markers were significantly higher in AD group versus VaD and NC groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, when the sensitivity levels were set to 85% or higher, only t-tau and p-tau199 satisfied consensus recommendations (specificity more than 75%) when differentiating AD from VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our preliminary data on a small group of selected subjects suggest that the CSF t-tau and p-tau199 levels are useful markers for differentiating AD from VaD </plain></SENT>
