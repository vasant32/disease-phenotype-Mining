<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Many epidemiologic studies have considered whether markers of B-vitamin status are associated with cognitive function and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This avenue of research was sparked by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi>) theory of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, which was extended to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> when a link between vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> was discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> could cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> via direct neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, decreased remethylation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> to methionine might also compromise cognitive function by means other than mere <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> lowering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">Folate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B-12</z:chebi> participate in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> remethylation and largely determine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consequently, much of the relevant research has focused on these 2 B vitamins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The many subtly different hypotheses that investigators have addressed by attempting to link several B-vitamin status indicators to diverse cognition-related outcomes have created a confusing body of conflicting studies that seems to defy summarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, themes are discernible that aid interpretation, foster hypothesis generation, and inform future study design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For example, despite a shared metabolic pathway, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B-12</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> are differently related to specific cognitive outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although consistency of findings across studies is often touted as essential to distinguishing causal from coincidental relationships, discrepancies among study findings can be even more informative </plain></SENT>
