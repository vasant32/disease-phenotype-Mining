<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initial studies of galantamine demonstrated cognitive, behavioral, and functional benefits in these populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>326 patients with VaD or AD with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> who completed an initial 12-month trial were treated with galantamine 24 mg/day in a 24-month, open-label extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This interim analysis was performed at month 12 of the open-label extension (248 completed the trial) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Galantamine (up to 24 months total) was well tolerated in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most frequently reported adverse events, characteristic of older <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients, included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
