<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (HS) is a common and often asymmetric neuropathological finding among elderly persons who experience progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory loss</z:hpo>, but its cause is unknown and it is rarely diagnosed during life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to improve both understanding and diagnosis of late-life HS, bilateral hippocampi and cerebral hemispheres were reviewed in 130 consecutive autopsy cases drawn from a longitudinal study of subjects with subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (IVD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HS was found in 31 of 130 cases (24.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 45% were bilateral, 32% left-sided, and 23% right-sided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of HS cases involved the entire rostral-caudal extent of the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in 7 cases HS was focal in nature and was only found at or anterior to the lateral geniculate nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 77% of cases, HS was accompanied by other types of pathology ('mixed' HS), but in 23% of cases it was the sole neuropathologic finding ('pure' HS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TDP-43-positive cytoplasmic inclusions were found in dentate granule cells in 93% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> HS cases, 55% of AD cases with no HS, but 0% of IVD cases with no HS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MRI hippocampal volumes were significantly lower in bilateral HS compared to AD (p &lt; 0.001) and in unilateral HS cases compared to cases with intact hippocampi (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since HS may occur unilaterally in approximately a quarter of cases, its prevalence may be underestimated if only one cerebral hemisphere is examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presence of TDP-43 inclusions in HS cases, regardless of accompanying pathologies (e.g., AD, IVD, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FTLD</z:e>), is consistent with an underlying neurodegenerative pathogenetic mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies are warranted to determine whether greater severity of hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> on MRI may assist the clinical differentiation of HS from AD </plain></SENT>
