<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, presence of cerebrovascular disease may intensify the clinical symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of vascular risk factors in age and sex matched patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied 109 patients with AD and 37 patients vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in AD and VD was 65.8 SD 7.8 and 67.4 SD 7.0 years (p &gt; 0.05), the duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> and GDS for patients with AD and VD was not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was associated in 51.3% VD and 30.3% AD (p &lt; 0.05), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> in 11.1 and 23.6% respectively (p &gt; 0.05), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was similar in AD and VD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> was presents 64.8% AD and 46.8 VD (p &gt; 0.05) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 21.6% and 10.1% (p &gt; 0.05) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile were found in both groups, except two times higher incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> concentration in AD compare to VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relation between alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking and head trauma was similar in both types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Vascular disease</z:e> and AD have to some extent a shared aetiology, and risk factors that they have in common increase the risk of both disorders independently and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> is perhaps involved in the aetiology of AD </plain></SENT>
