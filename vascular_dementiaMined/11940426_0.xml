<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To develop a model that assists in the classification of patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in two of its most relevant subtypes: multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (cortical involvement) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> (subcortical involvement) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 50 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> and 50 patients with multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> studied throughout a 12-year period (1986-1998) in a tertiary university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The statistical model was obtained by multivariant analysis (logit model) and its accuracy was estimated by means of ROC curve analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The variables included in the regression model were: arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.03), cardioembolic disease (p &lt; 0.05), and presence of cortical (p &lt; 0.01) and lacunar (p &lt; 0.01) infarctions in CAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The specificity of the model was 90%, the sensitivity near 60%, and the positive likelihood ratio 5.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The area under the ROC curve was 0.80 (0.73-0.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite the availability of consensus diagnostic criteria for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, their use is very commonly restricted to the research field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have developed a classification model for patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in two relevant subgroups: multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This model can contribute to make identification of these patients in the daily clinical practice easier </plain></SENT>
