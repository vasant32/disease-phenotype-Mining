<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medication on risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim was to investigate the association between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> prescriptions and incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, using a primary care database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The analysis was based on 575 general and internal practices in Germany (10/2003 - 09/2008) (Disease analyzer database) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">Antihypertensive</z:chebi> medication (ATC codes) during 3 years before newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> codes or specific medication) in 1,297 patients was compared to 1,297 controls without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> after matching for age (mean age: 80.6 ± 8.6 y), sex (females: 62%) and date of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate crude and adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Betablocker prescriptions (≥ 1 per year over 3 y) showed a significant inverse association with newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (Odds ratio, OR: 0.79 95% CI 0.61 - 0.99) after adjusting for demographic covariates, health care use, and cardiovascular and neurological comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the fully adjusted model, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi> also tended to be inversely associated with incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, but failed statistical significance (OR 0.84 95% CI 0.65 - 1.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">Calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> were positively related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> only in the crude analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The other drug groups were not significantly related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> OR: 0.89; 0.67 - 1.19; angiotensin- 1-inhibitors OR: 1.04; 0.66 - 1.64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This practice-based case-control study indicated a possible protective effect of some <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive agents</z:chebi> (betablockers, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE-inhibitors</z:chebi>) on the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Randomized controlled trials are required to confirm this finding </plain></SENT>
