<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Both low and high platelet MAO-B (pMAO-B) activity is considered an indicator of increased vulnerability in psychopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>How the activity of this peripheral enzyme can be linked with the sophisticated functions of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) is not clear; in man, evidence exists that the genetic mechanisms determining the size or capacity of the central <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> system are common to platelet and brain MAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study pMAO-B activity was evaluated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients suffering from early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e>), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> categories, the relationship between pMAO-B activity and clinical features, and between pMAO-B activity and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) <z:chebi fb="3" ids="25375">monoamine</z:chebi> metabolites (3-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32772">methoxy</z:chebi>-4-hydroxyphenyl-<z:chebi fb="10" ids="13643">glycol</z:chebi>, MHPG; 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid, 5-HIAA; homovanillic acid, HVA) was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>pMAO-B activity was significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> patients, compared to controls and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age, as covariate, failed to show any significant effect, and no association was found between pMAO-B activity and CSF <z:chebi fb="3" ids="25375">monoamine</z:chebi> metabolites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The correlation analysis between pMAO-B and neuropsychological scores showed a highly significant positive relationship with GBS-emotional impairment (N = 40, r = 0.72, p &lt; 0.01) in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This result suggests the importance of platelet MAO-B activity as biological marker also in old-age <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>, namely senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer type, where the increased activity of this enzyme might constitute a marker for vulnerability toward behavioural disturbance, i.e., emotional deterioration </plain></SENT>
