<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with 1-AD were divided into two groups, one had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alpha 1-ACT values and one had increased serum levels of alpha 1-ACT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase proteins were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2-MG), alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1-AT), ceruloplasmin (CER), transferrin (TRSF) and alpha 1-acid <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (alpha 1-ac.GL) were within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The C reactive protein (CRP) was occasionally detectable at low concentrations in e-AD, in both groups of 1-AD patients and in VD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Low serum concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6) were found in a higher proportion of 1-AD than in patients with e-AD or VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that increased levels of alpha 1-ACT along with occasional detection of IL-6 might be peripheral markers of the '<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> reaction' in the brain </plain></SENT>
