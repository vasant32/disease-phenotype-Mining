<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the neural substrates involved remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to identify the brain regions responsible for FAB performance in patients with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought a correlation between FAB scores and brain perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 117 subjects participated in this study (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> = 51, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> = 14, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> = 13, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> = 7, psychiatric disease = 7, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> = 11, controls = 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They underwent brain single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography with (99m)Tc-ethylcisteinate dimer, and we analyzed the data, using a regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) quantification software program, 3DSRT (3-dimensional stereotaxic region of interest template) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FAB scores had a moderately positive correlation with left callosomarginal and precentral rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparison of rCBF between high- and low-scoring FAB groups revealed that the latter showed significantly lower rCBF in the bilateral callosomarginal and left precentral regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results in this study suggest that the FAB mainly reflects the function of the callosomarginal and precentral segments, especially the left side, and that it might be a valid frontal lobe function test </plain></SENT>
