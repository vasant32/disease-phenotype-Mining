<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine secular trends in the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and its subtypes, four cross-sectional surveys were conducted among Hisayama residents aged 65 years or older in 1985, 1992, 1998, and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) significantly increased with time, while the prevalence of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) decreased from the 1985 survey to the 1998 survey and then increased in the 2005 survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a 17-year prospective study of a total of 668 elder residents without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, elevated midlife and late-life blood pressure were significant risk factors for the late-life <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of VaD, but not for that of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 15-year prospective study of 1,017 elder subjects, who underwent a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test, revealed that the age- and sex-adjusted incidence of VaD and AD significantly increased in subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 2-hour post-load plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were closely associated with increased risk of VaD and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a pathological study of Hisayama residents, higher levels of 2-hour post-load plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, fasting insulin, and HOMA-IR were significantly associated with increased likelihood of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>neuritic plaques</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
