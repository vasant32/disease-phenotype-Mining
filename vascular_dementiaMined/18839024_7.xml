<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">Minocycline</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi> derivative, reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and protected against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To study the neuroprotection mechanism of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, the influences of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> on expressions of inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) and endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS) were observed in the brains of Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rat model was established by permanent bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arteries occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Wistar rats were divideded into 3 groups randomly: sham-operation group (S group), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> model group (M group), and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> treatment group (MT group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The behaviour was tested with <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> and open-field task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expressions of iNOS and eNOS were measured by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The optical density value was measured by imaging analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Percentage of positive cells with iNOS and eNOS expression was analyzed with optical microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">Minocycline</z:chebi> attenuated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Inducible NOS was significantly down-regulated in MT group, compared with that in M group (P &lt; 0.01), while eNOS was significantly up-regulated, compared with that in M group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The expressions of iNOS and eNOS in M and MT groups were higher than those in S group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">Minocycline</z:chebi> can down-regulate the expression of iNOS and up-regulate the expression of eNOS in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, which restrains <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> to protect neural function </plain></SENT>
