<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients received i.v. infusions of Cere (10 or 30 ml) or placebo (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline) 5 days/week for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean score of change from baseline in the ADAS-cog and percent change from baseline in slow to fast EEG power ratio (PR) scores were the two primary endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlations between cognition and qEEG were also evaluated for both baseline scores and for scores of change from baseline in ADAS-cog and in qEEG parameters, including EEG power ratio (PR) as an index of EEG slowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline ADAS-cog scores showed significant positive correlations with delta power, theta power and PR scores, and correlated negatively with alpha activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These correlations indicating that an increased EEG slowing is associated with a worst cognitive performance in VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cere treatment improved cognitive performance significantly at the 10 ml dose and reduced EEG slowing with both 10 and 30 ml dosages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant positive correlation between PR and ADAS-cog scores of change from baseline was observed in Cere-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>According to results of this pilot study, it is concluded that Cere improves cognitive performance and reduces EEG slowing in patients with VaD, and that there is a positive relationship between changes in cognition and qEEG activity induced by Cere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The conduction of further regular clinical trials is required to confirm the potential utility of Cere in the treatment of VaD suggested by the present results </plain></SENT>
