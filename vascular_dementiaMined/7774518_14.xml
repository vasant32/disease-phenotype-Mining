<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since there have been few studies dealing with the profile of power spectra, the present investigation has focused on this aspect, constructing power spectra taken from 16 derivations and calculated by averaging twenty 2 sec epochs, using a serial array of frequencies from 1 to 32 Hz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The spectral analysis of the EEG, recorded under awake resting eyes closed (REC) and open (REO) conditions, was performed in 50 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), 37 with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) and 36 elderly controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three spectral profiles were found under REC: (i) type A, showing a dominant 6.5-12 Hz peak (44% AD, 97.3% VaD), although lower than in controls; (ii) type B, lacking a dominant peak in the 6.5-12 Hz band, but characterised by high power in 1-6.5 Hz band (44% AD, 2.7% VaD); (iii) type C, corresponding to a flat, low voltage, spectrum (12% AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unlike controls, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients showed an increased REO/REC power ratio in the 6.5-12 Hz band, especially in those with type B spectra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AD patients with type B spectra had an earlier age of disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
