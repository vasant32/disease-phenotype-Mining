<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Arterial stiffness constitutes a reduction in the ability of large arteries to readily accommodate the increase in blood ejected from the heart during systole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Propagation of the pulse wave or pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a relatively simple, non-invasive, and reproducible method to determine arterial stiffness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is mounting evidence that consistently implicates arterial stiffness in the pathogenesis of impaired cognitive function and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This paper summarizes this evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First, the majority (85%) of the twelve studies comprising over 6,000 individuals found a significant association between increased vascular stiffness and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in multivariate analysis after adjusting for age, educational level, and other factors that influence cognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Second, higher pulse wave velocity, adjusted for age and other factors, was associated with a greater amount of white matter hyperintensities on brain imaging, indicating cerebral small-vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Third, studies consistently indicate that higher PWV is a significant predictor of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourth, some data support the proposition that arterial stiffness (PWV) increases progressively from persons with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognitive function to those with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, and then to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifth, there is some suggestion that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi> that have a more favorable effect to reduce vascular stiffness are more likely to reduce the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data suggest that artery stiffness may be a useful clinical tool to detect individuals at risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the elderly </plain></SENT>
