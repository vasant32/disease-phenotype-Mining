<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (rCMRO2), oxygen extraction fraction (rOEF), and cerebral blood volume (rCBV) were investigated using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) in 16 patients with senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer's type (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e>), and compared with those of 6 nondemented and 3 demented patients with deep white matter high signal (DWMH) on T2-weighted MRI and 6 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>rCBF, rCMRO2 and rCBV were determined using C15O2, 15O2 and C15O, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>rCBF and CMRO2 were significantly decreased in the frontal, parietal and temporal cortex (P &lt; 0.05) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e>, and showed a significant correlation with the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with DWMH rCBF was significantly decreased in the parietal cortex and in the frontal white matter in nondemented patients, and in the cerebral cortex and white matter of most regions studied in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients (P &lt; 0.05), whereas rCMRO2 was significantly reduced in only the frontal and temporal cortex of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>rOEF was significantly increased in the parietal cortex of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> and in the white matter of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> or DWMH (P &lt; 0.05), and the increase in the frontal white matter significantly paralleled the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>rCBV was significantly decreased in the parietal and temporal cortex of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> (P &lt; 0.05), but not in any areas of those with DWMH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that rOEF is increased in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> and patients with DWMH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increase in rOEF in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> may be accounted for by reduction in rCBV resulting from decreased activity in the vasodilatory cholinergic system, impairment of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and white matter changes; the rOEF increase in patients with DWMH suggests relative preservation of oxidative metabolism compared to disturbed perfusion </plain></SENT>
