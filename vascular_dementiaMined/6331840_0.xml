<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of cerebrovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was done according to the Hachinski's ischemic score and X-ray CT findings, and the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was classified according to the DR scale originated by Hasegawa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PET scanning started at 10 minutes and ended at 50 minutes after administration of C-11-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and bloods were sampled at every 5-10 minutes during the PET scanning  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stimulation studies were performed after 3 or 7 days from control studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An educational broadcasting program was used as the verbal stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regional distribution of glycogenic metabolites (RDGM: mg/100 g brain), which was a semi-quantitation of the pool of glycogenic metabolites mainly amino acids, were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The RDGM values in elder <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects were significantly low compared with young <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects in frontal cortex (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The decline in frontal cortex metabolism could have been caused by the morphological changes in the course of aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In temporal cortex, there was no significance between two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RDGM increased significantly respond to the verbal stimuli in frontal and temporal cortex both young and elder <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The RDGM values in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> were significantly low (p less than 0.001) compared with elder <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects' in frontal and temporal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Significant difference existed between mild and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in frontal cortex (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
