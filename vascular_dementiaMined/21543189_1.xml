<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A group reminiscence approach (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GRA</z:e>) with reality orientation (RO) is widely used as a psychosocial intervention for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since clinical effectiveness was reported for the intervention, interest has been directed toward areas of the neuronal network that might be being stimulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the frontal lobe associated with social interaction was being stimulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we studied 24 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to conventional care, a 1-h session of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GRA</z:e> with RO was provided once a week for 3 months in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GRA</z:e>-RO arm (n=12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only supportive care was provided in the control arm (n=12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Before and after the interventions, cognitive function, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011570" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">depressive state</z:e>, and social activities were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism is associated with brain function, cerebral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism was measured by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regarding behavioral improvement, 10 patients in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GRA</z:e>-RO arm showed improvement compared with only two patients in the control arm, a significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PET demonstrated that metabolism in the anterior cingulate was increased in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GRA</z:e>-RO arm, whereas no significant changes were observed in the control arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GRA</z:e>-RO stimulates the anterior cingulate and has a positive effect on social interaction </plain></SENT>
