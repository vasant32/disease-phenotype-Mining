<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the basis for multifocal hypointense lesions within the brain as identified on T2*-weighted gradient-echo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging in patients with no known or presumed cause of these lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the first of a two-part study design, we retrospectively reviewed a case series of 38 patients whose gradient-echo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images showed multiple hypointense lesions within the brain parenchyma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one cases in which the cause was known or presumed (eg, head trauma or cavernous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp>) were excluded from further review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> studies and clinical findings of the remaining seven cases were reexamined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the second part, using a cohort study design with respect to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, we prospectively reviewed the gradient-echo images from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> studies of 65 patients and control subjects enrolled in two ongoing clinical studies, one on "possible vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>" (n = 33) and the other on "possible motor neuron disorder" (n = 32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the first part of the study, we found seven cases with a pattern of multiple hypointense lesions involving the deep gray matter nuclei, especially the basal ganglia (n = 6) and thalamus (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, involvement of the <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata (n = 5), brain stem (n = 4), and cerebellum (n = 3) was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical review revealed a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the cohort study, we found three of 65 persons who had two or more focal hypointense lesions that involved the basal ganglia or thalami </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Review of the clinical data showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients were being treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>; also, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three were patients from the "possible vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>" group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging pattern of multifocal hypointense lesions within the basal ganglia, thalamus, and other deep cerebral structures is more commonly found among patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> than in patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
