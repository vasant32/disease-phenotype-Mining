<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most common vascular risk factors are unremarkable in CADASIL; however, studies on systemic blood pressure (BP) changes over time are substantially lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because BP instability is a relevant risk factor for developing or worsening white matter changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> SIVD, we aimed to study the BP profile of CADASIL to investigate its relationship with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and white matter injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four-hour ambulatory BP monitoring was performed in a group of 14 CADASIL patients (12 males and 2 females) and in a group of 15 healthy age-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following BP variables were compared between the 2 groups: mean daytime and nighttime systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial BP (SABPday, DABPday, and MABPday, and SABPnight, DABPnight, and MABPnight) and nocturnal percentage decline in arterial BP (%MABP reduction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cognitive performances were tested by mini mental status examination (MMSE), and brain MRI was performed to extrapolate the T2-weighted lesion volume (LV) in each CADASIL patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 24-hour arterial BP variables were compared between CADASIL and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, for CADASIL patients only, MMSE, LV, and age were compared with each pressure variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with CADASIL showed a significant reduction (P&lt;0.05) of SABPday, DABPday, MABPday and %MABP decline with respect to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, MMSE of CADASIL subjects correlated significantly (P&lt;0.0001) with daytime MABP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The low systemic BP profile observed in CADASIL patients was specifically attributable to reduced diurnal BP values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This may further affect cerebral hemodynamics and increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of abnormal BP profile in CADASIL remains to be clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is likely that central and peripheral mechanisms controlling BP variations are involved </plain></SENT>
