<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current narrow definitions of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) should be broadened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>VaD is characterised by a specific cognitive profile involving preserved memory with impairments in attentional and executive functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed at a) Investigating whether VaD/pts showed the marked decrease in selective attentional functioning different from the healthy ageing population; b) Determining norms for the Digit Symbol Coding (DSC) task performance for the Georgian elderly population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Case-control study of selective attentional performance was conducted by forming groups of 15 VaD/pts (mean age M=65,6; SD=8,64), 64 young (aged 17-25 years with M=20,69; SD=2.97) and 64 healthy old subjects (aged 50-75 years with M=59,77; SD=7,13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Severity levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> determined by MMSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VaD/pts were administered the qualitative assessment procedure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> for excluding the cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The selective attentional functioning was studies by the DSC task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant difference was detected on the DSC task for the three study groups F(2,62)=87,030, p&lt;.0001 using one-way ANOVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Norms for the selective attention functioning were prepared for the Georgian elderly population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The study results showed that attentional disorder is a prominent characteristic of VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The DSC task reveals ageing effect and differentiates performance of VaD/pts from the performance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly participants </plain></SENT>
