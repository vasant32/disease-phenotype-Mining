<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This paper makes an outline case for the need for a low-cost, easy to administer method for detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> within the growing at risk population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It proposes two methods for electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis for detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> that could fulfil such a need </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The paper describes a fractal dimension-based method for analyzing the EEG waveforms of subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and reports on an assessment which demonstrates that an appropriate fractal dimension measure could achieve 67% sensitivity to probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (as suggested by clinical psychometric testing and EEG findings) with a specificity of 99.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An alternative method based on the probability density function of the zero-crossing intervals is shown to achieve 78% sensitivity to probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and an estimated sensitivity to probable Vascular (or mixed) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of 35% (as suggested by clinical psychometric testing and EEG findings) with a specificity of 99.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This compares well with other studies, reported by the American Academy of Neurology, which typically provide a sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The EEG recordings used to assess these methods included artefacts and had no a priori selection of elements "suitable for analysis." This approach gives a good prediction of the usefulness of the methods, as they would be used in practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 39 patients (30 probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e>, six Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> and three mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) and 42 healthy volunteers were involved in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, although results from the preliminary evaluation of the methods are promising, there is a need for a more extensive study to validate the methods using EEGs from a larger and more varied patient cohorts with neuroimaging results, to exclude other causes and cognitive scores to correlate results with severity of cognitive status </plain></SENT>
