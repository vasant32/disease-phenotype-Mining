<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, support for this association mainly comes from cross-sectional studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> during long follow-up, with various noninvasive measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was based on 6,647 participants in the Rotterdam Study, a population-based prospective cohort study among 7,983 elderly subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At baseline (1990-1993) and at the third survey (1997-1999), common carotid intima media thickness, carotid plaques, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> (measured as ankle-brachial index) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During follow-up (mean, 9.0 years), 678 subjects developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We estimated the associations of different measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> with risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> by means of Cox proportional hazard models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analyses were repeated and stratified on duration of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To evaluate competing risk for mortality, we examined the association between measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or mortality by combining the two in a single outcome measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, predominantly carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, was associated with an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> during short follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This association attenuated with longer follow-up, likely because of the strong association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The associations did not differ across <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is associated with an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Stronger associations between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and mortality may attenuate the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in prospective cohort studies with long follow-up periods </plain></SENT>
