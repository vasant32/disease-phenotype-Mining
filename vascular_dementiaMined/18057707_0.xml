<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effect of chotosan, an oriental medicine, which has been clinically demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, on M-CSF gene expression in rats with permanent occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries (P2VO) in vivo and in a C6Bu-1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> cell line in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression level of M-CSF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the cerebral cortices of P2VO rats was significantly higher than that in the cerebral cortices of sham-operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Repeated treatment of P2VO rats with chotosan (75 mg/kg per day) for 4 d after P2VO significantly increased the expression level of M-CSF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the cortex but it had no effect on the expression of beta-actin, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the present in vitro studies revealed that chotosan treatment (10-100 mug/ml) of C6Bu-1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> cells dose-dependently enhanced M-CSF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression without affecting the expression of G-CSF, GM-CSF, and inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of chotosan was reversed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38912">Ro 31-8220</z:chebi> (1 muM), a selective protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, but not by H-89 (10 muM), a selective protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the upregulatory effect of chotosan on M-CSF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression involves PKC and may play an important role in the anti-vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> action of this formula </plain></SENT>
