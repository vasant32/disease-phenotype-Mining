<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, identification of biomarkers that signal potential points of intervention during this prodromal phase (during which patients are largely able to compensate for their <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo>) is of paramount importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin is a pancreatic hormone with potent central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system effects, and insulin dysregulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of both AD and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to determine whether circulating insulin differs as a function of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) diagnosis, and whether this relationship is mediated by sex and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (APOE) genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A sample of 549 nondemented participants aged 65 and over from the Adult Changes in Thought community-based cohort underwent cognitive testing and blood draw to determine fasting levels of plasma insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects were categorized as having <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognitive functioning, amnestic MCI, or nonamnestic MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results showed that the relationship between insulin and diagnostic category is moderated by sex, such that men with nonamnestic or amnestic MCI have higher fasting plasma insulin than cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> men, while women with amnestic MCI have lower fasting plasma insulin than cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exploratory analyses suggest that APOE Îµ4 genotype may further influence the relationship between sex and insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Future research will help determine whether insulin dysregulation results in differential effects on vascular function and AD pathology as a function of sex and/or APOE genotype </plain></SENT>
