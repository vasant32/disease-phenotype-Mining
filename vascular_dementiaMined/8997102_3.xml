<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Similar tests on Japanese subjects showed significant differences in pupil response between subjects with Alzheimer-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (under age 70 years) and age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study included 24 patients with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> Alzheimer-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 29 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> Alzheimer-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 15 healthy controls (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> spouse of patients with Alzheimer-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>), 9 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 5 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After adapting to semi-darkness (10 lux), a solution of tropicamide (Midrin-P, Santen Co, Ltd) was instilled into the right eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pupil diameters were measured every 5 to 10 min, and the maximum pupil diameter for each eye was used in the data analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The solution was diluted until the tropicamide concentration reached 0.01% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pupil diameters were measured, and differences between baseline and maximum pupil diameter were computed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 18 patients with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> Alzheimer-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (mean age 63.9 years) the pupils dilated by 1.12 +/- 0.52 mm (mean +/- SD) as compared with 0.20 +/- 0.75 mm in 7 age-matched controls (mean age 57.8 years); this difference was significant (T-test, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Correlations between the degrees of pupillary dilation and the scores on the revised version of Hasegawa's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Scale were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that in subjects under 70 years of age, the diagnostic methods described by Scinto et al. can be used to distinguish those with Alzheimer-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> from those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, but those methods may not be effective in subjects over 70 years of age </plain></SENT>
