<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cortical biopsies were taken from the frontal lobe of 25 patients with presenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">Choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity, and in some specimens the high affinity uptake of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi>, was used to estimate loss of cholinergic nerve terminals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 15 samples with varying degrees of histological evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) 14 were from clinically suspected examples of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was significant loss of ChAT in 10 of the 15 compared with control and the mean activity was also highly significantly reduced (to 41% of control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The deficit was found in patients examined within a year of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 6 biopsies from clinically suspected cases of AD without diagnostic histological features there was loss of activity in only one, subsequently shown to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining samples were two of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (no loss of ChAT), one probable disorder of white matter (no loss of activity) and one undiagnosed disorder (with loss of ChAT activity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus most patients without histologically demonstrated AD had no evidence of a presynaptic cholinergic defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that suspected cases of AD particularly suitable for putative cholinergic therapy were those with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease at 55 to 65 and an absence of family history </plain></SENT>
