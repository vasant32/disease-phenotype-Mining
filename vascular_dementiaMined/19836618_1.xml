<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The attention of medical research is now focused on establishing a possible role of AF in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in order to include this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> among risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to investigate the relationship between AF and various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, such as vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study consisted of 71 VaD, AD or MD patients, 31 males and 40 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sample has been divided in 2 groups according to the sex, and these two groups have been analyzed separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In females, a statistically significant association was found between mini mental state examination (MMSE) and clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rating (CDR) scores and AF occurrence (r=-0.32; p&lt;0.05; r=0.33; p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, no significant linear correlation was found between AF and a lower activities if daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities if daily living (IADL) scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In males, AF/MMSE, AF/CDR, AF/ADL and AF/IADL variables have not been found to be linearly related to each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, AF turned to be associated to AD more often than to VAD, becoming a possible risk factor for this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results are supported by many studies in literature attributing a basic role of brain hypoperfusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> AD patho-genesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More and more scientific data suggest that the already well known risk factors for AD could be considered just the top of an iceberg, providing powerful arguments for impaired cerebral perfusion as the primary trigger in the development of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the mildly favorable treatment response in patients with AD to therapy that improves cerebral blood flow is a consistent finding; the same cannot be said of antiamyloid treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This opens new possibilities to find an effective way to treat this dramatic pathology </plain></SENT>
