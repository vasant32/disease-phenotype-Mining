<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE: Few drugs have been reported to be effective for the treatment of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Choto-san is a herbal medicine expected to be effective in this condition, but it is unclear how this drug modulates brain activities and cognitive functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>P3 event-related brain potentials (ERP) provide reliable electrophysiological indices for some aspects of cognitive functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We measured P3 ERP to assess the effect of Choto-san administration on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Choto-san was given for 12 weeks to ten <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>P3 ERP were recorded before and after drug administration in a modified auditory oddball paradigm including occasional novel sounds using a high-density array EEG recording system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reproducibility of ERP was also assessed in other ten <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with a 12-week interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cognitive functions were assessed with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and verbal fluency test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve-week administration of Choto-san significantly improved MMSE and verbal fluency test scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reproducibility of P3 latency and amplitude to target and novel sounds was excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>P3 latency to target sounds was shortened in association with reduced reaction time to the sounds after drug administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, P3 amplitude to novel sounds was enlarged and its topography shifted from central to frontal sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that Choto-san improves electrophysiological indices related to attention and decision making, in addition to neuropsychological test scores in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
