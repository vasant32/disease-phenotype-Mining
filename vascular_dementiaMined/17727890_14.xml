<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess age-, gender, and subtype-specific incidence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in three populations in central Spain using data from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> in Central Spain (NEDICES), a population-based survey of elderly participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Individuals were evaluated at baseline (1994-1995) and at follow-up (a median of 3.2 years later in 1997-1998) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The evaluation included a screening questionnaire for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and a neurological assessment, when possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 5278 participants evaluated at baseline, there were 306 prevalent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred and sixty-one incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases were identified among 3,891 individuals assessed at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The large majority had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD): 115 (71.4%) AD, 18 (11.2%) vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), 11 (6.8%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo>, 11 (6.8%) undetermined etiology, and 6 (3.7%) secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Average annual incidence rates (per 1,000 person-years) in the population aged 65 to 90 and over years, adjusted to the standard European population, were 10.6 (95% CI, 8.9 to 12.3) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 7.4 (95% CI=6.0 to 8.8) for AD, and 1.4 (95% CI=0.6 to 2.3) for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age-specific incidence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and AD increased exponentially with advancing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and illiteracy were independent risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aggregation of vascular risk factors was related to a higher risk of both VaD and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the NEDICES study, incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> increased with age beyond age 85 and AD was the most frequent type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The risk of AD and VaD increased with the number of vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
