<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These changes were represented by lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, foci of incomplete <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, perivascular encephalolysis, more seldom by small haemorrhages in combination with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, cribriform lesions and widespread spongiosis of the white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Alterations of the cortex-medullary arteries, microcirculatory bed, disturbances of the dynamics of liquor and permeability of blood-brain barrier play the most important role in the white matter damage </plain></SENT>
