<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of tau protein and amyloid beta(1-42) <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (Abeta42) have been suggested as possible diagnostic markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate their diagnostic potential in clinical practice, we measured tau and Abeta42 levels in the CSF of 49 AD patients, 15 patients with non-AD neurodegenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> (NAND), six patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) and 49 elderly controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the subjects were of Greek origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A marked increase in tau, a decrease in Abeta42 and a marked increase in the tau/Abeta42 ratio was noted in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abeta42 alone had a specificity of 80% and a sensitivity of 82% in differentiating AD from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ageing, whilst the corresponding values for differentiating AD from NAND or VD were 80 and 71, or 67 and 82%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tau was better in differentiating AD, from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ageing (specificity 96%, sensitivity 88%), NAND (specificity 93%, sensitivity 71%) and VD (specificity 83%, sensitivity 94%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The tau/Abeta42 ratio achieved values comparable or even better than tau for differentiating AD from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ageing (specificity 86%, sensitivity 96%) and VD (specificity 83%, sensitivity 90%) and definitely better than any of the candidate markers alone, for differentiating AD from NAND (specificity 100%, sensitivity 71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the combined use of CSF tau and Abeta42 in the form of the tau/Abeta42 ratio is a simple, safe and useful adjuvant to clinical criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
