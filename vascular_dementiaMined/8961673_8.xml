<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In stage one, the Chinese Mini-Mental Status Examination (CMMSE) and Blessed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating Scale were employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In stage two, a comprehensive neurobehavioral examination and neuropsychologic tests were administered by neurologists and neuropsychologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was defined by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R criteria </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 1,016 randomly selected elderly people participated in phase one: 131 people with CMMSE below cutoff values participated in phase two, of whom 45 were confirmed to have a form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in this sample was 4.4% (3.2% in men and 5.8% in women): 2.0% for those 65 to 74 years old, 8.3% for those 75 to 84 and 24.4% for those &gt; or = 85 years old; 6.0% for those who were illiterate, 3.3% for those who attended grade-school; and 2.8% for those who finished junior-high-school </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AD (22 cases, 48.9%) was the most common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, followed by VaD (11 cases, 24.4%) and mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MIX: 5 cases, 11.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Old age and being female were significant high risk factors for AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Medical history indicated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were significant risk factors for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A relatively high prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was observed in this study, probably because we assessed neurobehavior in great detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although AD was the leading cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the present population sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>VaD and MIX also comprised an important proportion, reflecting the high prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Older women had high risk for AD, not for VaD; and those with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> had high risk for VaD, not for AD </plain></SENT>
