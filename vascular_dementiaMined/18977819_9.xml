<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the progression of either VaD or AD+<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare demographic features, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and survival of patients with VaD, AD+<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and AD alone attending a memory clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included 970 patients who were followed at the Lille-Bailleul memory clinic, France </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cognitive functions were measured with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating Scale (DRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival rate was analysed with a left-truncated Cox model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, education, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and baseline MMSE and DRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 970 patients, 141 had VaD, 663 AD alone and 166 AD+<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The latter were significantly older than AD or VaD patients at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (71 (SD 7) vs 69 (9) and 68 (9) years, p = 0.01) and at first visit (75 (6) vs 73 (8) and 72 (8) years, p = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Baseline MMSE and DRS evaluations were highest for VaD compared with AD alone or AD+<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> patients (p&lt;0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>Cognitive decline</z:hpo> during follow-up was slowest for VaD, intermediate for AD+<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and fastest for AD alone (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After adjustment, compared with AD patients, mortality risk was similar for those with VaD (relative mortality risk (RR) = 0.7 (0.5 to 1.1)) and tended to be lower for AD+<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> (RR = 0.7 (0.5 to 1.0)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The shorter the delay between first symptoms and first visit, the longer patients survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This clinical cohort study shows that patients with VaD, AD+<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and AD present different characteristics at baseline and during follow-up, and underlines the need to distinguish between them </plain></SENT>
