<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have documented the increase of risk for AD among the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E gene allele 4 (ApoE4) carriers in Taiwanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is a consensus that ApoE4 is the most important risk factor for AD at present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The researchers also found that ApoE4 allele frequency is lower in Taiwanese, around 7%, than it in the most Caucasian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon raises the hypothesis that low ApoE4 allele frequency contributes to low prevalence of AD in Taiwanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Besides, many genetic studies were involved in genetic impacts on modulation or regulation of the manifestation, progression, and treatment response of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>But, these genetic studies are still inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Few familial AD attributed to PS1 gene mutation has been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The genetic studies of VsD are just beginning and NOTCH3 gene mutation has been detected in Taiwanese cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> with subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> (CADASIL) families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since there is a large proportion of non- ApoE4-associated AD in Taiwanese, it remains more researches to look for novel genetic factors in Taiwanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on the Japanese experience of studies, the association between the polymorphisms of ApoE and familial AD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AD respectively warrants further investigation </plain></SENT>
