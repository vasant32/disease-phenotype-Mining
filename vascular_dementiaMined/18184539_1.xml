<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MCI clinical criteria and diagnostic procedure from the MCI Working Group of the European <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Consortium (EADC) may better reflect the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of MCI syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Beijing United Study Group on MCI funded by the Capital Foundation of Medical Developments (CFMD) proposed the guiding principles of clinical research on MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic methods include clinical, neuropsychological, functional, neuroimaging and genetic measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic procedure includes three stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Firstly, MCI syndrome must be defined, which should correspond to: (1) cognitive complaints coming from the patients or their families; (2) reporting of a relative decline in cognitive functioning during the past year by the patient or informant; (3) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009241" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disorders</z:e> evidenced by clinical evaluation; (4) activities of daily living preserved and complex instrumental functions either intact or minimally impaired; and (5) absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondly, subtypes of MCI have to be recognized as amnestic MCI (aMCI), single non-memory MCI (snmMCI) and multiple-domains MCI (mdMCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, the subtype causes could be identified commonly as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1285162" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">degenerative diseases</z:e> such as frontal-temporal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (FTD), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752347" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="DLB">Lewy body disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBD</z:e>), semantic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (SM), as well as trauma, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, toxicity and nutrition deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The recommended special tests include serum <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi>, plasma insulin, insulin-degrading enzyme, Abeta40, Abeta42, inflammatory factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (or preferentially magnetic resonance imaging, when available) is mandatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As measurable therapeutic outcomes, the primary outcome should be the probability of progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, the secondary outcomes should be cognition and function, and the supplement outcome should be the syndrome defined by traditional Chinese medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>And for APOE epsilon4 carrier, influence of the carrier status on progression rate to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and the effect of treatment should be evaluated </plain></SENT>
