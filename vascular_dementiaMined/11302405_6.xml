<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report the use of gabapentin in the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (BPSD) and to review the available literature relating to the use of gabapentin in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE SUMMARY: A 62-year-old white man was admitted to the hospital due to a worsening state of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, depressed mood, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo>, and verbal and physical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> toward his wife </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He had a past medical history significant for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He had been intolerant of or had failed to respond to numerous antidepressants, <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepines</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="25" ids="35476">neuroleptics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The addition of gabapentin to the patient's medication regimen resulted in reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo>, sexual inappropriateness, and lability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He was discharged to his home on a dose of gabapentin 300 mg three times daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search (1966-August 2000) was performed to identify case reports and clinical trials discussing the efficacy of gabapentin in the treatment of BPSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Gabapentin, like other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsants</z:chebi>, has been used with success in several psychiatric illnesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Available literature indicates that the drug may have some efficacy in the treatment of BPSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It has a favorable adverse effect profile in the elderly, which makes it an attractive altemative to standard therapies, including <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepines</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="25" ids="35476">neuroleptics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Optimal dosing remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that gabapentin is a reasonable alternative therapy for patients whose behavioral symptoms do not respond to conventional agents </plain></SENT>
