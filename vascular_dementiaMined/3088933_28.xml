<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reports in the literature have implicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> due to subcortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger disease</z:e>) as the cause of these lucencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger disease</z:e>, however, is thought to be rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of this apparent discrepancy we decided to determine the incidence and to attempt to define the clinical significance of the CT white-matter changes in a study population at New York University Medical Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The studies of 275 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> subjects, ages 23 to 85 years, were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects received neurologic, psychiatric, and medical evaluation, formal psychometric evaluation of their cognitive status, and a CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CT scans were evaluated for the presence and severity of white-matter changes (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence and severity of white-matter changes increased significantly with age (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>Leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> was consistently more common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, but the difference was not statistically significant, and the severity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> was not related to the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five patients (ages 74 to 95 years) with a clinical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> who had CT evidence of lucencies were examined at autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neuropathology demonstrated extensive changes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> in one brain and mild-to-moderate changes in the other four brains; areas of white-matter rarefaction were present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> brains, with microscopic evidence of arteriolar hyalinization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> is strongly related to the aging process and is seen in both "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" and cognitively impaired individuals who have no other evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
