<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The major neuropathological lesions defining <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) include <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo> and amyloid plaques, which are mainly composed of abnormally phosphorylated tau and amyloid-beta (A beta), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Numerous neuropathological and neuroimaging studies indicate that at least one-third of AD cases are complicated by some degree of vascular pathology, whereas in a similar proportion of patients clinically diagnosed with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, AD pathology is also present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many classical vascular risk factors such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> have recently been shown also to increase the risk of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Growing evidence suggests that vascular pathology lowers the threshold for the clinical presentation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at a given level of AD-related pathology and potentially directly promotes AD lesions such as A beta plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, chronically up-regulates expression of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is the precursor to the amyloid beta <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and damages the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>), affecting A beta <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> clearance from the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recognition of the importance of these vascular risk factors for AD-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and their treatment will be beneficial not only for preventing cardiac, cerebral, and peripheral complications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, but also will likely have a direct impact on the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> AD in older subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we review some of the links between vascular risk factors and AD pathology and present data on the direct effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> on cognitive function and A beta deposition in a mouse model of AD </plain></SENT>
