<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several studies point to a potential aetiological relevance to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of exposure to low-frequency magnetic fields, but the evidence is inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To further examine the relationship between low frequency magnetic fields and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 23 general practices, 195 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 108 had possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 59 had possible vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 28 had secondary or unclassified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 229 controls were recruited: 122 population controls and 107 ambulatory patients free from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were gathered in a structured personal interview; in cases, the interview was administered to the next of kin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exposure to low-frequency electromagnetic fields was assessed by expert rating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To identify occupations suspected to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, major occupations were a priori formed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios were calculated using logistic regression, to control for age, region, sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in parents and smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Exposure to magnetic fields was not significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; restriction of the analysis to cases with possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> or possible vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> did not lead to statistically significant results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in blue-collar occupations (electrical and electronics workers, metal workers, construction workers, food and beverage processors and labourers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study does not support a strong association between occupational exposure to low-frequency magnetic fields and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies should consider the relationship between blue-collar work and the late development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
