<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Kunming mice were randomly divided into sham-operation (sham, n = 13), model (n = 15), EA (n = 16) and Nimodipine (intragastric gavage, 30 mg/kg for 15 days, n = 15) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>VD model was duplicated by occlusion of bilateral carotid arteries and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EA (2-80 Hz, 2 mA) was applied to "Dazhui" (GV 14), "Baihui" (GV 20), "Geshu" (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> 17) and "Zusanli" (ST 36) for 10 min, once daily for 15 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Step-down and step-up tests were performed to assess the animal's memory and learning abilities separately; and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-nick end-labeling (TUNEL) method was used to display the apoptotic cells of the hippocampus tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In comparison with sham group, the animals' reaction time upon electric shock stimulation, both step-up and step-down error times, and hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> number in model, EA and Nimodipine groups increased significantly (P&lt;0.01), while the reaction latency upon electric shock of model, EA and Nimodipine groups decreased significantly (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with model group, the reaction time, both step-up and step-down error times and hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> number of both EA and Nimodipine groups decreased significantly (P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01); while the reaction latency of EA and Nimodipine groups increased considerably (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparison between EA and Nimodipine groups showed that the reaction latency of EA group was obviously longer than that of the later group (P&lt;0.01), and the step-down error times of EA group was markedly lower than that of Nimodipine group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between these two groups in other indexes (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EA can ameliorate VD mice's learning-memory ability, which may be closely related to its effect in reducing hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
