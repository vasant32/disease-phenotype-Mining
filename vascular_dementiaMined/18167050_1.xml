<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its marked <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity has recently been demonstrated in both cell lines and animals </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">Glutamate</z:chebi> cysteine ligase (GCL) is the rate-limiting enzyme for GSH synthesis and its catalytic subunit (GCLC) determines this de novo synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, induction of GCLC is a strategy to enhance the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> capability in cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to investigate the induction effect of EGb on GCLC in HepG2 and Hep1c1c7 cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Real-time PCR, Western blot and enzyme activity assay were used to detect induction and it was found that GCLC was induced by EGb in these two cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity of EGb is (or is partly) through the induction of GCLC </plain></SENT>
