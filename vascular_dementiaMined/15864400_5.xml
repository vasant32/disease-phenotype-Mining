<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the role of comorbidity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> on the prevalence of disability in a cohort of hospitalized older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 179 patients aged 65 years and over admitted to the Geriatric Unit of the Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza Hospital, in Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cognitive status was evaluated by means of the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating Scale (CDR); the functional status was evaluated according to the Activity of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comorbidity was identified using the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS index) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 179 patients enrolled 73 patients were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> [Alzheimers' Disease (AD) = 49 patients, Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> (VD) = 24 patients], 35 patients with Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive Impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) and 71 patients had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The severity of disability was significantly higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (ADL = 3.1 +/- 2.1, IADL = 1.5 +/- 2.0) than patients with MCI (ADL = 5.1 +/- 1.4, IADL = 5.2 +/- 2.2) (p &lt; 0.0001) and patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (ADL = 5.5 +/- 0.9, IADL = 6.4 +/- 1.9) (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in CIRS index were observed between patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and MCI and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> = 2.4 +/- 1.4 vs MCI = 2.9 +/- 1.4 vs No <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> = 2.7 +/- 1.2; p = 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a significant correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and functional status (MMSE/ADL: r = 0.45, p = 0.0001, MMSE/IADL: r = 0.54, p = 0.0001) but not between comorbidity and functional status (CIRS/ADL: r = 0.0007, CIRS/IADL: r = 0.040) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Separating patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> by diagnosis of AD or VD, no significant differences in MMSE (AD = 12.2 +/- 6.7 vs VD = 13.2 +/- 6.5, p = 0.6), CDR (AD = 2.2 +/- 0.8 vs VD = 2.1 +/- 0.7, p = 0.6), ADL (AD = 3.1 +/- 2.1 vs VD = 3.0 +/- 2.1, p = 0.8), IADL (AD = 1.3 +/- 1.9 vs VD = 2.0 +/- 2.2, p = 0.1) or CIRS (AD = 2.2 +/- 1.5 vs VD = 2.8 +/- 1.3, p = 0.06) scores were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and not comorbidity, was significantly associated with disability in hospitalized older patients </plain></SENT>
