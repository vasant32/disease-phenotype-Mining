<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report its organization and the impact of diagnostic criteria on the study of VCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine memory disability clinics enrolled patients and recorded their usual investigations and care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A case report form included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) individual criteria for each of four sets (National Institute of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> (NINDS-AIREN), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Diagnostic Treatment Centers (ADDTC), the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10 Classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0556006" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental and Behavioural Disorders</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10), and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV)) of consensus-based diagnostic criteria and for the Hachinski <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> Score (HIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Investigators, having completed the case report form, were asked to make a clinical judgement about the cognitive diagnosis based on the best available information, including neuroimaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 1,347 patients (mean age 72 years; 56% women), 846 (63%) were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 324 (24%) were diagnosed with VCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients diagnosed with VaD by the diagnostic criteria was: 23.9% (n = 322) by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV, 10.2% (n = 137) by HIS, 4.3% (n = 58) by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10, 3.8% (n = 51) by ADTCC, and 3.6% (n = 48) by NINDS-AIREN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Judged against a clinical diagnosis of VaD, the sensitivity/specificity of each was: <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV (0.77/0.80); HIS (0.41/0.92); <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10 (0.29/0.98); ADTCC (0.24/0.98); NINDS-AIREN (0.42/0.995) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with a clinical diagnosis of VCI, sensitivities were lower for the diagnostic criteria, reflecting the exclusion of patients who did not have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Consensus-based criteria for VaD omit patients who do not meet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> criteria that are modeled on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Even for patients who do, the proportion identified with VaD varies widely </plain></SENT>
