<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>White matter hyperintensities (WMH), lacunar lesions (LL), cerebral microhemorrhages (CM), brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and tissue microstructural changes are detected on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using an integrated multi-modal approach, we examined the relative impact of lesion burden and location of these MRI markers on <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multi-modal imaging was performed on 147 patients from a two-center cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Volume of LL, WMH and number of CM was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whole brain mean apparent diffusion coefficient (mean-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) and brain parenchymal fraction (BPF) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate models accounting for lesion burden and location, volume of LL, mean-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, and BPF each had an independent influence on global cognitive function and disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BPF explained the largest portion of the variation in cognitive and disability scores (35-38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> has the strongest independent influence on clinical impairment in CADASIL when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> MRI markers in the disease are considered together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the clinical impact of cerebral tissue loss plays a principal role in this genetic model of subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
