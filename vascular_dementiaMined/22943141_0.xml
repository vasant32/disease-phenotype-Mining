<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Recently, we found <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15727">carnosine</z:chebi> protects against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-Methyl-D-Aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) induced excitotoxicity through a histaminergic pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15727">carnosine</z:chebi>-histidine-<z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> pathway also played a protective role in subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (SIVD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male mice (C57BL/6 strain) were subjected to right unilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arteries occlusion</z:mp> (rUCCAO) and treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15727">carnosine</z:chebi> or histidine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Object recognition test, passive avoidance task, <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp>, and immunohistochemical analyses were performed after rUCCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15727">carnosine</z:chebi> (200, 500 mg/kg) ameliorated white matter lesion and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> evaluated by object recognition test, passive avoidance task, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> test after rUCCAO in both wide-type mice and histidine decarboxylase knockout mice, which are lack of endogenous <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, administration of histidine did not show the same effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The myelin basic protein in the corpus callosum decreased obviously at day 37 after rUCCAO, which was largely reversed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15727">carnosine</z:chebi> (200, 500 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15727">Carnosine</z:chebi> (200, 500 mg/kg) suppressed the activation of microglia and astrocyte as attenuating the elevation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Iba-1 fluorescent intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15727">carnosine</z:chebi> (200, 500 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the increase in reactive oxygen species generation after rUCCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the neuroprotective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15727">carnosine</z:chebi> on rUCCAO in mice is not dependent on the histaminergic pathway, but may be due to a suppression of reactive oxygen species generation, glia activation, and myelin degeneration </plain></SENT>
