<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Case reports and clinical observations suggest that fluctuating cognition (FC) is common in the major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>, particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>), where it is one of three core clinical diagnostic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To examine the frequency, characteristics, and diagnostic utility of FC in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> using clinical, attentional, and EEG markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Method:- A total of 155 subjects (61 with AD, 37 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>, 22 with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> [VaD], 35 elderly controls) received clinical evaluation for FC using a semiquantified measure applied by experienced clinicians and 90-second cognitive choice reaction time (CRT) and vigilance reaction time (VIGRT) trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty subjects also received an evaluation of mean EEG frequency across 90 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> had a greater prevalence and severity of FC than did patients with AD or VaD rated using clinical, attentional, and EEG measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 90-second cognitive and EEG trials demonstrated that FC occurs on a second-to-second basis in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with VaD had a higher prevalence of FC than did those with AD, although the profile of FC was different from that expressed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Optimal cutoff values on the clinical scale achieved good discrimination between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups (sensitivity 81%, specificity 92%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> versus AD; sensitivity 81%, specificity 82%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> versus VaD; sensitivity 64%, specificity 77%, VaD versus AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Standardized assessment methods demonstrate that FC is significantly more common and severe in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> than in other major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The periodicity of FC is different in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> and VaD cases, with important implications for the underlying causal mechanisms and for differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
