<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test the effect of pentoxifylline, a hemorheologic agent used to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0004417'>intermittent claudication</z:hpo>, on the course of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Outpatient tertiary care center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 64 patients meeting <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III criteria for multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with modified Hachinski ischemic scores greater than or equal to 6, 38 of whom completed the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Pentoxifylline (Trental) 400 milligram tablets three times daily vs placebo for 36 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Assessment Scale (ADAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline demographic values and psychometric variables were similar in the placebo and control groups; endpoint statistical analysis was used to allow the use of data from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in this clinically high-risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the total group, the slowing of deterioration did not reach statistical significance (by 2-tailed t test), as measured by scores on the total ADAS (P = 0.058) or on the cognitive (ADAS items 1-11; P = 0.064) or non-cognitive subscales (ADAS items 12-21; P = 0.234), although it was significant on the cognitive subscales excluding memory (ADAS items 2-6, 8-10; P = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the subgroup of 40 patients who had CT and/or MRI evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as well as meeting the other inclusion criteria, treatment with pentoxifylline was associated with significantly slower deterioration, as measured by the total ADAS (P = 0.023) and cognitive subscores (P = 0.020) but not non-cognitive subscores (P = 0.118) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For the subgroup of 37 patients who had at least one discrete clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, treatment with pentoxifylline was associated with significantly less deterioration on the total ADAS (P = 0.002) and both the cognitive (P = 0.001) and non-cognitive (P = 0.017) subscores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Treatment with pentoxifylline may slow the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in patients who meet <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III criteria for "multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>" and who also have clinical and neuroradiological evidence of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
