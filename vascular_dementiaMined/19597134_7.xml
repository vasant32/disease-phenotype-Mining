<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Ninety-eight cognitively intact elderly subjects were followed in the Oregon Brain Aging Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine had at least 3 brain MRIs and annual cognitive and neurologic assessments until diagnosed with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (PCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain, ventricular CSF (vCSF), intracranial volume (ICV), hippocampus, total WMH, periventricular (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) WMH, and subcortical WMH volumes were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards survival analyses were used to assess <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjusting for age, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E4 status, incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, ICV, entry Mini-Mental State Examination, baseline hippocampus, and both baseline vCSF volume and rate of vCSF volume change, increased progression of total WMH volume (hazard ratio [HR] 1.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-2.7, p = 0.0007) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> WMH volume (HR 1.94, 95% CI 1.3-3.1, p = 0.001) conferred higher risk of PCI, whereas baseline WMH volumes did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Every 1 mL/y increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> WMH volume was associated with a 94% increased risk of PCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Progression of total and periventricular (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes are better predictors of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (PCI) than baseline WMH burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Greater <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> WMH burden progression is associated with the development of PCI, a potential precursor to Alzheimer or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
