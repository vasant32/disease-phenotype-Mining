<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although a blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of these white matter (WM) lesions, few authors have addressed this problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we describe <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> dysfunction and its regional differences in the brains of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve brains from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> patients (group III) were examined and compared with those from five patients with non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disease</z:e> (group I) and five cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patients without significant WM lesions (group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was performed for glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin as astroglial cell markers, and for immunoglobulins, complements and fibrinogen as extravasated serum protein markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The grading scores for IgG extravasation were significantly higher in group III as compared to group I, in both the periventricular WM and the subcortical WM (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In group III, the scores in the periventricular WM and subcortical WM were significantly higher than in the subcortical U fibers and cerebral cortex (P &lt; 0.01 for the periventricular WM; P &lt; 0.001 for the subcortical WM), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clasmatodendritic astroglia, which had swollen cell bodies and large cytoplasmic vacuoles with disintegrated processes, incorporated the serum components IgG, IgM, C3d, Clq and fibrinogen, both in the periventricular WM and subcortical WM in 5 out of 12 (42%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that WM lesions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> are accompanied by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> dysfunction, although it remains uncertain whether <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> dysfunction is secondary to either <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> or arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
