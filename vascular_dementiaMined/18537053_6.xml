<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease is characterized by ultrastructural granular deposits within small arterial vessels and degeneration of vascular smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Yet, little is known about endothelial function in CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vasoreactivity induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi>, which is the substrate for endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase, is a parameter of endothelial function and has been shown to be altered in patients with cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To assess endothelial function in CADASIL, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi>-induced vasoreactivity was studied in 25 CADASIL subjects and 24 non-CADASIL control subjects without previous history of cerebrovascular disease by transcranial Doppler sonography of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Resting mean flow velocity was significantly reduced in patients (43.7 +/- 14.5 cm/s) compared to controls (57.0 +/- 10.4 cm/s) [p &lt; 0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients exhibited a significantly higher pulsatility index (PI = 0.94 +/- 0.19) than control subjects (PI = 0.79 +/- 0.11) [p &lt; 0.01] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi>-induced vasoreactivity was significantly increased in patients (36.1 +/- 15.5 % ) versus controls (27.9 +/- 8.5 %) [p &lt; 0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients, there was a significant reduction of the PI following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> application (PI = 0.86 +/- 0.13) compared to resting PI [p &lt; 0.01] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results may indicate a pathogenic role of impaired cerebral hemodynamics and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> in CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our finding of enhanced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> vasoreactivity might have therapeutic implications for CADASIL and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
