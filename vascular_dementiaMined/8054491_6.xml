<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ubiquitin (Ub) was determined by a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in serum (S) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 29 patients with 'probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>' (AD), 14 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VAD), and 13 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean concentration of Ub in CSF (110 +/- 20 ng/mL) was about 20% of that in serum (940 +/- 120 ng/mL) in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between S-Ub and CSF-Ub, or between the CSF/S.Ub ratio and the CSF/S albumin ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that a major portion of CSF-Ub is intrathecally produced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSF-Ub was increased while S-Ub was decreased in both AD and VAD patients as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, the CSF/S Ub ratio showed good discrimination between patients and controls: 22/29 (76%) of the AD patients and 9/14 (64%) of the VAD patients had a CSF/S Ub ratio that was higher than the highest control value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in any of the parameters were found between AD and VAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ub is involved in an ATP-dependent proteolytic pathway and also acts as a heatshock protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increase in CSF-Ub in AD and VAD may therefore be interpreted as a cytoprotective response to abnormal or damaged proteins, and CSF-Ub may have a potential as a non-disease-specific marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0007313'>cerebral degeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
