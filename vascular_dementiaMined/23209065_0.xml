<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Abstract&lt;br/&gt; In this review, we present an overview of clinical studies that addressed the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cross-sectional studies and meta-analyses have repeatedly shown an association between late-life <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (LLD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, particularly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; however, the findings of cohort studies have been inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, studies on the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> with a younger <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> have yielded inconsistent results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regarding <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> associated with LLD, several studies have reported an association between LLD and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, suggesting that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> itself can cause persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other studies have compared the cognitive profile between LLD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> with a younger <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, but their results have been inconclusive, especially regarding the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LLD is associated with vascular change and white matter degeneration of the brain, as shown by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recently, several studies reported an association between gray matter change and LLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Studies currently in progress employ functional brain imaging methods such as single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography, functional MRI, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography.&lt;br/&gt; Clinically, it is important to understand how subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> can be defined in terms of risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and to devise effective treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One paper explored the possibility of detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> associated with AD by measuring the blood Aβ40/Aβ42 levels, and other studies have suggested that symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0424091" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">loss of interest</z:e> are associated with conversion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> to AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, current antidepressants may have limited efficacy on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; therefore, further investigation for devising methods of predicting conversion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and subsequent treatment is required </plain></SENT>
