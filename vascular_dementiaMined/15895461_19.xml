<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently a polymorphism in the proinflammatory cytokine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF), in association with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (APOE), was reported to increase AD risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two SNPs, rs1799724 (-850C&gt;T; NT_007592.14:g.22400733C&gt;T) and rs1800629 (-308G&gt;A; [NT_007592.14:g.22401282G&gt;A]), and the APOE polymorphism were genotyped in 506 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> AD and in 277 cognitively healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a subset of 90 individuals we also investigated whether these SNPs exerted any functional effects on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) beta-amyloid (Abeta) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the rs1799724 genotypes and the rs1799724-T allele were significantly different in AD individuals (P=0.009; odds ratio [OR], 1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-2.34), while the rs1800629 SNP was not associated with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant interaction was observed between the rs1799724-T and APOE epsilon4 alleles in that the rs1799724-T allele significantly modified risk associated with possession of the epsilon4 allele only (epsilon4 in absence of rs1799724-T: OR, 2.92; 95% CI, 2.00-4.27; epsilon4 in presence of rs1799724-T: OR, 6.65; 95% CI, 3.26-13.55; P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Haplotyping analysis revealed a significant overrepresentation of an rs1799724-T/rs1800629-G haplotype in AD (P=0.012; OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.11-2.29), although to a lesser degree than rs1799724-T alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, the rs1799724-T allele was found to be associated with lower levels of CSF Abeta42 (P=0.023), thus corroborating the genetic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>Inheritance</z:hpo> of the rs1799724-T allele appears to synergistically increase the risk of AD in APOEepsilon4 carriers and is associated with altered CSF Abeta42 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further investigations are warranted to assess the significance of these novel findings </plain></SENT>
