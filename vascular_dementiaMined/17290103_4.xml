<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To measure the diagnostic competence of family physicians (FP) and neuropsychiatrists (NP) for moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Written case vignettes describing moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> either of Alzheimer type or vascular type were randomized to a representative sample of 122 FP and 68 NP, corresponding to response rates of 71.8 and 67.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They served as the basis for a structured face-to-face interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NP and FP did not differ with regard to their diagnostic considerations, however, concerning diagnostic workup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was much better recognized than <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological tests and brain imaging would be done by 14.8 and 32.8% of the FP in the case of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Alzheimer <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> they would apply these methods in 24.6 and 19.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The corresponding numbers for NP were about 60% in both cases for testing and more than 80% for brain imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is still a wide gap between guidelines and practice in primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The apparent overdiagnosis of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> may be one reason for the low drug treatment rates </plain></SENT>
