<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Twenty-four-hour blood pressure (BP) readings have been found to correlate with hypertensive target organ damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (LI) and white matter lesions (WML) probably represent manifestations of cerebral hypertensive target organ damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to better delineate the relationships between 24-hour BP measurements, LI/WML and small vessel disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>/vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (CI/VD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred patients with first-time symptomatic LI were examined with 24-hour BP monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The degree of nocturnal BP dip, (daytime BP - nighttime BP)/daytime BP, was categorized into three groups: dippers (&gt;0.1), nondippers (0-0.1) and reverse dippers (&lt;0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>WML were subdivided into periventricular hyperintensities (PVH) and subcortical hyperintensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The breakdown of patients was: 50% nondippers, 27.5% reverse dippers and 22.5% dippers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-one patients (20.5%) were found to have CI and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Male sex (OR 3.35; 95% CI 1.20-9.34), advanced PVH (OR 14.42; 95% CI 5.62-36.98) and absence of a dipping status (nondipper: OR 12.62; 95% CI 1.37-115.95; reverse dipper: OR 11.95; 95% CI 1.27-112.11) were independently associated with CIVD after multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High nighttime systolic BP (OR 3.93; 95% CI 1.38-11.17), high daytime (OR 2.06; 95% CI 1.03-4.04) and nighttime diastolic BP (OR 2.48; 95% CI 1.13-5.45) and absence of a dipping status (nondipper: OR 2.7; 95% CI 1.03-7.05; reverse dipper: OR 3.78; 95% CI 1.38-10.34) were significantly associated with PVH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695689" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nondipping</z:e> status was found in the LI cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695689" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nondipping</z:e> status appears to be directly associated with CIVD independent of PVH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study indicates the need for further studies to investigate whether or not controlling nighttime BP will help reduce the risk for CI/VD development </plain></SENT>
