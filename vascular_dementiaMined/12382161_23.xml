<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To identify non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> due to a cerebrovascular etiology among those coming to observation of a memory clinic and to describe their clinical features and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were enrolled in a prospective study on early <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> carried out in a Memory Clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> of the vascular type (MCI-V) was defined based on modified criteria for subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>) by Erkinjuntti and colleagues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine patients with MCI-V (age 78 +/- 7, Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) 24 +/- 3) were compared with 14 with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> of degenerative etiology (MCI) based on the Mayo Clinic criteria (age 72 +/- 9, MMSE 25 +/- 2), and to 21 patients with frank <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> (age 80 +/- 6, MMSE 21 +/- 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed over time for 32 +/- 8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MCI-V patients had a neuropsychological profile characterized by poor performance on frontal tests (Wisconsin card sorting and word fluency) and neurological features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo> (impairment of balance and gait) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of those followed for at least 40 months, 50 % of patients with MCI-V and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> had died, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> MCI patients were still alive ( P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of those alive, 68 % of the MCI-V, 52 % of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>, and 17 % of the MCI patients had reached one of the following outcomes at 40 months: nursing home placement, functional loss, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e> ( P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MCI-V have a distinctive clinical picture and can be identified in a clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because of the high frequency of adverse outcomes, very early preventive measures need to be devised </plain></SENT>
