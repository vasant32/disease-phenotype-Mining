<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is one of several constructional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002186'>apraxia</z:hpo> observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, particularly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of it in the differential diagnosis of AD and subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>) and to clarify the factors associated with it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We operationally defined and classified it into three types, namely overlap, adherent, and near type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the incidence of it in patients with AD (n = 98) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> (n = 48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AD patients exhibited a significantly higher occurrence of it as compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the different types of it, the overlap and adherent types occurred almost exclusively in AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A discriminant analysis in AD subjects revealed that the scores obtained from the MMSE, CDR, Barthel index, and the Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test were correlated significantly with the occurrence of it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference between the Q-EEG parameters of patients that exhibited the closing-in phenomenon and those that did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the closing-in phenomenon is phase- and AD-specific and might be a useful tool for the differential diagnosis of AD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
