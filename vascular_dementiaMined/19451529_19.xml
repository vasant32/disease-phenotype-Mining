<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and its subtypes in late life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants were members of the Kame Project, a population-based prospective cohort study of 1,836 Japanese Americans living in King County, WA, who had a mean age of 71.8 years and were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-free at baseline (1992-1994), and were followed for incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> through 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD), and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) controlling for demographic and lifestyle characteristics and vascular comorbidities as a function of baseline BMI, WC, and WHR and change in BMI over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Higher baseline BMI was significantly associated with a reduced risk of AD (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.33-0.97) in the fully adjusted model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Slower rate of decline in BMI was associated with a reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (HR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.14-0.98), with the association stronger for those who were overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (HR = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.05-0.58) compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or underweight (HR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.18-5.66) at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Higher baseline body mass index (BMI) and slower declining BMI in late life are associated with a reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, suggesting that low BMI or a faster decline in BMI in late life may be preclinical indicators of an underlying dementing illness, especially for those who were initially overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
