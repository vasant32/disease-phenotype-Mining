<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A polymorphism in the cystatin C (CST3) gene was suggested to associate with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we attempted to determine the association between CST3 polymorphism and AD or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), and whether such effects are dependent of the APOE4 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The polymorphisms of CST3 genotype were determined using polymerase chain reactions (PCR) followed by gel electrophoresis in 124 AD, 70 VD, and 115 control individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No statistical difference in CST3B allele frequencies was observed among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Associations between CST3B/B genotype and AD patients older than 75-year-old, or VD patients younger than 75-year-old were evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The APOE4 allele alone significantly increased the odds for the developing AD, but not VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A logistic regression analysis revealed that either CST3 or its interaction with APOE4 were not significant predictors of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, a synergistic association of CST3 and APOE4 alleles was observed in predicting VD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that CST3 might interact with APOE4 on conferring vascular pathologies </plain></SENT>
