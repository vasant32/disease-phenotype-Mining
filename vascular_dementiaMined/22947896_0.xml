<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Should diagnostic errors occur, they most likely involve one of the other primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>, mixed pathologies that include a vascular component, or uncertainties that are associated with early diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) is overdiagnosed when a routine brain MRI or CT scan is used in the context of standard clinical diagnostic criteria, meanwhile denying significant neurodegenerative co-pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A promising approach for increasing diagnostic accuracy is the use of biochemical markers (biomarkers) that are present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CSF biomarkers ß-amyloid protein of 42 amino acids (Aß(1-42)), total tau protein (T-tau), and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (P-tau(181P)) are well validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A combined analysis of these biomarkers is of help to discriminate AD from non-AD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> (including VaD), reaching sensitivity and specificity levels that exceed 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the added value of CSF biomarkers could lie within those cases in which the clinical diagnostic work-up is not able to discriminate between AD or a non-AD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In case of doubt between VaD or mixed AD-VaD pathology in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients, the determination of CSF Aß(1-42), T-tau and P-tau(181P) levels is of help to confirm or exclude the AD component in the pathophysiology of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
