<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the relation between education and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> prevalence by computing the odds ratios (ORs) for different educational levels after adjustment for age, gender, occupational level, and life habits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A two-phase community study including 495 elderly subjects with middle to high socioeconomic status, aged more than 60 years and with a high percentage of noneducated subjects, was carried out in the province of Ravenna, Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> type were clinically diagnosed using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was observed among noneducated subjects of both genders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparing no education with any education, the OR (adjusted for age, gender, and occupation) was 4.7 (95% CI = 2.3 to 9.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association, although present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups, was extraordinarily strong among the youngest subjects (61 to 69 years) (OR = 139.5, 95% CI = 6.4 to 3,024.6) and decreased with increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Life habits, such as smoking and alcohol consumption as well as current or previous history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, did not change the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> prevalence among less well-educated (up to 3 years of education) and better-educated subjects (more than 3 years of schooling) after age and gender were taken into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar findings were found for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Having no education is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> independent of gender, occupation, life habits, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This association was stronger among younger old persons, and decreased with increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that the first decade of life is a critical period for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> later in life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> risk may be due to schooling, according to the cerebral reserve hypothesis, or to other factors associated with a higher educational level during childhood </plain></SENT>
