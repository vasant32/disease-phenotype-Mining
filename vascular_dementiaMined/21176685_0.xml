<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A sample of 2788 elderly residents from Beijing were investigated regarding the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> which was diagnosed using two-stage method in 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first stage, questionnaire was filled, including MMSE checked up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the second stage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the elderly who had lower MMSE score and some with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MMSE score were examined by neurologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was set up by two neurologists according to the criteria of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R and NINCDS-ADRDA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The same sample was followed up on 2000 and 2004 by the same way, with the overall time for following-up as 7.25 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 171 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> cases were diagnosed among the 2788 elderly in 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the end of the survey, another 180 new cases developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average weighted incidence was 0.84/100 person year, adjusted by age (it's same followed), with 0.64/100 person year in males and 1.01/100 person years in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 0.35/100 person years, with male as 0.39/100 person year and female as 0.32/100 person years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was increasing with age, but decreasing with time of education by Multinomial Logistic Regression Analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Old age and illiterate appeared to be the risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>People with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> history and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004421'>elevated systolic blood pressure</z:hpo> were risk factors for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the elderly in Beijing was higher than in other areas of China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Old age and illiterate were risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Being male, illiterate, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> history and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004421'>elevated systolic blood pressure</z:hpo> were risk factors for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
