<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A hospital-based cohort of African American patients in the Chicago area with AD, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (SWD) were followed for up to 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe and analyze predictors of survival in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Proportional hazards regression models were used to analyze risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 113 patients with AD (53 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>), 79 patients with VaD (31 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>), and 56 patients with SWD (14 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with AD who were older and had more years of education and lower Barthel ADL scores were at higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with VaD who were taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medication were at higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>; those who were taking aspirin or antiplatelet/<z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> medication were at lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>; and higher diastolic blood pressure was protective against <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the SWD group were older age, having ever been a smoker, and history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differences in survival across the three groups were not significant after adjusting for age and clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results in patients with VaD support the use of antiplatelet therapy for persons with VaD and suggest that optimal blood pressure may be higher in cognitively compromised poststroke patients than persons in the general population </plain></SENT>
