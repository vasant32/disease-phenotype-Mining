<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>HEALTH ISSUES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) increases exponentially with age from the age of 65 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The number of people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> will increase significantly over the next three decades as the population ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While prevalence and incidence rates do not differ markedly in women, compared to men, women live longer on average, so the number of women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is greater than for men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also, women are more frequently caregivers for people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is an important health problem for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: The Canadian Study of Health and Aging showed an increase in prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with age for both sexes, approximately doubling every five years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rates of AD were higher in women whereas rates of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were higher in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk of AD increased with increasing age, lower education, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E epsilon4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regular physical activity was clearly protective in women; this was less clear for men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi>, wine consumption, and past exposure to vaccines decreased the risk of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">Estrogen</z:chebi> replacement therapy did not reduce the risk of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>About three quarters of caregivers for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DATA GAPS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: The protective effect of regular physical activity for AD provides an additional reason to promote regular physical activity at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ongoing surveillance of the incidence, prevalence and risks for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is needed to monitor the impact of treatments as well as the aging of the population on the burden of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
