<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The cognitive significance of MRI white matter and other subcortical abnormalities in AD is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prior studies comparing AD patients with white matter changes on MRI have not included IVD patients with comparable MRI findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If white matter/subcortical changes in AD reflect <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo>, they might be associated with cognitive profiles similar to those seen in subcortical IVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We studied 15 AD patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subcortical MRIs, 22 AD patients with subcortical MRI hyperintensities, and 18 IVD (NINCDS-ADRDA and NINDS-AIREN criteria) at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Research Center of the Baylor College of Medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IVD patients had predominantly small and subcortical signal abnormalities, and none had large cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AD patients had only nonspecific subcortical signal abnormalities with or without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was not analyzed) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We compared the AD group with abnormal MRIs to the AD group with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subcortical MRIs and the AD group to the IVD group using ANCOVA planned comparisons (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity and education covaried) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AD patients with abnormal MRIs did not differ significantly from AD patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subcortical MRIs on any of the neuropsychological measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AD patients exhibited significantly better attention/concentration, visuospatial/visuoconstructional performance, letter fluency, motor programming, and simple motor speed than IVD patients as well as significantly worse delayed verbal recognition memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because MRI changes were generally more extensive in IVD, a subset of AD patients with abnormal subcortical MRIs was compared to a subset of IVD patients matched for degree of MRI signal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These subsets of AD and IVD patients still showed distinctive neuropsychological profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AD patients with or without MRI subcortical signal abnormalities have similar neuropsychological profiles, and they differ from IVD patients with comparable MRI changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although MRI signal abnormalities in AD patients who have no history or examination findings of cerebrovascular disease overlap with those seen in IVD patients, they do not seem to have the same cognitive significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Periventricular hyperintensities (PVHs) and deep signal hyperintensities, especially those of a mild to moderate degree, may reflect a different pathophysiologic process in AD than in IVD and do not necessarily have cognitive consequences in AD patients </plain></SENT>
