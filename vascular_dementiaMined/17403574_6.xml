<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we compared the capillary beds in AD and BD brains, using a modified Gallyas silver impregnation method and immunohistochemistry for beta amyloid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight autopsied brains with AD and seven with BD were compared with six control brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cortical microvessels in AD were frequently narrowed, and torn off, especially in close proximity to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>senile plaques</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The capillary densities in AD were significantly decreased as compared with the control brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there were no significant changes in the capillary densities and their <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphologies</z:mp> in BD brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry for beta amyloid revealed numerous deposits in the vascular wall and perivascular neuropil exclusively in AD brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cortical microvascular changes in AD and their absence in BD may indicate a role of beta amyloid for the microvessel pathology in AD </plain></SENT>
