<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) is a challenging illness that affects the lives of older adults and caregivers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unclear how multiple vascular risk factor exposures (polyvascular disease) affect VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the relationship between multiple vascular risk exposures, as counted on an index in cases with VaD, compared with healthy age-/gender-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a matched case-control study of subjects living in Olmsted County, MN with documented VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Controls were selected by gender and age within 3 years from those who did not have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The exposures included a total index (eleven exposure factors) added together, along with indexes for cerebrovascular disease (two exposures), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (four exposures), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> (three exposures), and lifestyle (two exposures) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis used matched conditional univariable logistic regression for each index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1736 potential subjects were identified, and 205 subjects were diagnosed with VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant association of the total score index with an odds ratio of 1.45 (95% confidence interval 1.21-1.74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cerebrovascular index was also associated with VaD with an odds ratio of 12.18 (95% confidence interval 6.29-23.61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cardiovascular and vascular indexes were also associated with VaD status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The lifestyle index was not associated with VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The cumulative role of multiple vascular risk factors or diseases increased the risk of VaD, as noted by the total vascular index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The lifestyle index did not reveal any significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further work is required for evaluation of these indexes </plain></SENT>
