<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate prevalence, incidence, and rate of progression of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and correlated vascular risk factors with incident MCI and its progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors evaluated 2,963 individuals from the population-based sample of 5,632 subjects 65 to 84 years old, at the first (1992 to 1993) and second survey (1995 to 1996) of the Italian Longitudinal Study on Aging (ILSA), with a 3.5-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and MCI were classified using current clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 2,963 participants, 139 MCI patients were diagnosed at the first ILSA survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the 3.5-year follow-up, 113 new events of MCI were diagnosed with an estimated incidence rate of 21.5 per 1,000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found a progression rate to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes) of 3.8/100 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specific progression rates for AD, VaD, and other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were 2.3, 1.3, and 0.3/100 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, age was a risk factor for incident MCI (RR: 5.93, 95% CI: 3.17 to 11.10), while education was protective (RR: 0.06, 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.10), and serum total cholesterol evidenced a borderline nonsignificant trend for a protective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a nonsignificant trend for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as a risk factor of progression of MCI to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this population, among those who progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 60% progressed to AD and 33% to VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Vascular risk factors influence incident mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and the rate of progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
