<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors compared the therapeutic effect of morning bright and dim light exposure on rest-activity (R-A) rhythm disorders in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer's type (DAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Participants in this study were 12 patients with VD (M/F = 5/7; average age = 81 years) and 10 patients with DAT (M/F = 4/6; average age = 78 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were exposed to 2 weeks of bright light (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>; 5000-8000 lux) and 2 weeks of dim light (DL; 300 lux) in the morning (09:00-11:00) in a randomized crossover design in which the 2-week treatment period took place between pretreatment (1 week) and posttreatment (1 week) periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Continuous R-A monitoring was performed at 1-minute intervals throughout the study using an actigraph around the nondominant wrist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> exposure for 2 weeks induced a significant reduction in both nighttime activity and percentages of nighttime activity to total activity compared with the pretreatment period, as well as compared with the DL condition in the VD group, but not in the DAT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings support the assumption that the therapeutic efficacies of morning <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> exposure are prominent in VD patients and are mainly due to its photic effect rather than nonphotic effects such as the intensification of social interaction accompanying light therapy </plain></SENT>
