<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MTHFR is a key enzyme in the metabolism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> and elevated levels of that amino acid have been associated to Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A T--&gt;C transition at codon 677 produces a thermolabile type of the enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, contrasting results on the distribution of the MTHFR C677T common polymorphism in AD have been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the distribution of the MTHFR and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (APOE) polymorphisms in Italian patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the C677T polymorphism did not differ in AD and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the MTHFR polymorphism does not contribute to genetic susceptibility in Italian <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> AD and does not mitigate the effect of ApoE epsilon4 allele on AD risk </plain></SENT>
