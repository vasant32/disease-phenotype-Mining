<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight eligible studies were included in this review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pooled prevalence for the population aged 60 years and older of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) was 1.9%, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) was 0.9%, and total <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 3.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of VaD was significantly higher in Northern China than in Southern China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of VaD was significantly higher in urban compared to rural areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and prevalence of AD increased with age in both males and females, and a higher prevalence of AD than VaD was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AD has become more common than VaD in China since 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The current prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in China may be similar to that of developed countries </plain></SENT>
