<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It acts on nicotinic and muscarinic receptors to mediate complex functions, such as attention, memory, cognition, and consciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Degeneration of cholinergic neurons has been observed in several <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative disease</z:hpo>, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>), but not in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is the enzyme that terminates cholinergic actions through the rapid hydrolysis of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AChE is localized on both cholinergic and cholinoceptive neurons in the brain with the highest activity in the striatum, followed by the cerebellum, thalamus, and cerebral cortex (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AChE has been a target for radioligand development as well as drug development because its levels decrease in AD (1, 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For measurements of AChE activity, various labeled <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">esters</z:chebi> of 1-methy-4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48590">hydroxypiperidine</z:chebi> have been designed and evaluated as <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> substrate analogs (3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two of them, N-[<z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>]methylpiperidin-4-yl <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> ([<z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>]MP4A) and 1-[<z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>]methylpiperidin-4-yl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17272">propionate</z:chebi> ([<z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMP</z:chebi>), were chosen for further development as radioligands for use in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Each has a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32876">tertiary amine</z:chebi> structure that makes it lipophilic; thus, it readily crosses the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>[<z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMP</z:chebi> is specifically hydrolyzed by AChE (86-95% specificity) and yields a hydrophilic metabolite, N-[<z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>]methylpiperidinol ([<z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>]MP4OH), which is trapped in the brain because it cannot cross the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The hydrolysis rate of MP4P is 3- to 4-fold slower than that of MP4A in rat and human brain homogenates (1), thus allowing more precise estimates of AChE activity in regions of moderate to high AChE levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>[<z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMP</z:chebi> is being developed as a PET agent for the non-invasive study of brain AChE activity in patients with AD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
