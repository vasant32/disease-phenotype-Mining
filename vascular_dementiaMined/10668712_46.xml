<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the importance of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and its three subgroups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; and AD with a vascular component) to the prevalence and burden of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in elderly people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Vascular lesions may produce a spectrum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1392786" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive changes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Omitting elderly patients whose <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> short of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) may give a falsely low indication of the prevalence and burden of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test this proposition, we compared the rates of adverse outcomes for patients with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (and its subgroups), and probable AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Canadian Study of Health and Aging is a prospective cohort study of 10,253 randomly selected community-dwelling and institution-dwelling respondents aged 65 years or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the community, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants (n = 9,008) were screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>; those who screened positive and a sample of those who screened negative received a clinical assessment (n = 1,659) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients living in institutions received a clinical assessment (n = 1,255) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Participants were reassessed 5 years after the original survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was the most prevalent form of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> among those aged 65 to 84 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rates of institutionalization and mortality for those with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> were significantly higher than those of people who had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, and the mortality rate for patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> was similar to that of patients with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Failure to consider vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> underestimates the prevalence of impairment and the risk for adverse outcomes associated with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
