<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Clinically electroacupuncture (EA) is proved an effective therapy for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), but their mechanisms remain uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether EA protects pyramidal cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in hippocampus of a VD rat model by inhibiting the expression of p53 and Noxa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One month after a VD animal model was established by bilateral occlusion of common carotid arteries, EA treatment was given at "Baihui" (DU20), "Dazhui" (DU14), and "Shenshu" (BL23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The learning and memory ability was assessed by <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in hippocampus was evaluated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin (HE) staining, and the expression of p53 and Noxa was analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscope with immunofluorescence staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Expressions of p53 and Noxa in the EA group and sham-operated group were less than in the VD model group (P &lt; 0.01), and the expression of p53 was positively correlated to expression of Noxa in hippocampus of VD rats (r = 0.918, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EA treatment could reduce the amount of apoptotic neurons in hippocampal CA1 area of rats with VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average latency in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> test was significantly shorter, and escape strategies improved from edge and random searches to more linear swim pathway in the EA group compared with the VD model group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The increasing expressions of p53 and Noxa play important roles in the pathogenesis of VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EA improves learning and memory ability and protects pyramidal cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by blocking expression of p53 and Noxa in the hippocampal CA1 region of VD rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a novel mechanism of EA treatment to VD </plain></SENT>
