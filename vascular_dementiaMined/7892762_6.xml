<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We documented the neuropsychological changes one to three weeks and three months post <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in 25 unselected patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, first cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Improvements were seen in processes through to have a large subcortical component and in those mediated in the right hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Memory was relatively lightly affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The minimal deficits seen in memory and the predominance of subcortical changes are at variance with the currently suggested criteria for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further data of this kind are needed before firm criteria can be proposed for the global pattern of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1392786" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive changes</z:e> expected in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
