<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several new techniques have been used for differentiation of various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among these techniques 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) uptake was reported to have benefit in distinguishing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> from AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors study the role of MIBG as a tool for differentiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>, AD and VAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were recruited to the study by DSMIIIR criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of each <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> type was made by standard clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain imagings and 131I-MIBG uptake were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the studied patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>, 3 AD and 3 VAD patients were clinically diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The heart/mediastinum (H/M) ratio in 4 out of 5 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> was significantly lower than H/M ratio in patients with AD and VAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AD patients had the highest uptake of MIBG MIBG uptake of VAD patients was in the range between AD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> but the values were close to the AD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 131I-MIBG is helpful in differentiating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> from AD </plain></SENT>
