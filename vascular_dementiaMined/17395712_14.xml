<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the xMAP technology has been introduced as an alternative to ELISA for measurement of these markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used xMAP assays and ELISA to analyze CSF concentrations of Abeta(42), total tau (t-tau), and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau(181)) in samples from 69 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, 26 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 55 controls without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High CV values (&gt;28%) for the ratio of xMAP:ELISA were observed for each biomarker, indicating that a constant correction factor cannot be applied to recalculate xMAP results into ELISA results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When a combination of CSF markers was used, the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curves for xMAP assays and ELISAs were not significantly different in differentiating AD patients from vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A constant conversion factor cannot be used successfully to recalculate results obtained with xMAP assays to those from the ELISAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With the use of analysis of a combination of Abeta(42), t-tau, and p-tau in CSF, however, differentiation of clinical groups is equivalent when either xMAP technology or conventional ELISA is used </plain></SENT>
