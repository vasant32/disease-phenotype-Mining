<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A study population of 1,118 Korean elders was randomly sampled from the residents aged 65 years or older living in Seongnam, Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Standardized face-to-face interviews, and neurological and physical examinations were conducted on 714 respondents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was diagnosed according to the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV diagnostic criteria, and its subtypes were determined according to the criteria of the NINCDS-ADRDA, the NINDS-AIREN, and the consensus guideline proposed by McKeith et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>[Neurology 1996;47:1113-1124] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The estimated age- and gender-standardized prevalences were 6.3% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (95% CI = 4.5-8.1), 4.8% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD; 95% CI = 3.3-6.4), 1.0% for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD; 95% CI = 0.3-1.8), and 0.4% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>; 95% CI = 0.0-0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of AD consistently increased with age, whereas that of VD peaked at age 75-79 years and decreased thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients, 72.0% were in the very mild or mild stages of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in a typical urban area of Korea was estimated to be 6.3%, and AD was the most prevalent subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> was less prevalent than VD among these community-dwelling Korean elders </plain></SENT>
