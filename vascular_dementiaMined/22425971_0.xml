<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) failed to discover any nucleotide sequence variant associated with susceptibility to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) and remained a problem of false negatives produced by a low statistical power </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study was conducted to identify such potential false negatives and to provide comprehensive evidence for the most plausible predisposing genetic factor using large-scale Korean cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified the gene encoding <z:hpo ids='HP_0000510'>retinitis pigmentosa</z:hpo> GTPase regulator-interacting protein 1-like (RPGRIP1L) with multiple nucleotide variants associated with susceptibility to VaD by a modest significant threshold (P&lt;10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genetic associations were intensively examined with its sequence variants using 207 VaD patients and 207 age- and gender-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genetic association analysis with dense variants in the region associated with VaD revealed 3 variants (P&lt;0.0017) in strong linkage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further analysis with VaD-related phenotypes using Korean Association REsource (KARE) cohort data showed that the region of the gene was associated with alanine aminotransferase (ALT), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> aminotransferase (AST), and blood pressure (BP) (P&lt;7.6Ã—10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The current study provided the first evidence of the association between RPGRIP1L gene and susceptibility of VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Functional studies are needed to understand underlying biological mechanism of the genetic association </plain></SENT>
