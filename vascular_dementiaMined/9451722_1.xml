<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>17 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) representing moderate to severe stage of the disease and 11 age-matched control subjects were examined with spectral analysis of EEG and a neuropsychological test battery comprising visual, praxic, verbal and memory functions as well as Mini-Mental Status test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>VaD patients did not have less activity in the alpha band than control subjects, but the alpha amplitude ratio between eyes closed (EC) and eyes open (EO) situations (EC/EO ratio) was decreased in VaD patients, compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In VaD the variables of the awake background EEG with eyes closed (amplitude of alpha, beta, theta and delta activity; mean frequency) had only a few correlations to neuropsychological test scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the (EC)/(EO) alpha ratio showed significant correlations with several neuropsychological variables in the temporo-occipital and centro-parietal derivations and some of these correlations were lateralized to the left or right hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Frontal EEG derivations with less alpha activity did not reveal any correlations to neuropsychological variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the dynamic EC/EO alpha ratio variable may be even more sensitive in the assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain dysfunction</z:e> in VaD than the background EEG variables </plain></SENT>
