<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there has been no evaluation of the cerebellar volume in the preclinical stage of SVaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to compare cerebellar volume among patients with amnestic mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (aMCI) and subcortical vascular mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (svMCI) and evaluate which factors could have contributed to the cerebellar volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were composed of 355 patients with aMCI, svMCI, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), and SVaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebellar volumes were measured using automated methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A direct comparison of the cerebellar volume in SVaD and AD groups showed that the SVaD group had a statistically smaller cerebellar volume than the AD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the svMCI group had a smaller cerebellar volume than the aMCI group, with the number of lacunes (especially in the supratentorial regions) being associated with cerebellar volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebellar volumes were associated with some neuropsychological tests, digit span backward and ideomotor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002186'>apraxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001272'>cerebellar atrophy</z:hpo> may be useful in differentiating subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and the cerebellum plays a potential role in cognition </plain></SENT>
