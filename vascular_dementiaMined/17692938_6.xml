<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Determining the clinical characteristics, risk factors, and indices of cognitive reserve would help in achieving this goal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors for AD and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) in the elderly and to highlight the importance of risk factor modification in the early diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consecutive 1436 patients (mean age=72.7+/-6.9 years, 34.2% male) were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a comprehensive geriatric and cognitive assessment, patients were grouped as AD group (n=203), VD group (n=73) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognitive status (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>) group (n=1160) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three possibly related factors including demographic characteristics, co-existing diseases and laboratory parameters were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results revealed that female sex, advanced age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and intake of vitamin supplements were independent related factors for AD; whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>) were independent related factors for VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For every geriatric patient admitted for any reason, cognitive assessment should be performed, risk factors should be determined and the patients at high risk should be followed up carefully </plain></SENT>
