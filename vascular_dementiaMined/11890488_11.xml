<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> types in a community sample of Hispanics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This is a descriptive diagnostic study of a nonrandom community outreach sample utilizing established criteria for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recruitment involved direct community outreach with diagnostic evaluations conducted at a university-affiliated outpatient clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Hispanic Neuropsychiatric and Memory Research Clinic at the Olive View-UCLA Medical Center in Sylmar, California </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: One hundred community-dwelling Hispanics age 55 and older without prior diagnosis or treatment of their cognitive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Each subject underwent a complete medical diagnostic evaluation, in Spanish, including neuropsychological tests, neurological examination, laboratory tests, and brain imaging (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) to establish <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was established according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e>, Fourth Edition (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis for probable or possible AD and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VascD) was established using criteria from the National Institute of Neurological and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009460" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Communicative Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> and Related Disorders Association for probable AD and by research criteria from the National Institute of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> and the Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences for VascD, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>Frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> was diagnosed using recommendations set forth by the Lund and Manchester groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects were poor, with low acculturation levels despite long years of U.S. residence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Forty percent of subjects had had undiagnosed cognitive symptoms for 3 or more years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of those <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e>, 38.5% had AD and 38.5% met criteria for VascD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The best predictors of VascD were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and cerebrovascular disease, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E4 allele best predicted AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Other forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were also present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Twenty percent of the sample was clinically depressed but not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with data from predominantly white populations, our proportion of AD cases was lower and that of VascD cases was considerably higher than anticipated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The percentage of clinically depressed older individuals was also high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These findings could have implications for differential cultural and genetic risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> among diverse ethnic/racial groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to obtain accurate prevalence estimates of dementing disorders among the different U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Hispanic populations </plain></SENT>
