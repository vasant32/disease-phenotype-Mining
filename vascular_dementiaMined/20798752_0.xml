<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied a Venezuelan population that has high prevalence of both elevated tHcy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypotheses that (1) elevated tHcy is associated with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> risk, (2) the risk is greater for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) than for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), and (3) a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may partly explain this association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2100 participants (&gt;/=55 years old) of the Maracaibo Aging Study underwent standardized neurological, neuropsychiatric, and cardiovascular assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elevated tHcy was significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, primarily VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and other confounding factors were taken into account, elevated tHcy remained a significant risk factor in older (&gt;66 years), but not in younger (55-66 years) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ongoing studies of this population may provide insight into the mechanism by which tHcy increases risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
