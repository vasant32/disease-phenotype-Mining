<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of physical activity on neuropsychiatric disturbances in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients and on the mental burden of their caregivers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Assisted by a public geriatric psychiatry clinical unit, we studied 59 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into three groups according to their diagnosis and level of physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were assessed through a semi-structured interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, the Mini-Sleep Questionnaire and the Baecke Questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data were statistically analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test and linear regression, with the level of significance set at 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with Alzheimer's or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> who engaged in physical activity had fewer neuropsychiatric symptoms than those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When compared to the control group, the caregivers of patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> who engaged in physical activity had a reduced burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The regular practice of physical activity seems to contribute to a reduction in neuropsychiatric symptoms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients and to attenuate the burden of the caregivers of those patients </plain></SENT>
