<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These histological findings were matched in two cases by biochemical measurements of loss of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> brain regions examined, ranging from 10 per cent in temporal cortex to 53 per cent in hypothalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By contrast, neither nucleolar volume nor cytoplasmic <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was altered in cells of the substantia nigra, nor was <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> content significantly altered in most regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> neither <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> nor <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> metabolism was changed except in regions of local circulatory deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings provide evidence of a primary degeneration of the noradrenergic system in Alzheimer type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
