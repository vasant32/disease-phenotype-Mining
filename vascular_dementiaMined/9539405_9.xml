<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was based on longitudinal data from a case-control study of 668 individuals aged 75 and older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The elderly were examined extensively by physicians, and family interviews were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> diagnosis was made by using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individuals with a history of continuous use of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepines</z:chebi> (BDZ+) were compared with nonusers (BDZ-), with respect to the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at follow-up 3 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was found that there was a significantly lower incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> in the BDZ+ group than in the BDZ- group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This negative association remained significant when controlling for age, gender, level of education, use of nonsteriodal <z:chebi fb="3" ids="35472">antiinflammatory drugs</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepines</z:chebi> may have protective effects against the disease </plain></SENT>
