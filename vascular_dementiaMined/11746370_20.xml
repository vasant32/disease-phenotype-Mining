<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), nine patients with subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>), and 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of WMC was evaluated by a neuroradiologist using the Blennow-Wallin scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven subjects had no or only punctate WMC; 14 had moderate to severe WMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both diagnostic group and WMC, but not gender or apolipoproteinE E4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo>, contributed to the variance in the CSF levels of tau, NFL, and Abeta42 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with moderate to severe WMC, CSF NFL (P &lt; 0.01), but not CSF tau or CSF Abeta42, was increased also after correction for age, gender, and degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A comparison between patients and controls with any signs of WMC and those without such signs yielded a similar result: CSF NFL (P &lt; 0.001) was increased in the group with signs of WMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As in numerous previous studies, we found that CSF tau was increased in AD (P &lt; 0.001) compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, CSF NFL was increased in both AD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> compared with controls (P &lt; 0.001 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although diagnostic group seems to be a stronger predictor of the variance found in CSF NFL, a clear association between the presence of WMC and increased CSF NFL was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because NFL is located mainly in large myelinated axons, increased CSF NFL in individuals with WMC probably reflects <z:mp ids='MP_0005405'>axonal degeneration</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
