<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to evaluate if <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>-dependent changes of the hippocampus of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) of different ages were related with those occurring in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hippocampus was chosen as the brain area involved in learning and memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Systolic pressure was slightly increased in 2-month-old SHR in comparison with age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and augmented progressively with age in SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No microanatomical changes were observed in the hippocampus of SHR of 2 months in comparison with age-matched WKY rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A limited decrease of white matter volume was observed in 4-month-old SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In SHR of 6 months, a reduction of grey matter volume both in the CA1 subfield and in the dentate gyrus occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of phosphorylated 200-kDa neurofilament immunoreactivity revealed a decreased immune reaction area in the CA1 subfield of 6-month-old SHR compared to age-matched WKY rats and no changes in the expression and localization of the dendritic marker microtubule associated protein (MAP)-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 6-month-old SHR, an increase of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-expression was found by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry revealed an increase in number (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>), but not in size of astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate the occurrence of cytoskeletal breakdown and astroglial changes primarily in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus of SHR of 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The occurrence in the hippocampus of SHR of regressive changes and astroglial reaction similar to those occurring in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> suggests that they represent an animal model of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
