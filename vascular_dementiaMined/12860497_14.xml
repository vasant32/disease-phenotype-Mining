<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Galantamine, an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38462">acetylcholinesterase inhibitor</z:chebi> and allosteric nicotinic modulator, has shown broad clinical benefits in patients with mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> due to AD, probable VaD, or AD with cerebrovascular disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>)-so-called mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety profiles of galantamine 24 mg/d in patients with VaD or AD with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> over the longer term (&gt;6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was an open-label extension of a 6-month double-blind study of galantamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who had been randomized to receive galantamine 24 mg/d or placebo in the double-blind phase were eligible to continue open-label treatment with galantamine 24 mg/d for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy end point was change in cognition, based on scores on the 11-item <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog/11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondary measures included changes in functional ability (as measured on the Disability Assessment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> [DAD]) and behavior (as measured on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory [NPI]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Safety and tolerability were also monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four hundred fifty-nine patients (240 men, 219 women; mean [SE] age, 75.2 [0.33] years) entered the open-label phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 195 (42.5%) had a diagnosis of probable VaD, and 238 (51.9%) had a diagnosis of AD with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>; the remainder had an inconclusive diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At month 12 of the study, improvements from baseline (the start of the double-blind phase) in ADAS-cog/11 scores were observed in both the group that received placebo during the double-blind phase (placebo/galantamine group: -0.3 point; 95% CI, -1.64 to 1.06) and the group that received galantamine during the double-blind phase (galantamine/galantamine group: -0.9 point; 95% CI, -1.73 to 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Improvement in functional ability was demonstrated by statistically significant mean (SE) changes from baseline in DAD score in both the placebo/galantamine group (-7.4 [1.68]; P &lt; or = 0.001) and the galantamine/galantamine group (-3.6 [1.33]; P &lt; or = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no significant change in mean (SE) NPI scores in either group (0.2 [0.98] and 0.1 [0.70], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Galantamine treatment was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In these patients with VaD and AD with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, galantamine treatment produced similar sustained benefits in terms of maintenance of or improvement in cognition (ADAS-cog/11), functional ability (DAD), and behavior (NPI) after 12 months </plain></SENT>
