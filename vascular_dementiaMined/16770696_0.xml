<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is growing consensus in the literature that oxidation status is increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), and that <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> supplementation as prevention or treatment strategy should be investigated further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study the total <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> status (TAS) was found to be highly significantly lower in 22 AD patients (p &lt; 0.0001) than in 22 age- and gender matched non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The TAS was also lower than controls in 22 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, but not significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The increased oxidation status in AD was verified using the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16150">benzoate</z:chebi> hydroxylation method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The origin of the enhanced oxidation status in AD has not been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine whether a causal effect between stress and oxidative status of serum can be demonstrated, a rat model was used with two different kinds of stressors, swim stress (exercise) and restraint stress (non-exercise stress) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following swim stress the maximum oxidative effect was observed at one hour post stress (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 24 h the oxidative status had recovered significantly to below control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Restraint stress, however, showed progressively increased oxidation which attained significance after 24 h (p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is postulated that stress may contribute to the higher oxidation status in AD patients </plain></SENT>
