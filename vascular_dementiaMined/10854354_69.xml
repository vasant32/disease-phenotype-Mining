<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using studies conducted in the 1990s, the authors compare the age- and sex-specific prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, AD, and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) across European population-based studies of persons 65 years and older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data from these studies were also pooled to obtain stable estimates of age- and sex-specific prevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 2346 cases of mild to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were identified in 11 cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age-standardized prevalence was 6.4% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes), 4.4% for AD, and 1.6% for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> increased continuously with age and was 0.8% in the group age 65 to 69 years and 28.5% at age 90 years and older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The corresponding figures for AD (53.7% of cases) were 0.6% and 22.2%, and for VaD (15.8% of cases), 0.3% and 5.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Variation of AD prevalence across studies was greatest for men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the VaD subtype, a large variation across studies was observed, as well as a difference in prevalence between men and women that was age dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> is more prevalent in women, and AD is the main contributor to the steep increase of prevalence with age </plain></SENT>
