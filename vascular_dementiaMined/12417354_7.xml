<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To compare the costs of VaD to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and controls without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study samples were drawn from community-dwelling patients in a large Medicare managed care organization (MCO) operating in the Northeast region of the USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Costs for three study groups were contrasted in the study: 240 cases with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), 1,366 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), and 19,300 controls without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Costs were estimated from medical and pharmacy claims data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Estimated cost differences are controlled for age, gender, and comorbid conditions using regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VaD patients accounted for 6% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients identified in the health plan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>VaD patients had substantially higher prevalence rates for 10 cardiovascular conditions compared with AD patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Annual costs for VaD patients were US$6,797 greater than AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with controls, costs were US$10,545 higher for VaD patients and US$3,748 higher for AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Higher costs for VaD and AD patients relative to controls were largely attributable to higher inpatient costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Annual medical costs for VaD patients were substantially higher than costs for patients with AD and control patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The high cost of VaD patients suggests a need to improve medical management and treatment of these patients to optimize patient outcomes and medical costs </plain></SENT>
