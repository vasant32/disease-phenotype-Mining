<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The objective was to assess the utility of total tau protein (tTau), the ratio of (tTau)/181 phosphorylated tau protein (P-Tau) and 14-3-3 protein, as diagnostic markers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CJD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CSF samples received from Norwegian hospitals between August 2005 and August 2007 were retrospectively selected from consecutive patients with tTau values &gt; 1200 ng/L (n = 38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The samples from patients clinically diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CJD</z:e> (n = 12) were compared to those from patients with other degenerative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e>: Alzheimer's/vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD/VaD, n = 21), other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> (OND, n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total Tau, P-Tau, and beta-Amyloid (Abeta42) were measured with commercial kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, 14-3-3 protein was measured semi-quantitatively by immunoblot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The minimum cut-off limits for diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CJD</z:e> were chosen from the test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For tTau the lower limit was fixed at 3000 ng/L, for the tTau/P-Tau ratio it was 60, and for 14-3-3 protein it was 0.75 arbitrary units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For tTau and tTau/P-Tau ratio, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CJD</z:e> patients had levels above the minimum, whereas almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the other patients were below </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the 14-3-3 protein, two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CJD</z:e> patients were below the minimum and five were above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only one of the other patients was higher than the limit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The sensitivities, specificities and diagnostic efficiencies were: tTau 75%, 92%, and 87%; tTau/P-Tau 75%, 96%, and 89%; and 14-3-3 protein 80%, 96%, and 91% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggest that 14-3-3 protein may be the better marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CJD</z:e>, tTau/P-Tau ratio and tTau are also efficient markers, but showed slightly inferior diagnostic properties in this study, with tTau/P-Tau marginally better than tTau </plain></SENT>
