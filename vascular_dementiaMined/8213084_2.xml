<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The generalized form of von Winiwarter-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040021" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Buerger's disease</z:e> (WBD) occasionally involves the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, pure cerebral forms of the disease were also described by Spatz and Lindenberg ("Spatz-Lindenberg's disease", SLD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both, the type I, which involves the large basal arteries, and the type II, which results in a sickle-shaped granular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the cerebral cortex, are often accompanied by ("vascular") <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, which Lindenberg and Spatz mainly attributed to the bilateral involvement of the second frontal gyrus by granular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, synaptic deprivation of the cortical gray matter has been shown to occur in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer type (DAT) and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In DAT, the synaptic loss highly correlated with the degree of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>mental impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We wanted to examine whether similar changes also occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of vascular origin, for which SLD, although infrequent, is a typical example </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In fact, we found that in three cases of typical SLD type II the synaptophysin immunoreactivity of the cortical neuropil in areas without overt <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> or scar formation was as much reduced as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although it must be taken into account that in the present cases the synapse loss might, at least in part, be due to secondary (Wallerian) degeneration as a result of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> in the "watershed" regions of the arterial blood supply, it cannot be excluded that a decline of cortical synaptic contacts in areas without necroses or scars may occur as a primary event, contributing to the pathogenesis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Final conclusions can only be expected from investigations into further cases of cerebro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disorders</z:e> with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
