<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>How alcohol consumption affects the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is less clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the prospective relationship of alcohol consumption and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> among older adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Nested case-control study of 373 cases with incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 373 controls who were among 5888 adults aged 65 years and older who participated in the Cardiovascular Health Study, a prospective, population-based cohort study in 4 US communities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The controls were frequency-matched on age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> before 1999, and their attendance of a 1998-1999 clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants in this study underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and cognitive testing between 1992 and 1994 and were followed up until 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds of incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, ascertained by detailed neurological and neuropsychological examinations according to average alcohol consumption, assessed by self-reported intake of beer, wine, and liquor at 2 visits prior to the date of the MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with abstention, the adjusted odds for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> among those whose weekly alcohol consumption was less than 1 drink were 0.65 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41-1.02); 1 to 6 drinks, 0.46 (95% CI, 0.27-0.77); 7 to 13 drinks, 0.69 (95% CI, 0.37-1.31); and 14 or more drinks, 1.22 (95% CI, 0.60-2.49; P for quadratic term =.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A trend toward greater odds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> associated with heavier alcohol consumption was most apparent among men and participants with an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E epsilon4 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found generally similar relationships of alcohol use with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with abstention, consumption of 1 to 6 drinks weekly is associated with a lower risk of incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> among older adults </plain></SENT>
