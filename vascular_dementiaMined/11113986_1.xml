<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and four elderly subjects (65 years and over) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, referred to secondary hospital services and who had brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans as part of routine clinical investigations, were studied by review of their MRI scans using a standardized procedure and by examination of the case notes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients with a clinical diagnosis of senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> Alzheimer-type (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e>), the diagnosis was reviewed in 11.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, the diagnosis was reviewed in 62 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients without a firm clinical diagnosis, radiological features compatible with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> were seen in 44.4% and with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in 27.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 2/104 patients showed a significant focal lesion on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the variables studied (age, sex, degree of hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, extent of T2 hyper-intensities, and enlargement of the sulcal and ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces) only hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> predicted the MMSE score ( p &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MRI brain scanning has an important role in aiding and refining the clinical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the elderly </plain></SENT>
