<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we investigated the first known Taiwanese family affected by CADASIL and identified an uncommon NOTCH3 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The family had clinical manifestations in affected members including recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, early <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A skin biopsy in the proband patient showed characteristic pathological findings of CADASIL on electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Afterward, genetic analysis found an Arg332Cys mutation at exon 6 of NOTCH3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological evaluation showed vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in two of four affected people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Head MRI showed multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in bilateral basal ganglia, thalami, periventricular white matter, external capsules, and brainstem, but involvement of the anterior temporal pole was found only in two people with milder symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, the Arg332Cys NOTCH3 mutation at exon 6, which was identified in the studied family, has not been reported in Asian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings emphasize the importance of genetic analysis of NOTCH3 for Asians with a phenotype typical of CADASIL </plain></SENT>
