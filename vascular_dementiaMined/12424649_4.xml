<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Participants were diagnosed with possible or probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (SVaD), or were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (NoDx) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Groups were matched for age and education, and clinical groups were matched for severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate and univariate analyses of variance were performed which indicated that the AD and SVaD patients differed from the NoDx on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measures of executive functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, the AD group made significantly more episodic memory errors than the SVaD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, consistent with previous research, the SVaD group performed significantly better than the AD group on recognition memory, but not on free recall measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Present findings suggest that AD patients have more executive self-monitoring problems than SVaD patients do, but SVaD patients have more retrieval problems (executive memory search), suggesting a fractionation of executive abilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, differences between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups depend on the nature of the executive function assessed </plain></SENT>
