<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this review, we discuss the relationships of hypertensive small vessel disease (HSVD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> (CAA), which are the representative types of subcortical and cortical small vessel diseases, respectively.&lt;br/&gt; HSVD predominantly affects the penetrating artery territories, and CAA is located at the cerebral cortices admixed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>senile plaques</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The former causes lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and white matter lesions, whereas the latter results in subcortical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent development in magnetic resonance imaging has enabled differentiation of CAA-related micro-lesions including lobar cerebral microbleeds, cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and cortical microinfarcts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both HSVD and CAA are differentially located in the brain, but patients with higher degree of CAA are predisposed to have more severe HSVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is likely that these diseases progress in concert with each other with advancing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The interaction between HSVD and CAA may explain the pathophysiology of VCI and but further investigations are required to understand this </plain></SENT>
