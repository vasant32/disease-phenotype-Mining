<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A few studies have compared neuropsychiatric disturbances between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtypes, but the results were conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated whether the prevalence of NPSs differs between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The merit of our study is that we used clinical as well as histopathological information to differentiate between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This retrospective descriptive study comprised 80 brains obtained from donors to the Netherlands Brain Bank between 1984 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These donors were diagnosed postmortem with AD (n = 40) or VaD (n = 40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We assessed the presence of NPSs by reviewing the information found in the patients' medical files </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most prevalent symptom in the sample as a whole was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> (45 cases, 57.0%), followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (33, 41.2%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> (28, 35.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study tried to contribute to the discussion by including, for the first time in the literature, a sample of AD and VaD patients with neuropathologically confirmed diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since no significant differences were found between AD and VaD patients, we suggest that the prevalence of NPSs cannot be predicted from the diagnosis of AD or VaD </plain></SENT>
