<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The fundamental problems of case and control selection persist, such as use of prevalent cases, selection through contact with specific services, difficulties of control choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Risk factors such as family history and head trauma are shown again, although the biases introduced in collection of exposure data could still account for these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other associations which are shown, such as smoking may be accounted for by factors related to survival and use of prevalent cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The direct public health implications of these findings are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intervention based on many of the associations found in this re-analysis would have relatively low impact on overall rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> because of the small proportion of the population exposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total public health impact of any such intervention would be also limited according to the contribution which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> makes to overall rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Improvement of cardiovascular indices may improve the cerebrovascular status of the population, possibly reducing the incidence of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other broad strategies to maintain health and function would seem prudent, but specific recommendations to reduce the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, or to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slow progression</z:hpo> of the disorder cannot be recommended on the basis of these re-analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is clear that more research is needed to understand the risks of different pathologies related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1392786" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive change</z:e> generally in the population.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
