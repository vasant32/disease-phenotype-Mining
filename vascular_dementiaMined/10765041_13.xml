<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The PvuII and XbaI restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the ER-alpha gene were represented as Pp (PvuII) and Xx (XbaI), with capital letters signifying the absence of restriction sites and small letters the presence of restriction sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that the frequency of the ER-alpha gene P allele and X allele in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> AD (LOAD) group (P allele was 0.51, X allele was 0.30) was significantly higher than that in controls (P 0.38, p &lt; 0.01; X 0.20, p &lt; 0.01), and that the frequency of the ER-alpha gene P allele and PP genotype was significantly different between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E epsilon4 carriers and noncarriers in LOAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the genotype of the ER-alpha gene may be specific in LOAD, and that the ER-alpha gene was an additional risk for LOAD </plain></SENT>
