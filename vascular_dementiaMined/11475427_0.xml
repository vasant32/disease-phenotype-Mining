<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purposes of our investigation were (a) to study the relationship between aging and the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and the ratio of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), (b) to understand the features of early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> as seen in patients from 60 to 65 years, and (c) to examine the recognition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> by family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subjects of the study, a total of 4,368, were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 60 years old and over and were residing in the three areas of Nagasaki Prefecture at the time of the investigation, August 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We adopted a two-stage design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first-stage questionnaire that we developed was delivered to subjects, and we selected for the second stage those subjects who met the criteria outlined in the Methods section </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second-stage investigation was an interview by community nurses and psychiatrists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in subjects 60 years and over was 6.2% (men: 5.9%; women: 6.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence increased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The AD/VD ratio was 1.4, and was similar to the recent trend in Japan in that the ratio has reversed to resemble the western pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In regard to the family members' recognition of illness, the higher the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, the higher the recognition ratio of family members became </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only half of these subjects were recognized as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> by their family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the westernization of the AD/VD ratio in Japan was proved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was little study about family recognition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In this study, it was remarkable that only half of the subjects were recognized as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> by their family members </plain></SENT>
