<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between cognitive and behavioral impairments in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and to examine whether the addition of cerebrovascular disease modifies that relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Correlational analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: An outpatient <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: An autopsy-confirmed series of 28 patients with AD and 16 patients with mixed Alzheimer and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MIX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Neuropsychological and behavioral tests during life: Mini-Mental State (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi>), Blessed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Scale (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BDS</z:e>), Haycox <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Behavior Scale (HDBS), and two non-cognitive functional scales derived from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BDS</z:e> and HDBS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the AD group, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> scores correlated significantly with scores on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BDS</z:e>, HDBS, and two non-cognitive functional scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the MIX group, however, no significant relationship was observed between <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> scores and scores on any of the behavioral measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that in AD, cognitive and behavioral impairments progress simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, with the addition of a vascular component to the dementing process, cognitive and behavioral impairments may progress more independently </plain></SENT>
