<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Vantaa 85+ study included 553 residents living in the city of Vantaa, Finland, and aged ≥85 years on April 1, 1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Survivors were reexamined in 1994, 1996, 1999, and 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Autopsies were performed in 291 persons who died during the follow-up (48% of total population) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was assessed according to self-report, medical record of physician-diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, or use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Macroscopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were identified from 1-cm coronal slices of cerebral hemispheres, 5-mm transverse brainstem slices, and sagittal cerebellum slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6824">Methenamine</z:chebi> silver staining was used for β-amyloid, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6824">methenamine</z:chebi> silver-Bodian staining for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo>, and modified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1389790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Bielschowsky</z:e> method for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>neuritic plaques</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards and multiple logistic regression models were used to analyze the association of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and neuropathology, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> at baseline doubled the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, AD, and VaD, and increased mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were less likely to have β-amyloid (hazard ratio [HR] [95% confidence interval (CI)] was 0.48 [0.23-0.98]) and tangles (HR [95% CI] 0.72 [0.39-1.33]) but more likely to have cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (HR [95% CI] 1.88 [1.06-3.34]) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> adjustments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Elderly patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> develop more extensive vascular pathology, which alone or together with AD-type pathology (particularly in APOE ε4 carriers) results in increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
