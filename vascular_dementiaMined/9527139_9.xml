<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To provide the clinician with a guide to the clinical utility of 99mTc-HMPAO single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) and to the interpretation of specific test results in the differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three hundred and sixty three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were studied prospectively for a median three (range 1-6) years and classified into disease groups on the basis of established clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The degree to which different patterns of cerebral blood flow (CBF) abnormality found on 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT imaging at the time of initial patient presentation modified clinical diagnoses was determined by calculating the likelihood ratios for pairwise disease group comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The optimal clinical usage of 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT was determined by calculating the percentage of significant test results for each pairwise disease group comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bilateral posterior CBF abnormality was found to significantly increase the odds of a patient having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> as opposed to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bilateral anterior CBF abnormality significantly increased the odds of a patient having <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> as opposed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752347" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="DLB">Lewy body disease</z:e>. "Patchy" CBF changes significantly increased the odds of a patient having vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> as opposed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unilateral anterior, unilateral anterior plus unilateral posterior, and generalised CBF abnormality failed to contribute to the differentiation of any of these forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT was found to be most useful in distinguishing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> from vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and fronto temporal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and least useful in differentiating between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752347" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="DLB">Lewy body disease</z:e>, and between vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo>, and progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that CBF SPECT should be used selectively and as an adjunct to clinical evaluation and CT </plain></SENT>
