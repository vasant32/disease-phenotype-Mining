<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Female primary caregivers were drawn from the first wave (N = 2043) of the National Longitudinal Caregiver Study, a survey of informal caregivers of elderly male veterans diagnosed with probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cost measures include the following four items: value of caregiving time, caregiver's lost income, out-of-pocket expenditures for formal caregiving services, and caregiver's excess health costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Disease severity was indexed by the number of impairments in activities of daily living </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260653" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">problem behaviors</z:e> were measured using the Behavior Rating Scale-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The annual cost of providing informal care to elderly community-dwelling veterans with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was estimated to be $18,385 per patient in 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The larger components of this cost are caregiving time ($6,295) and caregiver's lost earnings ($10,709) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> aspects of costs increase with disease severity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260653" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">problem behavior</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most of this cost increase derives from the increased caregiving time required for the provision of physical care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: This study provides a comprehensive estimate of the excess costs that result from providing informal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> care in the community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Unlike previous studies, our estimates excluded costs that caregivers would have incurred if they had not been caregivers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, results reported here reflect only costs due to informal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> care </plain></SENT>
