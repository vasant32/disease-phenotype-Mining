<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) in the United States was estimated at 2.3 million in 2002 by the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS), which is almost 50% less than the estimate of 4.5 million in 2000 derived from the Chicago Health and Aging Project </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We considered how differences in diagnostic criteria may have contributed to these differences in AD prevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified several important differences in diagnostic criteria that may have contributed to the differing estimates of AD prevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two factors were especially noteworthy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e> III-R and IV criteria of functional limitation documented by an informant used in ADAMS effectively concentrated the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> toward a relatively higher level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ADAMS separately identified a category of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and within that group there were a substantial number of cases with "prodromal" AD (a maximum of 1.95 million with upweighting) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Second, a substantial proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in ADAMS was attributed to either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> (representing a maximum of 0.59 million with upweighting) or undetermined etiology (a maximum of 0.34 million), whereas most <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, including mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, was attributed to AD in the Chicago Health and Aging Project </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of AD in population studies is a complex process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When a diagnosis of AD excludes persons meeting criteria for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, when not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are assigned an etiology, and when a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> requires an informant report of functional limitations, the prevalence is substantially lower and the diagnosed cases most likely have a relatively higher level of impairment </plain></SENT>
