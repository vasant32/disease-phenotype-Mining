<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 2-phase cross-sectional study was designed in order to determine the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, its subtypes, and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in a Bulgarian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study sample consisted of 605 participants over the age of 65, residents of the city of Varna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 540 participants (89%) completed the screening phase of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> positive screens and a control group were included in the diagnostic phase of the study, where comprehensive neuropsychological, clinical, and imaging assessments were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 39 persons (7.2%) and 36 had mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (6.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> was the most frequent type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (3.1%), followed by vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (2.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Our results support the hypothesis that prevalence of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> may be higher in Bulgaria than in most European countries </plain></SENT>
