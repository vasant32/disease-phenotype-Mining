<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CADASIL is caused by mutations in NOTCH3, one of the four mammalian homologs to the Drosophila melanogaster NOTCH gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Disease-associated mutations are distributed throughout the 34 epidermal growth factor-like repeats (EGFRs) that compose the extracellular domain of the Notch3 receptor and result in a loss or a gain of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32460">cysteine residue</z:chebi> in one of these EGFRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In human adults, Notch3 expression is highly restricted to vascular smooth-muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with CADASIL, there is an abnormal accumulation of Notch3 in the vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Molecular pathways linking NOTCH3 mutations to degeneration of vascular smooth-muscle cells are as yet poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effect of CADASIL mutations on Notch3 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We studied five naturally occurring mutations: R90C and C212S, located in the previously identified mutational hotspot EGFR2-5; C428S, shown in this study to be located in the ligand-binding domain EGFR10-11; and C542Y and R1006C, located in EGFR13 and EGFR26, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five mutant proteins were correctly processed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The C428S and C542Y mutant receptors exhibited a significant reduction in Jagged1-induced transcriptional activity of a RBP/JK responsive luciferase reporter, relative to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> Notch3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Impaired signaling activity of these two mutants arose through different mechanisms; the C428S mutant lost its Jagged1-binding ability, whereas C542Y retained it but exhibited an impaired presentation to the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the R90C, C212S, and R1006C mutants retained the ability to bind Jagged1 and were associated with apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of signaling activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that mutations in Notch3 differently affect Jagged1 binding and Notch3 signaling via the RBP/JK pathway </plain></SENT>
