<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To estimate the proportion of community-dwelling older adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> being prescribed a psychotropic and to identify patient and caregiver factors associated with antipsychotic use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS) from 2002 to 2004 designed to assess <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity and service use of community-dwelling older adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of psychotropic medication (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi>, antidepressants, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsants</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepines</z:chebi>) use was tabulated and weighted to the U.S. population according to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis identified factors associated with antipsychotic use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 307 ADAMS participants had the following <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnoses: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (69.3%), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (17.7%), and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (12.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportion of participants prescribed a psychotropic medication broken down according to therapeutic class was 19.1% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi>, 29.1% antidepressants, 9.8% <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepines</z:chebi>, and 8.8% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Older adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were significantly more likely to receive an antipsychotic if they had moderate (odds ratio (OR) = 7.4, P = .002) or severe (OR = 5.80, P = .002) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> than if they had mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (OR = 6.7, P = .04) compared to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Older adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> who lived with a caregiver were significantly less likely to taking an antipsychotic (OR = 0.19, P = .001) than those who lived alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were significantly less likely to be prescribed an antipsychotic if their caregiver was clinically depressed (OR = 0.03, P = .005) than if their caregiver was not depressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Psychotropic medication use is common in community-dwelling older adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Caregivers appear to have a substantial effect on whether an antipsychotic is prescribed, which adds additional complexity to conversations discussing the risk:benefit ratio of this medication class </plain></SENT>
