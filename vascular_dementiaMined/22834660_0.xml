<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of this study was to clinically evaluate percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>) tube feeding of elderly Japanese patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The records of the 155 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> who underwent <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> in Juntendo Tokyo Koto Geriatric Medical Center were reviewed for pertinent clinical data, including diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, place of stay before and after hospitalization, as well as survival rate, albumin levels, and incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011951'>aspiration pneumonia</z:hpo> (AP) before and 6 months after <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The latter three data of these patients were compared with those of 106 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> fed through a nasogastric (NG) tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were predominant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three percent of the patients were admitted from their home; the number of discharges to homes decreased to 21.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean (SD) of the albumin levels was 2.9 (0.4) g/dl before feeding and 2.9 (0.6) g/dl after 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the patients with AP before <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> tube feeding, 51.6% had an AP recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, AP occurred in 9.4% of the patients without AP before feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient survival rate was higher by 27 months when using <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> tube than when using an NG tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> tube feeding in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> leads to preservation of status for a few years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared with NG tube feeding, <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> tube feeding did not induce AP due to impairment of intact swallowing function, and was associated with higher survival rate of approximately 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> tube feeding does not seem to promote home medical care </plain></SENT>
