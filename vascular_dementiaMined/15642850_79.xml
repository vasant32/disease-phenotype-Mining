<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is unclear, particularly prior to and around the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the clinical syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the natural history of weight change from mid to late life in men with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in late life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: The Honolulu-Asia Aging Study, a 32-year, prospective, population-based study of Japanese American men who had been weighed on 6 occasions between 1965 and 1999 and who had been screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> 3 times between 1991 and 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Of 1890 men (aged 77-98 years), 112 with incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were compared with 1778 without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at the sixth examination (1997-1999) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Weight change up to and including the sixth examination was treated as the dependent variable and estimated using a repeated measures analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Groups with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> did not differ with respect to baseline weight or change in weight from mid to late life (first 26 years' follow-up) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the late-life examinations (final 6 years), mean age- and education-adjusted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> was -0.22 kg/y (95% confidence intervals, -0.26 to -0.18) in participants without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Men with incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at the same examination had an additional yearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> of -0.36 kg (95% confidence interval, -0.53 to -0.19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was not changed substantially with adjustment for risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> or functional impairment and was significant for both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> begins before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the clinical syndrome and accelerates by the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The potential impact on prognosis should be considered in the case of elderly persons at risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
