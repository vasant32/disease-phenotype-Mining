<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Studies on the status of the immune system in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mental disorders</z:e> have mostly provided contradictory results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For example, some authors have reported dramatic increases of immunoglobulin G in schizophrenic patients, and others a decrease of immunoglobulin G in the same patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This prompted us to undertake a study on a large cohort of psychiatric patients (120 schizophrenics, 30 manic-depressives, 8 epileptics, 48 cases of Alzheimer and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 23 cases of alcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 14 cases of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0000709'>psychosis</z:hpo>, 47 encephalopaths, and 21 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> alcoholics), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> chronically hospitalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma antitetanus antibodies were assayed in 238 previously immunized patients, the tuberculin test was performed on 302 patients, and the candidine test on 287 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 21 patients had an antitetanus vaccine booster injection with antibodies assayed before the injection and one month later, and 31 patients had 2 tuberculin tests with a year or more between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results show no major abnormal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune disorders</z:e> in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless some particular features have been found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The first is a very significant relation between the age and the <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of the immune defences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The second is a large scattering of the blood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039614" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tetanus</z:e> antibodies titers in schizophrenic patients, specially in the paranoid subgroup (20.6% of abnormally high or low titers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>And the third is the existence of inpredictable variations in the responses when stimulations, or tests, are repeated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results can raise the hypothesis of a state-dependent component of the immune response in mentally ill patients, but further in, depth studies are needed for better understanding the nature of our findings </plain></SENT>
