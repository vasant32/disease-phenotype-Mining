<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its application leads to some negative gastrointestinal side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study observes galantamine-induced influence on gastrointestinal motility of rats and its effects on isolated gastrointestinal smooth muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The gastrointestinal tract was studied by X-ray contrast examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional disturbances were observed: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001276'>hypertonia</z:hpo>, increased stomach and ileal peristalsis activity, accelerated intestinal passage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro, the drug caused tonic contractions in smooth muscle preparations and increased the gastric and ileal phasic amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The jejunal smooth muscle strips demonstrated an opposite tendency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reactions were a result of the interaction of galantamine-accumulated endogenic acetycholine with M- and N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The tonic effects were influenced in varying degree by <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5956">ipratropium</z:chebi>, whereas the phasic by <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5956">ipratropium</z:chebi>, hexametonium and methysergide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the in vitro effects registered satisfactorily explain in vivo examined galantamine-induced changes in the gastrointestinal tract of the treated rats and can be considered as main cause for development of such changes </plain></SENT>
