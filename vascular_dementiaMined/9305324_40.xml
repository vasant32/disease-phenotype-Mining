<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also wished to compare the performance of the new criteria to that of the Hachinski Ischemic Score (HIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study was comprised of a retrospective chart review and clinicopathologic correlation, and took place in 304-bed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-care geriatric hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjects were 113 autopsied elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, who were assessed to determine sensitivity and specificity of the ADDTC and NINDS-AIREN criteria for possible VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using the neuropathologic diagnosis as a gold standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity was 0.63, and specificity was 0.64 for the ADDTC, 0.58 sensitivity and 0.80 specificity for the NINDS, and 0.43 sensitivity and 0.88 specificity for the HIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Test combinations did not lead to substantial gains in sensitivity or specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> were successfully excluded by the ADDTC (87%), the NINDS-AIREN (91%), and the HIS (97%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportion of mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases clinically misclassified as VaD was 54% for the ADDTC, 29% for the NINDS-AIREN, and 18% for the HIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Low sensitivity is the main <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of the above clinical criteria for possible VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is better excluded by the NINDS-AIREN than the ADDTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Data from this validation study should provide valuable information to clinicians and researchers who wish to apply these criteria to the diagnosis of VaD </plain></SENT>
