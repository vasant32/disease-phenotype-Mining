<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Behavioural and psychological symptoms of 484 VaD patients included in a large multicentre clinical trial (registration number NCT00099216) were determined using the 12-item Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Symptoms were considered present when the score was &gt; or =1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on MRI, patients were classified as having small-vessel VaD (83%) or large-vessel VaD (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Behavioural and psychological symptoms were reported in 92% of the VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median NPI score of the total study population was 9 (0-76), with a median number of three symptoms per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>Apathy</z:hpo> (65%) was most prevalent, followed by depressive symptoms (45%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo> (42%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with small-vessel VaD reported more <z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo>, aberrant motor behaviour and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000738'>hallucinations</z:hpo> than patients with large-vessel VaD (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, patients with large-vessel VaD reported a higher severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> and euphoria (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Behavioural and psychological symptoms are common in VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with small-vessel and large-vessel VaD demonstrate different profiles of symptoms, with especially more <z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo> in small-vessel VaD and more <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo>/agression in large-vessel VaD </plain></SENT>
