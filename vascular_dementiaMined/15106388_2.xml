<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These behavioral symptoms can be a major cause of stress, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, and concern for caregivers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35471">psychotropic drugs</z:chebi> are frequently used to control these symptoms, they can be accompanied by significant side effects, which include sedation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000734'>disinhibition</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">incontinence</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0392156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">akathisias</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>Agitation</z:hpo> is a major problem in older patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>Agitation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> have always been difficult behaviors to manage, and when it is severe, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> can be a behavioral emergency that requires urgent and immediate intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This six-month study included a group of 94 outpatients (48 men and 46 women) who had a diagnosis of subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To be eligible for the study, patients needed a score of at least 3 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), suggesting at least moderate frequency and/or severity, and 0 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000746'>delusions</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000738'>hallucinations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two homogenous groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Group A received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7735">olanzapine</z:chebi> (2.5-5 mg/day) and Group B received bromazepam (0.25 percent, 15 drops, three times per day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients in both groups were allowed to continue any previous therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7735">olanzapine</z:chebi> at an average dose of 3.21 +/- 1.02 mg/day showed statistically significant improvement on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> rating compared with those receiving bromazepam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our patients had a host of medical conditions and received numerous concomitant medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Given the potential complications associated with these therapeutic agents, these patients tolerated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7735">olanzapine</z:chebi> quite well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It appeared that adverse events, particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001262'>somnolence</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002172'>postural instability</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>postural hypotension</z:hpo>, were mild and transient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Moreover, no anticholinerigic effect was registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7735">olanzapine</z:chebi> could be a safe and effective treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> in cognitively impaired patients </plain></SENT>
