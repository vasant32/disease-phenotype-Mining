<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used immunochemical methods to compare quantities of amyloid-beta (Abeta) <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> in post mortem brain samples from VaD, AD subjects and nondemented ageing controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total Abeta <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> extracted from temporal and frontal cortices were quantified using a previously characterized sensitive homogenous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The HTRF assays and immunocapture mass spectrometric analyses revealed that the Abeta(42) species were by far the predominant form of extractable <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> compared with Abeta(40) <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in VaD brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The strong signal intensity for the peak representing Abeta(4-42) <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> confirmed that these N-terminally truncated species are relatively abundant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Absolute quantification by HTRF assay showed that the mean amount of total Abeta(42) recovered from VaD samples was approximately 50% of that in AD, and twice that in the age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Linear correlation analysis further revealed an increased accumulation with age of both Abeta <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> in brains of VaD subjects and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, VaD patients surviving beyond 80 years of age exhibited comparable Abeta(42) concentrations with those in AD in the temporal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that brain Abeta accumulates increasingly with age in VaD subjects more so than in elderly without cerebrovascular disease and support the notion that they acquire Alzheimer-like pathology in older age </plain></SENT>
