<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Claudins (<z:chebi fb="193" ids="17996">Cls</z:chebi>) are a multigene family of transmembrane proteins with different tissue distribution, which have an essential role in the formation and sealing capacity of tight junctions (TJs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the level of the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>), TJs are the main <z:chebi fb="22" ids="24431">molecular structures</z:chebi> which separate the neuronal milieu from the circulatory space, by a restriction of the paracellular flow of water, ions and larger molecules into the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Different studies suggested recently significant <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> alterations in both vascular and degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a previous study we found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) brains an altered expression of occludin, a molecular partner of <z:chebi fb="193" ids="17996">Cls</z:chebi> in the TJs structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore in this study, using an immunohistochemical approach, we investigated the expression of Cl family proteins (Cl-2, Cl-5 and Cl-11) in frontal cortex of aged control, AD and VaD brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To estimate the number of Cl-expressing cells, we applied a random systematic sampling and the unbiased optical fractionator method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found selected neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and endothelial cells expressing Cl-2, Cl-5 and Cl-11 at detectable levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We report a significant increase in ratio of neurons expressing Cl-2, Cl-5 and Cl-11 in both AD and VaD as compared to aged controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ratio of astrocytes expressing Cl-2 and Cl-11 was significantly higher in AD and VaD as compared to aged controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ratio of oligodendrocytes expressing Cl-11 was significantly higher in AD and the ratio of oligodendrocytes expressing Cl-2 was significantly higher in VaD as compared to aged controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Within the cerebral cortex, <z:chebi fb="193" ids="17996">Cls</z:chebi> were selectively expressed by pyramidal neurons, which are the ones responsible for cognitive processes and affected by AD pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest a new function of Cl family proteins which might be linked to response to cellular stress </plain></SENT>
