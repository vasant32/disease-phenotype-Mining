<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: The subjects aged â‰¥ 65 years were recruited prospectively from the Geriatrics Clinic of Gulhane Medical School, between 2004 and 2008 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: 1302 patients were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Cognitive status, clinical diagnosis of CD (MCI, AD, and VaD) and clinical and environmental risk factors were evaluated by comprehensive geriatric assesment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, the subjects were categorized into two groups according to having CD or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 905 (69.5%) subjects were not having CD whereas 397 (30.5%) patients with CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with CD, 140 (10.4%) had MCI, 227 (16.9%) AD, and 30 (2.2%) VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for confounding with a model for multiple regression analysis, age (OR=1.054; CI:1.027-1.083; p &lt; 0.001) and family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (OR=1.662; CI:1.038-2.660; p=0.034) were found to be independent risk factors for CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, overweight (OR=0.594; CI:0.370-0.952; p=0.03) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (OR=0.396; CI:0.242-0.649; p &lt; 0.001), and high education level (OR=0.640; CI:0.451-0.908; p=0.012) were found to be independent protective factors for CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found the risk of CD decreases in overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the primary prevention should not only consider risk factors, but must also take anthropometric data into consideration in order to identify persons at high risk for CD </plain></SENT>
