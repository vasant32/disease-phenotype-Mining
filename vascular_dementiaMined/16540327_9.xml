<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study measures the haemodynamics of these diseases in absolute rather than relative terms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients were classified as either early AD or VaD and were compared with 12 non-cognitively impaired subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging flow quantification was used to measure arterial inflow and arterial pulse volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean vascular resistance and compliance were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In AD, the arterial inflow was lower by 18%, resistance was higher by 23% and compliance of the arterial tree was lower by 20% compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (p=0.01, 0.02 and 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In VaD, the arterial pulse volume was higher by 24% and compliance was higher by 35% compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (p=0.05 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early VaD is characterized by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood flow, but increased pulsation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reduced blood flow and an incompliant arterial tree characterize early AD </plain></SENT>
