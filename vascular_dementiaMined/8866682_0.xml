<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No antibodies against vascular endothelial cell (VEC) specific antigenic systems have been demonstrated in the pathogenesis of small vessel (lacunar) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, though autoantibodies have been detected in 80% of patients with multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied VEC-specific antibodies in 17 patients with a diagnosis of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; in 17 nondemented patients with small vessel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and in 16 healthy, nondemented control group patients by using the Terasaki microtoxicity method </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VEC-specific antibodies were positive in 94% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients, whereas no antibodies were detected in patients with small vessel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> or in the control group </plain></SENT>
