<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results showed that the mean escape latency in the electro-acupuncture group was markedly reduced in place test, and the times swam the place of the plate-form in the original plate-form quadrant were significantly more than those in the rest three quadrants in spatial probe test as compared with the model group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the electro-acupuncture group and the nimodipine group the contents of NO and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and the activity of NOS were decreased, while the activities of SOD and GSH-Px were increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is indicated that electro-acupuncture can modulate the production and clearance of free radicals, and improve the ability of learning and memory of the VD model rats </plain></SENT>
