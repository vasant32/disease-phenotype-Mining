<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known whether prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the elderly is possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some evidence exists that both vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and Alzheimer's type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main goal of the CASCADE Krak贸w Project is to study the relation between the exposure to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> risk factors in the middle age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and cerebral white matter lesions in old age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Project CASCADE Krak贸w is an independent part of the international project CASCADE, which is carried out in 11 research centres from 9 countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Polish part of the study includes a longitudinal observation of the sample screened earlier in POL-MONICA Krak贸w Project, which was selected from population of residents of rural province (Tarnobrzeg Voivodship) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Studied sample are 1318 persons, for whom <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> risk factors were measured in 1983-84 and who completed at least 64 years in 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two-stage examination was designed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the first stage collection of the following data was designed: socio-economic factors, history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, perceived health, blood pressure and cognitive function assessment using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the second stage (sub-sample of 300 persons included) the following procedures were designed: detailed neuro-psychological testing, neurolo-gical examination, MRI, determination of total- and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> and determination of apoE isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were 625 (47%) men and 693 (53%) women selected for the first stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Out of them 128 (43%) men and 172 (57%) women were selected for the second stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no important differences in age, education, health status and exposure to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> risk factors between the studied groups in the baseline assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, there were important differences between men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Compared to men, women had lower education (higher than elementary education in 17% and 9% respectively), more frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (respectively 12% and 36%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (respectively 57% and 71%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010980'>hyperlipoproteinemia</z:hpo> (respectively 17% and 30%) but lower smoking rate (respectively 53% and 4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Integration of neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging with the epidemiological approach to risk factors could contribute to better understanding of the mechanisms on which the disease affects the brain <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The results of CASCADE and CASCADE Krak贸w projects will contribute also to the development of the strategies of medical care and management of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in the elderly </plain></SENT>
