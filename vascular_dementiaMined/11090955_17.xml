<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, one investigated whether SHRSP might be a useful animal model for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An impairment of learning-memory function was found in SHRSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A disturbance in circadian rhythm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in SHRSP was clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Desynchronization of light and dark alternation cycles and abnormal rhythm were also demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These observations point to the possibility that the decreased passive avoidance response observed in SHRSP might be similar to the phenomenon of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a correlation between passive avoidance response latency and hippocampal <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> levels was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that decreased <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> levels in both the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus may be related to the impairment of learning-memory function and <z:mp ids='MP_0004924'>abnormal behavior</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In SHRSP, increases in blood viscosity, hematocrit and fibrinogen might produce the formation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
