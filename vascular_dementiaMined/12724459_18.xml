<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors used the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> subscale of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), an instrument with established reliability and validity, to compare patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were identified in a query of the UCLA <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Center database and included 115 patients with probable AD, 43 patients with VaD, 33 patients with FTD, and 40 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, elderly control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Descriptive statistics were generated, and partial correlations, controlling for Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, were performed between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> subscale and other behavioral features as measured by the NPI and the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relationships between cognitive status (as indicated by MMSE score) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> were explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> was reported more commonly in patients with VaD and FTD than in patients with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These differences remained significant (P&lt;0.01) in an analysis of variance (ANOVA) after adjusting for age, age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, educational level, and MMSE score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In AD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> was inversely related to MMSE score (i.e., worse with more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>), was more prevalent among patients with a younger age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (under age 65), and correlated with disability as measured by the FAQ score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> is common among patients with diverse forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In AD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> is most common in those with more severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e> and an earlier age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
