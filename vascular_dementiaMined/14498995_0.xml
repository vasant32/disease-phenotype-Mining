<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to search for clinical and neuroimaging correlates of abnormal SEPs in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 14 VD patients, aged 72.93 PlusMinus; 4.73 years, and 10 controls aged 71.20 PlusMinus; 4.44 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects underwent a detailed clinical examination, blood and biochemical testing, brain MRI and were assessed with the MMSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SEPs were recorded after stimulation from upper and lower limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The statistical Analysis included 1 and 2-way MANCOVAs and Factor analysis RESULTS: The N13 latency was significantly prolonged, the N19 amplitude was lower, the P27 amplitude was lower and the N11-P27 conduction time was prolonged in severely <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients in comparison to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The N19 latency was prolonged in severely <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients in comparison to both mildly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The same was true for the N13-N19 conduction time, and for the P27 latency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical lesions</z:e> had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> their latencies prolonged and lower P27 amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The results of the current study suggest that there are significant differences between patients suffering from VD and healthy controls in SEPs, but these are detectable only when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is severe or there are lesions located in the subcortical regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of the current study locate the abnormal SEPs in the white matter, and are in accord with the literature </plain></SENT>
