<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a study group of 135 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (99 AD, 36 VaD), information on age, gender, education, age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was measured by the following assessment scales: Korean version of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE-K) for cognitive function; Blessed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Scale (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BDS</z:e>) for functional activities of daily living (ADL); Barthel Index (BI) for physical ADL; and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Hamilton <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale (HAM-D) and Hamilton <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> Scale (HAM-A) for BPSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The independent variables between the patients with AD and VaD were compared, and then the correlations of BPSD with other variables were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HAM-D and HAM-A scores were higher in patients with VaD than in those with AD, while other variables demonstrated no statistical differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BPRS score correlated with scores on MMSE-K, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BDS</z:e> and BI in AD, but only with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BDS</z:e> in VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The HAM-D score correlated with scores on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BDS</z:e> and BI in AD, but only with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BDS</z:e> in VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The HAM-A score was correlated with score on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BDS</z:e> in AD not in VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BPSD were more severe in the patients with VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, BPSD correlated more prominently with cognitive or ADL impairments in patients with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Different treatment approaches to BPSD may be required according to the clinical differentiation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> type </plain></SENT>
