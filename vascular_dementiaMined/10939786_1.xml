<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is relatively uncommon and the influence of blood pressure on the risk of other subtypes of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> remains to be clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that vascular risk factors could also play a part in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of the aims of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">Perindopril</z:chebi> Protection Against Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Study (PROGRESS) is to test the hypothesis that blood pressure decreasing treatment based on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> would reduce the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> among patients with cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> procedures in PROGRESS involve a classical two-phase design, with an initial screening phase based mainly on the Mini-Mental State Examination - a simple, brief, and widely used screening test for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second phase involves a diagnostic assessment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in individuals screened as positive according to the criteria of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and statistical manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mental disorders</z:e> (4th ed.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this project, two other domains of the relationship between vascular risk factors and cognition are being explored in relation to PROGRESS substudies </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This will allow study of the relationship between this polymorphism and blood pressure, and of the effect of blood pressure decreasing treatment on the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The magnetic resistance imaging substudy will improve understanding of the relationship between blood pressure decreasing and the occurrence of cerebral white matter lesions, which are known to be related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
