<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the well-controlled study, Choto-san was superior in global improvement rating, utility rating and improvement of subjective symptoms, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852553" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychiatric symptoms</z:e> and disturbance in daily living activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the double-blind study, with more objective criteria than the well-controlled study, Choto-san was also superior in global improvement rating, utility rating and improvement of subjective symptoms, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852553" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychiatric symptoms</z:e> and disturbance in daily living activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Choto-san is effective in the treatment of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
