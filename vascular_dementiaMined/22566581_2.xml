<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To clarify the timing and nature of the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We examined depressive symptoms assessed in midlife (1964-1973) and late life (1994-2000) and the risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD), and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) (2003-2009) in a retrospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Depressive symptoms were categorized as none, midlife only, late life only, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards models (age as timescale) adjusted for demographics and medical comorbidities were used to examine depressive symptom category and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, AD, or VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program of Northern California </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen thousand five hundred thirty-five long-term Kaiser Permanente members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Any medical record diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or neurology clinic diagnosis of AD or VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects had a mean (SD) age of 81.1 (4.5) years in 2003, 57.9% were women, and 24.2% were nonwhite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Depressive symptoms were present in 14.1% of subjects in midlife only, 9.2% in late life only, and 4.2% in both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During 6 years of follow-up, 22.5% were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (5.5% with AD and 2.3% with VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The adjusted hazard of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was increased by approximately 20% for midlife depressive symptoms only (hazard ratio, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.07-1.32]), 70% for late-life symptoms only (1.72 [1.54-1.92]), and 80% for both (1.77 [1.52-2.06]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When we examined AD and VaD separately, subjects with late-life depressive symptoms only had a 2-fold increase in AD risk (hazard ratio, 2.06 [95% CI, 1.67-2.55]), whereas subjects with midlife and late-life symptoms had more than a 3-fold increase in VaD risk (3.51 [2.44-5.05]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms in midlife or in late life are associated with an increased risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> that begins in late life may be part of the AD prodrome, while recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> may be etiologically associated with increased risk of VaD </plain></SENT>
