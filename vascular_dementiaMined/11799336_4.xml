<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two Chinese inpatients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and disruptive behaviors were recruited into an 8-week screening trial of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">haloperidol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five (56%) of them responded insufficiently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They then entered a prospective, 16-week, open-labeled study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">Haloperidol</z:chebi> was abruptly shifted to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> 0.5 mg/day at weeks 1 to 4 and then 1 mg/day at weeks 5 to 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At weeks 13 to 16, the regimen was shifted back to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">haloperidol</z:chebi> at previous doses, mostly 1 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Safety, efficacy, cognition, and moods were evaluated at least every 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Generalized estimating equation methods were used for determining the effects of the prognostic variables on the outcome values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">Risperidone</z:chebi>, particularly at 0.5 mg/day, was generally tolerable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score decreased progressively under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> treatment; at week 12, 16 (46%) patients showed response (&gt;or=25% reduction in the BPRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were more likely to respond than those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> ( p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">Haloperidol</z:chebi> reinstitution resulted in no further improvement, except trend increments in motor symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">Risperidone</z:chebi> also tended to benefit the performance on the Behavioral Pathology in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Rating Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Six (17%) patients improved on moods and self-care with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These preliminary results suggest that crossover from <z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">haloperidol</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> is generally safe and effective and may produce favorable moods in agitated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is a predictor of treatment response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the dose (1 mg/day) recommended for most white individuals, 0.5 mg/day could be tried at first in Chinese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Because of the design's limitations, further controlled studies are warranted </plain></SENT>
