<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 25 hypertensive patients: 13 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> (BD) and 12 with a first-ever <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (LI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline office BP was obtained for 3 consecutive weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From a 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring performed 1 week later we obtained average systolic (SBP) and diastolic (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) BP for daytime, nighttime and 24-h periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SBP and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> variability was defined as the within-subject standard deviation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> readings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A standardized cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> was performed in each patient and an LA score was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No statistically significant correlation was obtained between the LA score and any of the following BP values: 1) Baseline SBP and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>; 2) 24-h, daytime or nighttime SBP and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>, and 3) 24-h, daytime or nighttime SBP and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Increased BP variability is not associated with greater amounts of leukoaraiosis </plain></SENT>
