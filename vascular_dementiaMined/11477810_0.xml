<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-eight patients were randomly divided into treated group and control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In treated group which was treated with ZLD, a self-formulated proved recipe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In control group, which was administered with Naofukang ([symbol: see text]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ZLD could decrease the level of serum cholesterol, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and plasma LPO significantly; increase the level of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) and SOD in red blood cells; dilate cerebral vessels, increase cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As for P300, an index to reflect intelligence, the latency of P3 was shorter and the amplitude was raised, the brain electrical activity monitoring (BEAM) was improved remarkably, the revised Nagayakawa <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> scale scoring (NDS) of patients promoted, clinical symptom was improved significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total effective rate in clinical practice reached 87% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ZLD had good effects on senile vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> indeed </plain></SENT>
