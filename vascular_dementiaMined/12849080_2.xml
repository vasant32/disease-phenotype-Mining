<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have described twelve <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients with noise making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We categorized noise making into (i) persistent screaming, (ii) perseverative vocalization, (iii) continuous chattering, muttering, singing or humming, and (iv) swearing, grunting and bizarre noise-making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients' ages ranged from 70 to 92 years with a mean of 78 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were four males and eight females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and the remaining seven vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five exhibited mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> while another five displayed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one had motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0000711'>restlessness</z:hpo> and four had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000746'>delusions</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000738'>hallucinations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In ten patients the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was moderate to severe with five having total dissolution of speech </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but two were in the third stage of the illness and were totally dependent for basic self care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a wide network of anatomical structures involved in the twelve patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings are related to what is known of the neuroanatomic location of the lesions and the role of frontal subcortical circuitry and neurotransmitter systems in relation to behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Noise-making could be explained by damage to the frontal lobe or interruption of the complex subcortical circuits and related brain chemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Treatment of patients with noise-making remains a challenge </plain></SENT>
