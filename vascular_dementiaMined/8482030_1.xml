<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the 31 patients, 9 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> (BD) (mean age: 64.2 years), 10 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) (mean age: 66.8 years), and 12 were neurologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (mean age: 67.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tracer activity was determined in 7 pairs of cerebellar, cortical, and subcortical regions and was expressed as two ratios: the activity in each region of interest (ROI) compared to the mean count in the cerebellar region (ROI/CER ratio) and compared to the mean count in the occipital cortex (ROI/OCC ratio) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with BD showed a reduction of the ROI/CER ratio in the temporal cortex, thalamus, and basal ganglia compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the ROI/CER ratio for the occipital region was higher than that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, suggesting that cerebellar blood flow was reduced in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AD patients showed a decreased ROI/CER ratio in the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both BD and AD patients showed decreased ROI/OCC ratios in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cortical and subcortical regions compared to the neurologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In BD patients, the most marked reduction of both ratios was found in the thalamus, while for AD patients the most prominent reduction was seen in the parietal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that these two types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> show characteristic regional cerebral blood flow patterns, which may be associated with their clinical features </plain></SENT>
