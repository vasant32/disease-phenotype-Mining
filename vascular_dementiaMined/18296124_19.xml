<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Trials of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37733">cholinesterase inhibitors</z:chebi> in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are difficult because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disease mechanisms and overlap between vascular and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) pathology in the age-group recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> with subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a genetic form of subcortical ischaemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It represents a homogeneous disease process, and because of CADASIL's early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, comorbid AD pathology is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We did a multicentre, 18-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised parallel-group trial to determine whether the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37733">cholinesterase inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> improves cognition in patients with CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 168 patients with CADASIL (mean age 54.8 years) were assigned to 10 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> per day (n=86) or placebo (n=82) by a computer-generated randomisation protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria included a mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score of 10-27 or a trail making test (TMT) B time score at least 1.5 SD below the mean, after adjustment for age and education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was change from baseline in the score on the vascular AD assessment scale cognitive subscale (V-ADAS-cog) at 18 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints included scores on the ADAS-cog, MMSE, TMT A time and B time, Stroop, executive interview-25 (EXIT25), CLOX, disability assessment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and sum of boxes of the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rating scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis was done by intention to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00103948 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: 161 patients were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> (n=84) and placebo (n=77) in the primary endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The least-squares mean change from baseline score was -0.81 (SE 0.59) in the placebo group and -0.85 (SE 0.57) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> group (p=0.956) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was a significant treatment effect favouring <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> on the following secondary outcomes: TMT B time (p=0.023), TMT A time (p=0.015), and EXIT25 (p=0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Ten <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi>-treated patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared to seven placebo-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">Donepezil</z:chebi> had no effect on the primary endpoint, the V-ADAS-cog score in CADASIL patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Improvements were noted on several measures of executive function, but the clinical relevance of these findings is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Our findings may have implications for future trial design in subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
