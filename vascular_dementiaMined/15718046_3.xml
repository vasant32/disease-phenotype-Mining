<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used single voxel 1H MRS to determine the differences in brain neurometabolites in non-infarcted frontal white matter and occipito-parietal gray matter of 48 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and 60 elderly controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that there were no significant neurometabolite differences between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cohort and healthy elderly controls, but there was a difference in <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients that had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (VCI)) compared with those patients with no impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was significant in the occipito-parietal gray matter, but not in the frontal white matter, although the results were in the same direction for the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients may be related to cortical neuronal dysfunction rather than purely subcortical change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, cortical regions not obviously infarcted may have dysfunctional neurons, the pathophysiological basis for which needs further study </plain></SENT>
