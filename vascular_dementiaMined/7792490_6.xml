<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated how <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbance</z:hpo> is correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and decreased daily activity (ADL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008715" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chronically ill</z:e> patients including patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were classified into eight groups based on cognitive function, ADL and grades of PVL (periventricular lucency) as shown by computerized tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Visual monitoring of the sleep/wake state was performed hourly for 14 consecutive days and the daytime sleep hours and the nighttime sleep hours were determined based on detected disturbances in the sleep/wake pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whether any specific infarcted regions were correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbance</z:hpo> was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that daytime sleep hours were increased and nighttime sleep hours were decreased by three single factors: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, decreased ADL and the severe grade of PVL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As for an interactive effect of the two factors, daytime sleep hours were increased by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with decreased ADL (independent of PVL) and increased by decreased ADL with the severe grade of PVL (independent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although three factors affected sleep independently, ADL has an interactive effect on sleep with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and with PVL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No specific cortical regions related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbance</z:hpo> were found </plain></SENT>
