<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recent study from our laboratory showed that CAA also frequently occurred in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with additional mild Alzheimer <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (VaD-ae, i.e. Alzheimer pathology that does not fulfill criteria for AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because CAA is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> and infarctions, it is of significant interest to confirm or dismiss the hypothesis that CAA contributes clinically in the many patients that present with VaD-ae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined entire temporal lobes of 11 VaD-ae cases and 11 age-matched AD cases with Abeta immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six of 11 VaD-ae cases had severe CAA, more extensive than in any AD case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward more cortical infarctions in this group, indicating that CAA in VaD may be of clinical importance and an underestimated cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
