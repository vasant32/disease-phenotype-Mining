<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the usefulness of a Clock Drawing Test, CLOX, in detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in our population and explored its performance in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtypes, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), and the vascular composite group (VCG) of AD with cerebrovascular disease and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: CLOX was administered to 73 subjects (49.3%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 75 healthy controls (50.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic analysis determined the diagnostic accuracy and optimal cut-off scores, stratified by education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of Variance was used to compare CLOX scores between AD and VCG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve) was 84 and 85% for CLOX1 and CLOX2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cut-offs at 10 for CLOX1 and 12 for CLOX2 yielded sensitivities of 75.3 and 75%, and specificities of 76 and 80%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean CLOX1 but not CLOX2 scores for AD (8.1) and VCG (5.5) remained significantly different (p = 0.002) after adjustment for the covariates age, gender, education, MMSE and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results support CLOX as a valid cognitive screen in Singaporean Chinese with adequate psychometric properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, CLOX may aid as an adjunct in differentiating AD from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with a vascular element, e.g. AD with cerebrovascular disease and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
