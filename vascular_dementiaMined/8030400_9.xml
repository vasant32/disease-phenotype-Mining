<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As yet, no definitive biological antemortem marker has been established for differential diagnosis of AD or VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, proteins of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from AD, VD and control patients were analyzed by two-dimensional (2-D) electrophoresis with immobilized pH gradients in the first dimension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No specific changes for AD or VD could be detected in the 2-D CSF patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, a spot of haptoglobin alpha-1 chains (13.5 kDa; approximate pI 4.6) was found to be present in the majority of 2-D CSF maps from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases, suggesting a high-molecular-weight transudate type of alteration in the blood-brain barrier with considerable frequency in AD </plain></SENT>
