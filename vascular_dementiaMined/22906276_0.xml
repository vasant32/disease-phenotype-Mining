<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 15/group): sham operated controls (group A); focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> (group B); vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (group C); and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> treated with 20 mg/kg nimodipine daily (group D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> test evaluated learning and memory, and magnetic resonance perfusion-weighted imaging was used to measure rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal levels of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with group C, rats in group D demonstrated significantly improved learning ability and significantly increased hippocampal rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The levels of NF-��B, TNF-α and IL-1β were significantly lower in group D than in group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal nerve cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was abnormal in group C but near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in group D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nimodipine improved the symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, increased rCBF, reduced hippocampal cytokine levels and alleviated neuronal injury in the hippocampus of rats with experimental vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
