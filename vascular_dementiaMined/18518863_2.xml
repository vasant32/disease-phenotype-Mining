<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: (1) Meta-analysis of mortality data from double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials; and (2) recontact study to collect additional longer term mortality data from previous galantamine trial participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS (META-ANALYSIS): Across 12 trials (&lt; or =6 months duration), there was no increased risk of mortality associated with the use of galantamine (n = 4116) compared with that of placebo (n = 2386) (OR galantamine/placebo: 0.67, 95% CI 0.41-1.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS (RECONTACT STUDY): Median survival was 79 months for patients with AD (n = 478) and 59 months for patients with AD + <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> (n = 180) or VaD (n = 145) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prolonged galantamine treatment (&gt; vs &lt; or =6 months) was not associated with decreased survival time (75 vs 61 months respectively; P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analyses were consistent with the Kaplan-Meier analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found no short-term or longer term evidence of increased risk of mortality associated with the use of galantamine in patients with AD, AD + <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> or VaD </plain></SENT>
