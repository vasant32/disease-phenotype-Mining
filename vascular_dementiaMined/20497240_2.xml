<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Sensitive, specific neuropsychological screening tests, such as the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination Revised (ACE-R), are essential for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to validate the use of the Korean version of ACE-R (K-ACER) to differentiate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) from subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (SIVD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Standard tests for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> screening were applied to 156 subjects (84 controls, 30 AD, 42 SIVD), and total and sub-domain scores on the K-ACER, as well as the sub-domain ratio (VLOM), were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The reliability of the K-ACER was very good (Î±-coefficient 0.84), and cut-off score for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was determined (cut-off value 78, sensitivity 0.93, specificity 0.95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The likelihood ratio for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was calculated as between 78 and 82 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At a cut-off of 78, the likelihood of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 18.6:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although a comparison of K-ACER scores between AD and SIVD patients revealed significant differences in verbal fluency, language domain and VLOM ratio, sensitivity and specificity for differential diagnosis between AD and SVID proved less accurate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The K-ACER is a rapid, sensitive and specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> screening test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Though sub-domains of items may be useful for differentiating between AD and SIVD, sensitivity and specificity is less accurate than <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> screening itself </plain></SENT>
