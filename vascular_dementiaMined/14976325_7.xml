<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are major health problems in Chinese societies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> is a frequent cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only a few studies have been published on poststroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (PSDE), none of which has investigated a consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cohort in Asian patient populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to examine the prevalence and clinical correlates of PSDE in Chinese <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients in Hong Kong </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred eighty <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients consecutively admitted to the medical wards of a university-affiliated regional hospital were interviewed by a psychiatrist 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th edition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, a wide range of demographic and clinical variables were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-five participants (20%) had PSDE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis found that PSDE was associated with age; level of education; prestroke Rankin Scale score; prestroke Informant Questionnaire on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>Cognitive Decline</z:hpo> in the Elderly (IQCODE) score; National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) best language score, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> score, and total score; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo>; cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>; leukoaraiosis; bilateral lesions; number of lesions; involvement of middle cerebral artery circulation; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression suggested that prestroke IQCODE score, NIHSS total score, leukoaraiosis, involvement of middle cerebral artery territory, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> index were independent risk factors of PSDE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After removal of 22 patients with prestroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, which was defined as a prestroke IQCODE score &gt; or =4.0, the frequency of PSDE dropped to 15.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, involvement of the middle cerebral artery territory and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> index were replaced by level of education and bilateral lesions as independent predictors in the final logistic model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PSDE is common among Chinese <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients in Hong Kong </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Its frequency is comparable to that in white populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The clinical determinants of PSDE, after the exclusion of patients with prestroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, include premorbid level of cognitive function, severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, leukoaraiosis, level of education, and bilateral lesions </plain></SENT>
