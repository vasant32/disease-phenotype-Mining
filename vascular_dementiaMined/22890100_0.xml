<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate if microglial markers could differentiate, firstly between AD and controls, and secondly between stable mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) and those progressing to AD and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we investigated if these markers were sufficiently stable to be used in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We quantified YKL-40 and sCD14 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 96 AD patients, 65 healthy controls, and 170 patients with MCI from baseline and over 5.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the stability analysis, two CSF samples were collected from 52 AD patients with a six-month interval in between </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>YKL-40, but not sCD14, was significantly elevated in AD compared with healthy controls (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, YKL-40 and sCD14 were increased in MCI patients who converted to VaD (p = 0.029 and p = 0.008), but not to AD according to NINCDS-ADRDA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, when stratified according to CSF levels of tau and Aβ42, YKL-40 was elevated in those with an AD-indicative profile compared with stable MCI with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> profile (p = 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, YKL-40 and sCD14 were very stable in AD patients with good correlation between time-points (r = 0.94, p = 3.4 × 10-25; r = 0.77, p = 2.0 × 10-11) and the cortical damage marker T-tau </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, microglial markers are stable and may be used as safety markers for monitoring <z:mp ids='MP_0006082'>CNS inflammation</z:mp> and microglia activation in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, YKL-40 differentiates between AD and controls and between stable MCI to AD and those that convert to AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
