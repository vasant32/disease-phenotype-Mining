<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interest in using MRI parameters as surrogate markers of disease to assess therapies is increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> small vessel disease, we determined which MRI parameters best correlated with cognitive function on cross-sectional analysis and which changed over a period of 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-five patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and leukoaraiosis were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They underwent multimodal MRI (brain volume, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery lesion load, lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> number, fractional anisotropy, and mean diffusivity from diffusion tensor imaging) and neuropsychological testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven agreed to reattend for repeat MRI and neuropsychology at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An executive function score correlated most strongly with diffusion tensor imaging (fractional anisotropy histogram, r=-0.640, P=0.004) and brain volume (r=0.501, P=0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Associations with diffusion tensor imaging were stronger than with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other MRI parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On multiple regression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> imaging parameters, a model that contained brain volume and fractional anisotropy, together with age, gender, and premorbid IQ, explained 74% of the variance of the executive function score (P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Changes in mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy were detectable over the 1-year follow-up; in contrast, no change in other MRI parameters was detectable over this time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A multimodal MRI model explains a large proportion of the variation in executive function in cerebral small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In particular, diffusion tensor imaging correlates best with executive function and is the most sensitive to change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This supports the use of MRI, in particular diffusion tensor imaging, as a surrogate marker in treatment trials </plain></SENT>
