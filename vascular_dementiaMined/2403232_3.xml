<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in G4 AChE activity between serum and plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma AChE activity in control subjects (8-92 years) was independent of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum G4 AChE activity was significantly increased in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (P less than 0.01), compared with age-matched control, and significantly decreased in those with probable Alzheimer-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (P less than 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference between VD and ATD was significant (P less than 0.001), and thus the measurement of plasma or serum G4 AChE activity would be helpful in the differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
