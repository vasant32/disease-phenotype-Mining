<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although criteria for the diagnosis of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) are established, the diagnostic concept is still controversial and there is no regulatory guidance for clinical drug development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials in VaD present a number of pitfalls and challenges and, so far, no compound has received regulatory approval for this indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The methodological issues of clinical VaD trials are discussed using the development of memantine for this indication as an example </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a pooled analysis of two placebo-controlled trials with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> memantine in VaD, the cognitive benefit by memantine treatment was more pronounced for patients with 'small vessel disease' than for those with other neuroradiological findings at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a subgroup of patients with 'large vessel disease' or macrolesions, there was less <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> among the placebo patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It may therefore be helpful to use predefined diagnostic subcategories in clinical studies in this indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings further suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or multiple infarctions may not be the primary reason for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in VaD patients </plain></SENT>
