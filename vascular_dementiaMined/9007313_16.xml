<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore used demanding neuropsychologic testing and brain MRI to determine if elderly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> with at least one e4 allele demonstrate subclinical changes in cognition and a higher frequency of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> or silent ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study population consisted of 214 randomly selected individuals aged 50 to 75 years without neuropsychiatric or general disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 175 (81.8%) subjects without and 39 (18.2%) with at least one e4 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two groups were comparable for age, length of education, verbal intelligence, mood and major vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">Apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E e4 carriers performed significantly worse than non-carriers when assessed for learning and memory abilities, while there were no differences in test results of conceptualization, attention, speed of mental processing and visuopractical skills </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no between-group differences for thromboembolic and lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, white matter hyperintensity grading and the semiautomatically measured white matter hyperintensity area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The extent of sulcal and ventricular widening as well as hippocampal and parahippocampal volumes were also similar between the comparative subsets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E e4 allele is associated with subtle learning and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly persons and may therefore be suggested a marker for accelerated cognitive aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this group of subjects it was not associated with brain parenchymal changes as demonstrated by MRI </plain></SENT>
