<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective was to clarify to what extent dissolution of language in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is similar to that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both structured language tests (comprehension, repetition, reading, and naming tasks) and nonstructured language tests (object and picture description) were employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The structured tasks evidenced impairment on complex auditory comprehension and on picture naming for both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups, whereas oral reading and single word repetition did not differentiate the patients from matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the unstructured narrative tasks, both patient groups showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fluency, but content analysis revealed that the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> produced fewer semantic units (themes) than the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In summary, both patient groups showed impairment, specifically on semantically mediated language tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to the present results, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002463'>language impairment</z:hpo> in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> resembles that observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Semantically mediated functions are among the most sensitive language measures in differentiating early stages of both vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aging </plain></SENT>
