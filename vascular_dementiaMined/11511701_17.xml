<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether principal occupation during life is a risk factor for incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was carried out from the PAQUID (Personnes Ag√©es QUID) cohort, an epidemiological study on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathological aging after 65 years in the south west of France </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At baseline, 2950 non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> people living at home were identified and re-examined 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 years later with identical standardised neurological and neuropsychological measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards models with delayed entry were used, taking age as the time scale and adjusting for sex, education, tobacco, and wine consumption to estimate the risk ratio (RR) of incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> associated with occupational category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 2950 subjects, 393 became <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e>, of whom 251 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 112 had vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 27 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> was not related to a given occupation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> seemed to be increased in farmers in comparison with professionals and managerials, particularly among women (RR 7.47; 95%CI, 1.80-31.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The data suggest that occupation does not change the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, which seems to be more influenced by cognitive abilities in childhood and adolescence than by occupation in adult life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, being a farmer may increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> among women; occupation could act by the way of differences in health behaviour or in exposure to environmental factors </plain></SENT>
