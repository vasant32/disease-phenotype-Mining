<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and the pathologic role of glia are being elucidated, and epidemiologic studies have suggested potential protective value for <z:chebi fb="3" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="26519">free-radical</z:chebi> scavengers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, demonstrating disease-modifying drug effects for progressive conditions such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> can be a daunting task, fraught with clinical, statistical, and ethical dilemmas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To evaluate trial designs for demonstrating such effects, the International Working Group on Harmonization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Drug Guidelines (IWG) conducted a symposium at the Sixth International Congress on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> and Related Disorders, held July 1998 in Amsterdam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presentations at the IWG symposium covered the two basic designs currently being used in clinical trials, survival analysis and staggered-start/withdrawal, in addition to clinical data generated from the National Institute on Aging <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Cooperative Study vitamin E/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9086">selegiline</z:chebi> trial in patients with AD and the phase III clinical studies of propentofylline in patients with AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is hoped that this article will open a dialogue among investigators and regulatory authorities regarding appropriate trial designs to support a regulatory claim for disease-modifying effects </plain></SENT>
