<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hence, the effects of intranasal administration of GH loaded flexible liposomes have been investigated for the first time on the efficiency of acetylcholinesterase inhibition, as well as the pharmacokinetic behavior of GH in rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The GH loaded flexible liposomes were characterized for shape, entrapment capacity, size distribution and zeta potential by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultracentrifugation and dynamic light scattering (DLS), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of acetylcholinesterase was investigated using rat brain homogenates as an enzyme resource and microdialysis was used to determine the pharmacokinetic behavior of GH in rats brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo> PC-12 cell line was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of GH loaded flexible liposomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results revealed that: (i) the efficiency of acetylcholinesterase inhibition of GH was greatly enhanced by intranasal administration compared with oral administration, especially GH loaded in flexible liposomes; (ii) the C(max) and AUC(0â†’10) for intranasal administration of GH loaded flexible liposomes were 3.52 and 3.36 times higher than those of orally administered GH, moreover, the T(max) was greatly shortened from 1.5h for oral administration to 0.75h for intranasal administration of GH loaded flexible liposomes; and (iii) PC-12 cells viability tests showed that the flexible liposome carrier is not toxic to the cultured cells and the cytotoxicity of GH to cells was clearly decreased by loading in flexible liposomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that intranasal administration of GH loaded flexible liposomes could readily transport GH into brain tissues, suggesting some promise for this approach in successful brain-drug targeting in AD treatment </plain></SENT>
