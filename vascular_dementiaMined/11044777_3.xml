<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A growing body of evidence points out the potential role of inflammatory mechanisms in the pathophysiology of brain damage in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently demonstrated that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) display an intrathecal production of proinflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha, one of these cytokines, leads to the production of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO), a potent inflammatory mediator, by induction of inducible NO synthase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the intrathecal levels of nitrate, one of the main metabolites of NO, and to relate its levels to the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>intellectual impairment</z:hpo>, in patients with AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients with early AD and 26 patients with VaD were analyzed with respect to cerebrospinal fluid levels of nitrate by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in patients with AD but not VaD, the intrathecal levels of nitrate were significantly and inversely correlated (r = -0.68, p = 0.002) to the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>intellectual impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrates an inverse correlation between the intrathecal levels of nitrate and the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in patients with AD, suggesting a neuroprotective effect of NO in AD </plain></SENT>
