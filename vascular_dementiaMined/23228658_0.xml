<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Decreased plasma levels of sLRP and sRAGE in patients with AD have been documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, whether different levels of these proteins can differentiate AD from other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> has not been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study we assessed the concentrations of these two proteins in 126 patients with AD, 96 with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), 30 with non-AD neurodegenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> (NND) and 98 cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (NC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma sLRP was significantly lower in the group with AD compared with any of the other three groups (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity of sLRP was 77.8% for AD, whereas specificity was 93.3% for NND, 85.7% for the NC and 58.3% for those with VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma sRAGE showed a significantly lower concentration in the group with AD compared with those in the VaD or NC group, but there were no significant differences between the AD compared to the NND group or the VaD compared to the NND group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity of sRAGE was 82.5% for patients with AD, whereas specificity was 53.5% for NND, 73.5% for the NC group and 43.8% for those with VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The receiving operator characteristic analysis of combined sLRP and sRAGE showed a higher diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.84-0.93) than that of either sLRP or sRAGE considered singly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results support the possibility that these two biomarkers may help with the diagnosis of AD </plain></SENT>
