<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and cerebrovascular disease also often coexist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to determine the nature of the cerebrovascular lesions that are most significant in producing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These were analyzed in a group of cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in which only vascular pathology was present and, in particular, no more than trivial amounts of Alzheimer-type pathology were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cerebrovascular lesions in this group of cases were compared with those in a group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases who were nondemented and a group of elderly cases without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Severe cribriform change and deep white/grey matter micro-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were significantly more common in the test group than in either of the control groups, whereas single macroscopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were more common in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> control group than either of the other two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, microvascular deep white and grey matter lesions, but not macroscopic infarction, were significant in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of this study will be discussed in relation to the view that microvascular lesions may also contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in subjects with more extensive Alzheimer-type pathology and thus lower the threshold at which Alzheimer-type pathology becomes clinically manifest </plain></SENT>
