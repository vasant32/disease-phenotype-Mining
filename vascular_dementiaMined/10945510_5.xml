<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study examined the efficacy of naftidrofuryl in patients with vascular or mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This multicenter, randomized, double-blind study compared naftidrofuryl 600 mg/d with placebo for 1 year in patients with vascular or mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A preliminary 2-month washout period allowed selection of patients who were compliant with treatment </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant improvements in cognitive and global function were observed in patients receiving naftidrofuryl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Naftidrofuryl was well tolerated, and produced no clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that naftidrofuryl is effective and well tolerated in treating the symptoms of vascular and mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
