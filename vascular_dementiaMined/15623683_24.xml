<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms in GSTO1 might influence the function of the protein and thus the risk of AD, VaD, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The GSTO1 gene was screened for variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of the detected polymorphisms on the risk of AD, VaD, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSF levels of cholesterol and plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels were compared according to the GSTO1 genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two missense polymorphisms in exon 4 of GSTO1 (Ala140Asp and Glu155DeltaGlu) were detected and tested for their association with AD, VaD, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Asp/Asp and Ala/Asp genotypes increased the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (p = 0.003, OR = 2.1), and the Asp/Asp genotype increased the risk of VaD (p = 0.02, OR = 2.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GSTO1 polymorphisms did not influence the risk of AD, but the Asp allele influenced the age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In nondemented probands CSF levels of cholesterol were increased in carriers of the Asp/Asp genotype (p = 0.004); however, in patients with manifest <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> the authors found decreased CSF levels of cholesterol in carriers of the Asp/Asp genotype (p = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were higher in carriers of at least one Asp allele (p = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The GSTO1 Asp allele may be a genetic risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases, and might influence the course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, even though effects vary in different studies </plain></SENT>
