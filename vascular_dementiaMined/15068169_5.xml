<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to compare the etiopathogenesis of BD of the aged (aged-BD) with that of classic-BD, with the aid of morphometry of the arterial medial thickness and reconstruction of the cerebral medullary arteries using serial sections from five autopsy cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The age range of the aged-BD cases was 73-89 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean heart weight of these cases was 296 g, in contrast to 391 g of the five age-matched cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> without diffuse myelin loss and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the cerebral white matter (HT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although significant medial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the subarachnoid and medullary arteries was not found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aged-BD cases, differently from classic-BD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five cases of aged-BD commonly presented significantly widespread loss of the medial smooth muscle cells (SMC) of the medullary arteries as compared with HT, similar to the case in classic-BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The etiopathogenesis of aged-BD is common to that of classic-BD; stiffening caused by hypertensive changes of the medullary artery, especially SMC loss, is responsible for the diffuse myelin loss and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the cerebral white matter of BD, rather than grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> itself or hypertensive medial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As the mechanism of such an especially severe involvement of the cerebral medullary artery in BD, some genetic abnormality in the functional response or vulnerability to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> of the artery should be considered </plain></SENT>
