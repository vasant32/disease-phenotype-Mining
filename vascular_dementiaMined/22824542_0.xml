<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are considered as an expression of small vessel disease on MRI, next to lacunes and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microbleeds are relatively common in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, with reported prevalences between 35% and 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the context of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, microbleeds are mainly thought to result from hypertensive vasculopathy, but the frequent co-occurrence of lobar microbleeds suggests that neurodegenerative pathology and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> is also of importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of multiple microbleeds in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> is related to worse performance on cognitive tests, mainly in psychomotor speed and executive functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They may have some predictive value in terms of predicting development of (vascular) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, mortality and disability </plain></SENT>
