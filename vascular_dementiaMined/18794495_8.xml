<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report a new American family with hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0006994'>diffuse leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> with spheroids (HDLS), including serial, presymptomatic and symptomatic, cranial MRIs from the proband </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report clinical and genealogic investigations of an HDLS family, sequential brain MRIs of the proband, and autopsy slides of brain tissue from the proband's father </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified seven affected family members (five deceased) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age at symptomatic disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 35 years (range: 20-57), and the mean disease duration was 16 years (range: 3-46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five affected individuals initially manifested <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory disturbance</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral changes</z:hpo>, whereas two experienced a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0525045" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mood disorder</z:e> as their presenting symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our proband's father had been diagnosed clinically with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, but his brain autopsy was consistent with HDLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proband had a cranial MRI prior to symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, with two subsequent MRIs performed during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These serial images reveal a progressive, confluent, frontal-predominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> with symmetric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The proband of our newly identified hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0006994'>diffuse leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> with spheroids (HDLS) kindred had subtle evidence of an incipient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> on a presymptomatic cranial MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conceivably, MRI may facilitate identifying affected presymptomatic individuals within known HDLS kindreds, increasing the likelihood of isolating the causative genes </plain></SENT>
