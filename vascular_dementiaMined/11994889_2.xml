<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Neuropsychology can be useful for differentiating patients with fronto-temporal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (FTD) from those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) and those with Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was twofold: to explore possible employment of the Ten-Point Clock Test in early identification of different types of cognitive distribution and to relate to its execution to other specific impairment, bound to the selected pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We compared 30 patients with FLD, to a group of 30 probable-AD patients accordingly to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, and to a group of 30 probable VaD patients, according to the NINDS-AIREN criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AD group showed the worst results in Clock Drawing Test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, FLD group did produce the worst performances in Proverb Interpretation Tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VaD worst performance was that of phonological fluency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data seem to demonstrate that in mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, stated by the MMSE score (around 22) and confirmed by the data derived from the other neuropsychological evaluation, the Clock Drawing Test is quite sensitive to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, even if of different origins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ten-Point Clock Test is a strong tool, in order to identify early forms of Alzheimer, and to help differential diagnosis when frontal or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> have been taken into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More data will be necessary to give to this speculative interpretation, a neuroimaging and neuroanatomical support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, this report may encourage the wider use of this parametric test, easily applicable and well accepted by the population in order to implement data concerning cognitive disruption </plain></SENT>
