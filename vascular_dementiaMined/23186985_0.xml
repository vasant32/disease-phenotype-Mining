<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite its prevalence, the genetic etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> VCI is largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a systematic review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> published genetic association studies of forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> VCI prior to 6 July 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An initial pool of 229 gene association studies yielded 104 papers (72 polymorphisms from 47 genes) that met inclusion criteria for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systematic meta-analysis was conducted on 6 polymorphisms (which had 3 or more published case-control cohorts from 69 papers) in the APOE, ACT, ACE, MTHFR, PON1, and PSEN-1 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associations of increased risk for VCI were found for APOE ε4 (1.818 (95% CI = 1.611-2.053), p ≤ 0.001; n = 3,554 cases, n = 12,277 controls) and MTHFR rs1801133 (1.323 (95% CI = 1.061-1.650) p = 0.013); n = 659 cases, n = 981 controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was marginal evidence of a protective effect for APOE ε2 (0.885 (95% CI = 0.783-0.999), p = 0.048; n = 3,320 cases, n = 10,786 controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This systematic study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> published genetic association studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> VCI supports MTHFR and APOE as susceptibility genes for VCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It also shows the utility of meta-analysis as a tool to identify potential candidate genes from numerous individual small-scale studies of diseases where sample recruitment may be limited for a variety of practical reasons </plain></SENT>
