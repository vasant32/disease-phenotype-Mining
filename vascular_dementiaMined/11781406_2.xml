<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the rates of cognitive and functional decline in African American patients diagnosed at baseline with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) (n = 79), AD (n = 113), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (SWD) (n = 56) and followed for up to 7 years with annual neuropsychological and other examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Study patients were diagnosed using established criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and were administered cognitive screening, functional screening, and neuropsychological measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity was rated using the Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Random effects modeling was used to examine rates of decline and to compare the rates of decline in the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both patients with VaD and those with AD showed significant cognitive and functional decline during follow-up; patients with VaD declined at a slower rate than patients with AD; and patients diagnosed with SWD at baseline did not show cognitive or functional decline during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with VaD decline at a slower rate than patients with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who do not meet criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> soon after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may not be at high risk for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Future studies are needed to follow VaD patients with longitudinal, specialized <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> protocols, concurrent neuropsychological examinations, and neuropathologic examination to determine possible neuroimaging predictors of progressive cognitive and functional decline and to assess the contribution of Alzheimer's pathology to decline in patients diagnosed with VaD </plain></SENT>
