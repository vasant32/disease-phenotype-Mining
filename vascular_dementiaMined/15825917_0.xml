<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We compared the performance of 40 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000727'>frontal lobe dementia</z:hpo> to that of 40 patients with subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (80 patients including, 46 men and 34 women) in a set of tasks assessing attentional, executive, and behavioural tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000727'>frontal lobe dementia</z:hpo> represents an important cause for degenerative disruption and is increasingly recognised as an important form (up to 25%) of degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> among individuals of late-middle-age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main involvement is the frontal-subcortical pathway, which is the final target of impairment even in subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A wider involvement of the cortical (decisional) layers in frontal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, in contrast with the prominent and widespread involvement of the subcortical pathways (refinement and corrections programs) creates the different profiles of the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Frontal patients have more difficulties in abstract reasoning, focusing attention, and implementing strategies to solve problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They exhibit more profound behavioural alterations in personality and social conduct and show only moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and a total <z:hpo ids='HP_0000757'>lack of insight</z:hpo> concerning their dinical condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the patients with subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> have poor general cognitive functions, high insight, and important <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo> as the principal and most salient characteristic of their behavioral conduct </plain></SENT>
