<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association of two putative functional CETP polymorphisms (C-629A and I405V) with the risk of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) and tested if this association is influenced by the presence of APOE4 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study included 163 VD patients (mean age: 74.25 +/- 7.9 years) and 452 cognitively healthy probands (mean age: 70.81 +/- 7.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a biological correlate, the association of CETP gene variants with white matter lesion (WML) load was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither the C-629A (P = 0.169) nor the I405V (P = 0.840) polymorphism was associated with VD risk in the whole sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in non-carriers of the APOE4 allele, homozygote carriers of the CETP C-629A A allele presented with an increased risk of VD (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whereas in APOE4 carriers, no association of CETP polymorphisms with VD risk was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, carriers of the CETP C-629A AA genotype presented with decreased WML load in the frontal brain (P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that CETP gene polymorphisms might influence WML load and the risk of VD, the latter in non-carriers of the APOE4 allele </plain></SENT>
