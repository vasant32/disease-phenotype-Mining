<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Inflammatory mechanisms and immune activation have been hypothesized to play a role in the pathogenesis of age-associated diseases, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The evaluation of inflammatory markers in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and to determine whether these markers can be used to differentiate between vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) and Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients (10 AD and 10 VD) and 20 non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> controls were subjected to clinical evaluation, MRI brain scans and laboratory tests, including interleukin (IL) 6, C-reactive protein and serum protein electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results of this study revealed that serum levels of IL-6 and C-reactive protein were significantly elevated among patients with both types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the mean IL-6 level was higher in patients with AD compared to patients with VD, this difference was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cutoff value at which the serum level of IL-6 gave maximum sensitivity and specificity was 14.25 pg/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, α₁- and α₂-globulins were able to discriminate between AD and VD (being significantly higher in AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IL-6 levels could be used to differentiate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, α₁- and α₂-globulins could differentiate between AD and VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It can be concluded that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> plays an important role in both types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
