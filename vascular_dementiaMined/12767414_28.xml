<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have suggested the clinical efficacy of Ginkgo in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, cerebral insufficiency, or related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, most of these studies did not fulfill the current methodologic requirements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed the efficacy of the G. biloba special extract EGb 761 in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and age-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> in relation to dose and duration of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our study was a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Study participants were elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) or age-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> (AAMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 214 participants, recruited from 39 homes for the elderly in the Netherlands, were randomly allocated to Ginkgo (either 240 mg/d or 160 mg/d) or placebo (0 mg/d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 12 weeks, the subjects in the two Ginkgo groups were randomized to continued Ginkgo treatment or placebo treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome measures in this study were the Syndrome Kurz Test (SKT; psychometric functioning), the Clinical Global Impression of change (CGI-2; psychopathology, assessed by nursing staff), and the Nuremberg Gerontopsychological Rating Scale for Activities of Daily Living (NAI-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>; behavioral functioning) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One hundred twenty-three patients received Ginkgo (n=79, 240 and 160 mg/d combined) or placebo (n=44) during the 24-week intervention period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found no statistically significant differences in mean change of scores between Ginkgo and placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The differences were SKT: +0.4 (90% confidence interval [CI] -0.9-1.7); CGI-2: +0.1 (90% CI -0.3-0.4), and NAI-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>: -0.4 (90% CI -1.9-1.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A positive difference is in favor of Ginkgo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Neither the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subgroup (n=36) nor the AAMI subgroup (n=87) experienced a significant effect of Ginkgo treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was no dose-effect relationship and no effect of prolonged Ginkgo treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The trial results do not support the view that Ginkgo is beneficial for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or age-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
