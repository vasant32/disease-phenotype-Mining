<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Longitudinal, prospective study with follow-up at 4 and 8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Community settings in Oxfordshire, UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: 97 elderly people with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (in many cases confirmed by postmortem examination) and who were living at home with a carer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASURES: Each subject's behaviour was assessed in detail at each interview using the Present Behavioural Examination to assess subject's behaviour over the preceding 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventeen key behaviour items which were both common and clinically important were selected for further analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three syndromes were identified: (a) overactivity (walking more, walking aimlessly, trailing the carer or checking where the carer was); (b) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behaviour</z:hpo> (physical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo>, aggressive resistance, verbal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo>); (c) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000709'>psychosis</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, persecutory ideas and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000738'>hallucinations</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The same syndromes were found using data collected at three different time points and by using a variety of statistical techniques, confirming their robustness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overactivity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behaviour</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000709'>psychosis</z:hpo> form three distinct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0349251" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">behavioural syndromes</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
