<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To further clarify the cognitive syndrome in subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), we investigated 20 patients with early-stage VaD as compared with 30 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and 22 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls using episodic memory, attention/executive function and language tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient groups were closely matched in terms of age, education and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The VaD patients had a significantly better free recall, cued recall and recognition memory than AD patients, the recognition being within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits in VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, VaD patients had a greater number of perseverative errors during the Modified Card Sorting test, while AD patients exhibited more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233651" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">perseverations</z:e> of semantic fluency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of retrieval deficit syndrome and increased number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233651" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">perseverations</z:e> during tasks sensitive to frontal lobe function are in agreement with the studies emphasizing the importance of frontal dysfunction in subcortical VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings are relevant for the early diagnosis of VaD and might be useful in the differential diagnosis with AD </plain></SENT>
