<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compared brief cognitive tests and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in predicting conversion from mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) to AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: At a memory clinic, 133 patients with MCI were followed until development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or until they had been stable over a mean period of 5.9 years (range 3.2-8.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the clock drawing test, total tau, tau phosphorylated at Thr(181) (P-tau) and amyloid-β(1-42) (Aβ(42)) were assessed at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During clinical follow-up, 47% remained cognitively stable and 53% developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, with an incidence of 13.8%/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the group that developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> the prevalence of AD was 73.2%, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> 14.1%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>) 5.6%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSNP1">progressive supranuclear palsy</z:e> (PSP) 4.2%, semantic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> 1.4% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006118" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain tumour</z:e> 1.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When predicting subsequent development of AD among patients with MCI, the cognitive tests classified 81% of the cases correctly (AUC, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.77-0.90) and CSF biomarkers 83% (AUC, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82-0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combination of cognitive tests and CSF (AUC, 0.93; 95% CI 0.87 to 0.96) was significantly better than the cognitive tests (p = 0.01) and the CSF biomarkers (p = 0.04) alone when predicting AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The MMSE and the clock drawing test were as accurate as CSF biomarkers in predicting future development of AD in patients with MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Combining both instruments provided significantly greater accuracy than cognitive tests or CSF biomarkers alone in predicting AD </plain></SENT>
