<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors compared the efficacy and tolerability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">haloperidol</z:chebi> in the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (BPSD) in institutionalized elderly Korean patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, or mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was an 18-week double-blind, crossover study involving 120 patients who were randomly assigned to receive flexible doses (0.5-1.5 mg/day) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">haloperidol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BPSD were assessed using the Korean version of the Behavioral Pathology in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD-K), the Korean version of the Cohen-Mansfield <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>Agitation</z:hpo> Inventory (CMAI-K), and the Clinical Global Impression of Change scale (CGI-C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Safety and tolerability assessments included the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale and the incidence of adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">haloperidol</z:chebi> were efficacious in alleviating BPSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, when receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi>, patients showed significantly greater improvement than when receiving <z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">haloperidol</z:chebi> in the total and subscale scores of the BEHAVE-AD-K, the total and subscale scores of the CMAI-K, and the scores on the CGI-C scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> had an additional benefit on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxieties</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0349231" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">phobias</z:e> </plain></SENT>
