<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined neurogenesis in small vessel disease, a key concurrent pathology in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We assayed autopsy tissue from 13 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients with small vessel disease and 12 age-matched subjects without cerebrovascular pathology, undertaking immunohistochemistry in the affected brain area and the subventricular zone with a well-characterized battery of antibodies to detect neural stem cells/progenitors and immature neurones, as well as <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We showed significant increases ranging from 33% to 92% (P &lt; 0.05) in neural progenitor cells around the areas of microvascular pathology and in the subventricular zone in patients with small vessel disease compared to individuals without cerebrovascular changes, even in patients with severe cerebrovascular disease, as defined by neuropathological assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some of the progenitor cells give rise to immature neurones in the affected areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These alterations were associated with vascular changes, but were unrelated to the cholinergic deficit observed in the cortex and subventricular zone in these patients, in contrast to other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> examined such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence for neurogenesis in small vessel disease and may have important implications for the development of new therapies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
