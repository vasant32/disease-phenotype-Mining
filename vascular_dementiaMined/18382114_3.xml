<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the age-, sex-, and subtype-specific incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and to assess the effect of education level on the incidence in a Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 2,286 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-free subjects, aged &gt; or =60 years, were followed for 5.9 years through biennial two-phase examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 206 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were newly diagnosed based on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence per 1,000 person-years was 12.0 for men and 16.6 for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, 80 cases of probable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) and 50 cases of possible AD were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on NINDS-AIREN criteria, 36 cases of probable vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) and 40 cases of possible VaD were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age and education showed the most statistically significant effects for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Probable AD showed the most remarkable increase with age and decreased with increasing education level (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Probable VaD showed significant effects of sex (p = 0.033) and sex-age interaction (p = 0.048), but not education (p = 0.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: AD was the predominant type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in this recent incidence study conducted in Japan, suggesting a reduction in VaD and an increase in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age, sex, and education effects differed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
