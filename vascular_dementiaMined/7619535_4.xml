<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To provide a preliminary assessment of the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and its subtypes in a rural area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From a total of 2,469 people over 65 who were not committed to any institution, 273 were randomly chosen and stratified by age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these 273 individuals, 244 (89.4%) took part in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Family doctors administered the miniexamen cognoscitivo (MEC), a Spanish version of the Mini Mental State Exam to screen <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals taking part in the first phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Enrolled in the second phase were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> those whose scores on the MEC were below the cut-off point, plus a similar number of individuals whose scores were above this level and who were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CAMDEX was the instrument used for diagnosis by clinical psychologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the area under study was 13.93 +/- 4.34% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This prevalence includes the three levels of diagnosis certainty for CAMDEX (definitive, probable and possible) and the three levels of severity (minimum, mild, moderate, and severe) defined by the instrument </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> increased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Females showed more <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> than males in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> by subtypes was 41.18% for both Alzheimer's type senile and presenile forms, and for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 17.64% for mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results show a prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> that is higher than rates observed in other studies using similar materials and methods </plain></SENT>
