<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To identify predictors of activity of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activity of daily living (IADL) decline in a population with subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>) and to evaluate potential mechanism of decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Longitudinal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Hospital-based </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Computed tomographic (CT) scanning identified 77 participants as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Participants were neurologically, neuropsychologically, behaviorally, and functionally assessed four times over 5.82 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline data were grouped into four modules: basic demographic and risk factor, CT scan, neurological and other clinical, and neuropsychological and behavioral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis determined predictors of decline in ADLs and IADLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Predictors of ADL decline were age, alcohol consumption, coordination, snout reflex, and performance on a neuropsychological test (Block Design) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Predictors of IADL decline were predominantly cognitive and included the presence of paratonia and performance on the two neuropsychological tests (attention and memory tasks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> are most likely to have an effect on IADL function, because the skills involved are complex and involve integrative activity, whereas physical and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> combined are likely to compromise ADL function, given the more basic and physical nature of the functions involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that in people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>, both ADL and IADL status should be monitored, because, for many, decline in function over time is likely, and thus the provision of appropriate support required </plain></SENT>
