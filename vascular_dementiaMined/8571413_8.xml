<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: High insulin levels are a recognized risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microvascular endothelium is more susceptible to metabolic and mitogenic effects of insulin than large-vessel endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Besides their atherogenic effect, high insulin levels impair fibrinolysis by enhancing plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We undertook this study to evaluate the hypothesis that elevated serum insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels are related to cerebral small-vessel disease rather than large-vessel pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred ninety-four consecutive patients presenting with symptomatic cerebrovascular disease were assigned to three subgroups that were differentiated by clinical presentations, brain imaging studies, and extracranial as well as transcranial vascular ultrasound findings: (1) patients with lacunes (n = 20), (2) patients with subcortical arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (n = 35), and (3) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> due to large-vessel disease (n = 99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who had suffered a cryptogenic (n = 9) or cardioembolic (n = 16) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or who showed characteristics of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096293" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">macroangiopathy</z:e> groups (n = 15) were not further evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients without manifestations of cerebrovascular disease were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels were determined in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences in age or sex among the three groups and control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Insulin levels were significantly higher in the lacunar group compared with the subcortical arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> group, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096293" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">macroangiopathy</z:e> group, and the control patients (median [interquartile range]: 103.8 [198.6], 72.0 [103.2], 66.0 [57.0], and 52.2 [57.0] pmol/L, respectively; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; .05, Mann-Whitney test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant difference in insulin concentrations between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> group (subcortical arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> and lacunes) and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096293" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">macroangiopathy</z:e> and control groups (81.0 [110.4], 66.0 [57.0], and 55.2 [57.0] pmol/L, respectively; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; .05, Mann-Whitney) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The same was true for the distribution of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels and to a minor extent blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values, but these differences failed to reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated insulin levels potentially represent a pathogenetic factor in the development of cerebral small-vessel disease, predominantly in patients presenting with lacunes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Whether this is due solely to atherosclerotic changes of the small penetrating arteries or whether changes in hemorheology are operative as well remains to be evaluated </plain></SENT>
