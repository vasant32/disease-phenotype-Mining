<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In eight of 13 of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases strongly immunostained deposits of plasma proteins were observed around numerous capillaries of layers I-IV of frontal grey matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each of these deposits contained albumin, prealbumin, IgG, C1q, C3c, and fibrinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No such deposits were found in any of the seven non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> aged controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in white matter in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aged control cases only weak immunostaining of serum proteins was observed which gradually decreased with the distance from the vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of heavy deposits of serum proteins exclusively around the capillaries of the gray matter in cases with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> may indicate a defect of the cortical capillary system which might play a role in the clinical symptoms seen in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The enrichment of C1q within the deposits is intriguing as this might occur because of the binding of C1 through its subunit C1q to the antibody-antigen complex and thereby support a possible immunologic involvement in the formation of these deposits </plain></SENT>
