<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: In 77 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 42 controls, thyrotropin (TSH) and thyroid antibodies were correlated with the different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and the metabolic index (MI) based on imaging with F-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4167">D-glucose</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (FDG-PET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-two of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (29%) had borderline (TSH 0.3-0.5 mU/l) or <z:mp ids='MP_0005134'>decreased TSH levels</z:mp> (TSH &lt; 0.3 mU/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TSH values were significantly lower in patients suffering from AD (median: 1.1 mU/l) and VD (0.5 mU/l) than in the control group (1.5 mU/l) (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Decreased or borderline TSH levels were present in 52% of the patients with VD, but in only 10% of the controls, and in 23% of the patients with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to thyroid peroxidase were positive in 16% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The MI in patients suffering from AD with borderline TSH levels was 0.81 (0.70, 0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, patients suffering from AD with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> TSH values showed a slightly higher MI of 0.84 (0.76, 0.89) (p = n.s.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Decreased or borderline TSH values are associated with an increased probability of having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, especially VD </plain></SENT>
