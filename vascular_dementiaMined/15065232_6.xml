<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Korean version of the Cohen-Mansfield <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>Agitation</z:hpo> Inventory (CMAI-K) was administered to a total of 257 elderly with AD or VaD in a nursing home in Seoul, Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three kinds of reliability and criterion validity were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Factor analysis using principal component analysis with the varimax rotation was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To identify different patterns of agitated behaviours, multiple logistic regression analysis was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This study demonstrated satisfactory reliability and validity for the CMAI-K as an instrument measuring <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> in Korean <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> sufferers in nursing homes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighty-three percent of the subjects manifested one or more agitated behaviours at least once a week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Factor analysis yielded four subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo>: physically <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behaviours</z:hpo>, physically nonaggressive behaviours, verbally agitated behaviours, and hiding/hoarding behaviours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the CMAI-K is a reliable and valid instrument to measure agitated behaviours in Korean elderly with AD or VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results validate and expand previous research on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and guide in the development of interventions </plain></SENT>
