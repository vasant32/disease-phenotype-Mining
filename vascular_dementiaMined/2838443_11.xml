<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventy-seven percent of patients had PBI and of these, 22% developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e> after a median time of 11 months post treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The brain was the apparent unique initial site of relapse in 10% of PBI cases but more commonly brain relapse was preceded or accompanied by failure at other sites, especially the chest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Brain metastases</z:e> were the greatest cause of morbidity in 50% of PBI failures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve of 14 PBI patients alive 2 years after treatment had oncologic, neurologic, and neuropsychological evaluation, and brain CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> long-term survivors were capable of self care and none fulfilled diagnostic criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, with three borderline cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One third had pretreatment neurologic dysfunction and two thirds post treatment neurologic symptoms, most commonly recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent had subtle motor findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intellectual functioning was at the 38th percentile with most patients having an unskilled occupational history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychologic impairment ratings were borderline in three cases and definitely impaired in seven cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CT scans showed brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with mild progression in those having a pre-treatment baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Periventricular and subcortical low density lesions identical to the CT appearance of subcortical arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> were seen in 82% of posttreatment CT studies, and lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in 54% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychologic impairment scores and the extent of CT periventricular low density lesions were strongly associated (rank correlation 0.7, p less than .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Overall, PBI after intensive combination chemotherapy did not induce gross <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or neurologic dysfunction but its risk/benefit ratio is not overwhelmingly favorable, with failure to prevent brain relapse in 1/5 patients and subtle but detectable motor findings and neuropsychologic impairment in the majority </plain></SENT>
