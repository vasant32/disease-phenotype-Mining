<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to estimate the impact of the introduction of propentofylline, a glial-cell modulator with neuroprotective properties, on the costs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> care in Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To estimate the clinical effects of propentofylline treatment on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, we conducted a meta-analysis of four double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials and a simulation in a cohort of 57,000 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This cohort represented the fraction of the total AD and VaD population in Sweden with mild-to-moderate disease, the target population for propentofylline treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rate of progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was expressed in terms of the annual rate of change in score on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The costs of care were estimated on the basis of a prospective population-based study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A regression model was used to quantify the costs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> care as a function of MMSE score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The estimates obtained were used to calculate and compare the costs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> care until <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, with or without propentofylline treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of the results to a variety of model assumptions was also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The total gross cost for 9 years under the current treatment strategy was SEK (Swedish kronor) 168.06 billion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Including propentofylline in the treatment strategy yielded net savings of SEK 0.8 billion, since the savings in the cost of patient care outweighed the drug acquisition costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Over 9 years, this saving represents 3.8% of the costs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> care in the target population (MMSE score, 15-25 points) and 0.5% of the costs in the total AD and VaD population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The annual savings per patient ranged from SEK 5517 to 6387 during the first 4 years of propentofylline treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>If an extended neuroprotective effect of propentofylline is assumed, savings increase to SEK 1.6 billion, equivalent to 7.6% of total care costs in the target population and 1.0% in the total population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Savings increase to SEK 14.6 billion if the extended neuro-protective effect is assumed to be effective in an extended target population (MMSE score, 0-25 points) without increased survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the sensitivity analysis, most scenarios yielded benefits in favor of propentofylline treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The clinical effects of propentofylline translate into meaningful economic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The drug acquisition costs are more than offset by the savings achieved in the cost of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The inclusion of a broader range of outcomes may increase these savings </plain></SENT>
