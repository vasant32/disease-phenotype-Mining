<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate here that administration of human recombinant HGF (hrHGF) into the ventricle reduced the prolongation of the escape latency in the acquisition and retention tests in the water maze task on days 12-28 after microsphere embolism-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, disruption of the blood-brain barrier at the early stage after microsphere embolism, which was determined by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-albumin leakage, was markedly reduced by treatment with hrHGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that this effect of hrHGF on the blood-brain barrier was associated with protection against the apoptotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of the cerebral endothelial cells at the early stage after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
