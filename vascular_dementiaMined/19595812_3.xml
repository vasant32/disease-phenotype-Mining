<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) has a cognitive prodrome, akin to the mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) prodrome to Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate whether VaD has a cognitive prodrome, and if it can be differentiated from prodromal AD, we examined neuropsychological test performance of participants in a nested case-control study within a population-based cohort aged 65 or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants (n = 485) were identified from the Cache County Study, a large population-based study of aging and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After an average of 3 years of follow-up, a total of 62 incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases were identified (14 VaD, 48 AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified a number of neuropsychological tests (executive and memory) that discriminated between diagnosed VaD and AD cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses sought to differentiate between these same groups 3 years before clinical diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Consortium to Establish a Registry for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Word List Recognition Test correct recognition of foils (mean difference, 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42 to 2.07; p &lt; 0.01), Logical Memory I (mean difference, 7.16; 95% CI, 0.78 to 13.55, p &lt; 0.05), Logical Memory II delayed recall (mean difference, 8.67; 95% CI, 1.59 to 15.74, p &lt; 0.05), and percent savings (mean difference, 51.07; 95% CI, 32.58 to 69.56, p &lt; 0.0001) differentiated VaD from AD cases after adjustment for age, sex, education, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three years before <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnosis, word list recognition ("no" responses mean difference, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.64 to 2.17; p &lt; 0.001, and "yes" responses mean difference, -1.14; 95% CI, -2.14 to -0.13; p &lt; 0.03) discriminated between prodromal VaD and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that VaD has a prodromal syndrome, the cognitive features of which are distinguishable from the cognitive prodrome of AD </plain></SENT>
