<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors consecutively included patients attending their memory clinic between January 2002 and April 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They analyzed prevalence and number of MBs according to demographic, diagnostic, and MRI data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The authors included 772 patients (53% men, age 66 +/- 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred twenty-seven patients (17%) exhibited at least one MB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence differed according to diagnostic groups (p &lt; 0.0001): Sixty-five percent of patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> exhibited MBs vs 18% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> patients, 20% of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> patients, and 10% of patients with subjective complaints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of MBs was associated with age, white matter hyperintensities, lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of microbleeds (MBs) in a large cohort of patients attending a memory clinic is higher than previously described in community samples and lower than reported in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding of a relatively high proportion of MBs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> provides further evidence for the involvement of vascular factors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
