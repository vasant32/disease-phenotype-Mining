<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">Apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (ApoE) gene polymorphism as a risk factor in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> has been suggested, but direct evidence from genetic association studies remains inconclusive even in Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis in order to evaluate the relationship between ApoE gene polymorphism and susceptibility to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in Chinese population by pooling data from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> relevant case-control studies published domestically and abroad from January 1990 to May 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>18 case-control studies were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis results showed that the pooled OR value of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subjects in Chinese population with ε4 allele carriers was 2.07 [95% CI (1.69, 2.53)], and the pooled OR value of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subjects with E4/E4 genotype was 3.34 [95% CI (1.89, 5.88)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that ApoE polymorphism is significantly associated with susceptibility to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The subject with at least one ε4 allele or E4/E4 genotype has higher risk suffering from vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> than others </plain></SENT>
