<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors tested whether bright light therapy (BLT) is capable of improving cognitive functions in patients with Alzheimer-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD) or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-three patients with AD or VD were randomly assigned to either evening BLT or dim light therapy (DLT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Effects of light therapy on cognitive functions were assessed before and after light therapy using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Body temperature rhythm (BTR) was additionally recorded pre- and posttreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Irrespective of their diagnosis, patients treated with BLT (p =.0012) but not with DLT (p =.73) showed a statistically significant increase in MMSE total scores after light therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evening BLT simultaneously induced a significant phase delay of 56 min on BTR (p =.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results suggest that short-term evening BLT may exert beneficial effects on cognitive functioning in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
