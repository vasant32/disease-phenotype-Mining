<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For the measurement, a new high-sensitivity method, double antibody radioimmunoassay method was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In healthy elderly subjects, the mean value of serum ACT was 0.229 mg/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A tendency towards increase of ACT with aging was noted but was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The serum level of ACT in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> patients was significantly higher (0.309 mg/ml) compared with the healthy elderly subjects and the VD patients (0.226 mg/ml) (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We concluded that in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e>, there was an overproduction of ACT and the serum value of ACT was markedly elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The measurement of serum ACT is very useful (sensitivity = 88.9%, specificity = 68.7%; cut-off value = 0.250 mg/ml) for the early differential diagnosis of senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
