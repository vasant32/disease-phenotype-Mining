<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four patients with probable VaD were administered the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating Scale (DRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Caregivers completed an informant-based measure of instrumental (IADL) and basic activities of daily living (BADL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up assessment was conducted one-year post-baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Logistic regression revealed that changes in the DRS Initiation/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233651" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Perseveration</z:e> and DRS Memory subscales were significantly associated with declines in IADLs and BADLs, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with VaD, longitudinal changes in IADLs and BADLs are most strongly associated with changes in executive functioning and memory abilities, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Findings suggest that different cognitive functions subserve complex instrumental and rote, habituated basic functional activities, and neuropsychological screening measures are useful in the prediction of such functional changes </plain></SENT>
