<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although overall estimates of the cost of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in Taiwan have been published, the relative cost of home care versus nursing home care for these patients is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study estimated the costs of home care and nursing home care for families of patients with either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from previous reports were used to estimate costs of home care and nursing home care for families of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, as well as the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cost of home care per patient per month was NT$85,256 for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and NT$74,152 for patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Labor was the predominant factor (96%) in home care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the cost of labor was deducted from the calculation, the family cost per patient per month was reduced to NT$4,059 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and NT$2,956 for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For patients receiving nursing home care, costs per month per patient were estimated to be NT$28,972 for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and NT$31,576 for those with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nursing home fees were the major component of costs incurred by families (at least 78% of total family costs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, payment for nursing home services amounted to approximately one-third of the labor costs of home care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that nursing home placement for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients provides a labor cost-savings for families in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
