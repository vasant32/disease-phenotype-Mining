<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Single-blind randomized controlled trial comparing CR with relaxation therapy and no treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Outpatient, community-based setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-nine individuals (41 women, 28 men; mean age 77.78 years, standard deviation 6.32, range = 56-89) with a diagnosis of AD or mixed AD and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 18 or above, and receiving a stable dose of acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-four family carers also contributed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Eight weekly individual sessions of CR consisting of personalized interventions to address individually relevant goals supported by components addressing practical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> and strategies, techniques for learning new information, practice in maintaining attention and concentration, and techniques for stress management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcomes were goal performance and satisfaction, assessed using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Questionnaires assessing mood, quality of life and career strain, and a brief neuropsychological test battery were also administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A subset of participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CR produced significant improvement in ratings of goal performance and satisfaction, whereas scores in the other two groups did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>Behavioral changes</z:hpo> in the CR group were supported by fMRI data for a subset of participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the clinical efficacy of CR in early-stage AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CR offers a means of assisting people with early-stage AD and their families in managing the effects of the condition </plain></SENT>
