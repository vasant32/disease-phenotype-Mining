<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of such protection may be related to a reduced vulnerability of women to the cerebrovascular actions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we used a model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> based on infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> (ANG II), an octapeptide that plays a key role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and produces cerebrovascular dysregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was monitored by laser-Doppler flowmetry in anesthetized (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="17967">urethane</z:chebi>-chloralose) C57BL/6J male and female mice equipped with a cranial window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ANG II administration (0.25 mug.kg(-1).min(-1) iv x 30-45 min) elevated arterial pressure equally in both sexes but attenuated the CBF increase induced by whisker stimulation or by the endothelium-dependent <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>) in male but not in female mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The administration of ANG II for 7 days (2.74 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)), using osmotic minipumps, also attenuated these cerebrovascular responses in male, but not female, mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reduced susceptibility to the effect of ANG II in female mice was abolished by ovariectomy and reinstated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> administration to ovariectomized mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> to male mice abolished the ANG II-induced attenuation of CBF responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that female mice are less susceptible to the cerebrovascular dysregulation induced by ANG II, an effect related to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such protection from the deleterious cerebrovascular effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> may play a role in the reduced vulnerability to the cerebrovascular complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> observed in women </plain></SENT>
