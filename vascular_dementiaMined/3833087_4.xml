<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thirty six male and 45 female patients (mean age 66 years) suffering from either <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer type (DAT) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of vascular type (DVT) with comparable severity and suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in old age were included in the investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was performed to evaluate the diagnostic value of Ischemic Score, EEG and CT scan of the brain in differentiating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> types and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in old age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients underwent physical, psychiatric, psychometric, neurological, neurophysiological and CT scan examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical diagnosis and diagnosis related to Ischemic Score were consistent in 86% of DAT and in 65% of DVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients suffering from DVT showed significantly higher incidence of distinct Ischemic Scale items than was found in DAT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Ischemic Scale items were found to be of major importance in differentiating vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> from both DAT and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, it was insufficient to distinguish between the latter two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In EEG, general slowing predominated in DAT (68%), and focal disturbances in DVT (71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with DAT and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> could not be differentiated on the basis of their EEG findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CT scans of the brain yielded a higher incidence of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in patients with DAT (71%) and DVT (70%) as compared to depressive patients (37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In DAT, ventricular enlargement seems to be rather disease- than age-related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Psychological testing showed abnormalities in attention and memory performance in DAT and DVT to a significantly greater extent as compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated that the combination of Ischemic Score and EEG was found to be most valid in differentiating DAT from DVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Additional cranial computerized tomography and the psychological testing of attention and memory were able to confirm the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and to differentiate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in old age </plain></SENT>
