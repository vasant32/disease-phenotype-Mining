<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to examine whether the changes in these parameters would be able to discriminate the patients with AD from those with VaD and from healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed the levels of Aβ42, IL-6 and TNF-α in the serum of newly diagnosed 28 AD patients, 16 VaD patients and 26 healthy non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also investigated whether there is an association between Aβ42, IL-6 and TNF-α levels and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores and body mass indexes (BMI) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data showed a significant decrease in serum Aβ-42 levels in AD patients compared to VaD patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Levels of IL-6 and TNF-α were not different between AD patients, VaD patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed a correlation between Aβ-42 levels and MMSE scores and BMI levels in both AD and VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, Aβ-42 levels were not correlated with IL-6 and TNF-α levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significantly lower levels of Aβ42 found in the serum of AD patients than that of VaD patients and controls suggests that it can be a specific biochemical marker for AD </plain></SENT>
