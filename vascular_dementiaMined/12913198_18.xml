<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen patients with SIVD (71 +/- 8 years old) and 43 patients with AD of comparable age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity were studied using MRSI and MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were compared to 52 cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects with and without lacunes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to controls, patients with SIVD had lower <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> by 18% (p &lt; 0.001) in frontal cortex and by 27% (p &lt; 0.003) in parietal cortex, but no significant <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> reduction in white matter and medial temporal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared to patients with AD, patients with SIVD had lower <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> by 13% (p &lt; 0.02) in frontal cortex and by 20% (p &lt; 0.002) in left parietal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cortical <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> decreased in SIVD with increasing white matter lesions (r = 0.54, p &lt; 0.02) and number of lacunes (r = 0.59, p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thalamic lacunes were associated with greater <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> reduction in frontal cortex than were lacunes outside the thalamus (p &lt; 0.02) across groups, after adjusting for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adding parietal <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> to MRI-derived hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> improved separation between SIVD and AD (p = 0.02) from 79 to 89% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results emphasize the importance of cortical dysfunction as a factor in SIVD and indicate a characteristic pattern of metabolite change that might serve as a basis for improved diagnosis </plain></SENT>
