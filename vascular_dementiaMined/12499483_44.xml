<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine whether high intake of total fat, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26607">saturated fatty acids</z:chebi> (saturated fat), trans fatty acids (trans fat), and cholesterol and low intake of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25413">monounsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi> (MUFA), <z:chebi fb="7" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi> (PUFA), n-6 PUFA, and n-3 PUFA are associated with increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and its subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Data from the Rotterdam Study, a prospective cohort study among elderly, were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At baseline (1990 to 1993), 5,395 subjects had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognition, were noninstitutionalized, and underwent complete dietary assessment by a semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cohort was continuously monitored for incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and re-examinations were performed in 1993 to 1994 and 1997 to 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association between fat intake and incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was examined by Cox's proportional hazards models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 6.0 years, 197 subjects developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (146 AD, 29 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High intake of total, saturated, trans fat, and cholesterol and low intake of MUFA, PUFA, n-6 PUFA, and n-3 PUFA were not associated with increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or its subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rate ratios of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> per standard deviation increase in intake were for total fat 0.93 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.07), for saturated fat 0.91 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.05), for trans fat 0.90 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.06), for cholesterol 0.93 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.08), for MUFA 0.96 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.10), for PUFA 1.05 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.38), for n-6 PUFA 1.03 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.36), and for n-3 PUFA 1.07 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High intake of total, saturated, and trans fat and cholesterol and low intake of MUFA, PUFA, n-6 PUFA, and n-3 PUFA were not associated with increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or its subtypes </plain></SENT>
