<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was carried out in a group of 69 patients divided into two groups: group i of 32 patients aged 45-78 years, mean age 58.4 years with two or more ischaemic foci on TDU and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cases in this group fulfilled the criteria of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> according to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> 10, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> scale and Hachinski ischaemic scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In TDU the following parameters were analysed: maximal velocity /Vmax/, minimal velocity /Vd/, mean velocity /Vmean/ of blood flow in the middle cerebral arteries, pulsation index /PI/ and resistance index /RI/ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In group II the patients were divided into three subgroups according to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10 criteria and localization of ischaemic foci: with cortical, subcortical and mixed lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The following conclusion have been drawn: 1/ the parameters of TDU could serve for differentiation of patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; 2/ the PI and RI parameters in TDU are most valuable for diagnosis establishing; 3/ the transcranial Doppler ultrasonography is insufficient for differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
