<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The anterior-medial thalamus (AMT), which is associated with memory processing, is severely affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> pathology and, when damaged, can be the sole cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) hyperintensities affecting the AMT, and their relationship with sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 205 consecutive participants from a university cognitive neurology clinic underwent clinical evaluation, neuropsychological testing and quantitative MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AMT hyperintensities &gt;5 mm3 occurred in 0 of 34 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls but were found in 5 of 30 (17%) participants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (CIND), 9 of 109 (8%) patients with probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 7 of 17 (41%) with mixed disease and 8 of 15 (53%) with probable vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AMT hyperintensities occurred more often in participants with stepwise decline than in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slow progression</z:hpo> (chi2 = 31.7; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 29 people with AMT hyperintensities, those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slow progression</z:hpo> had smaller medial temporal width (p&lt;0.001) and smaller anterior-medial thalamic hyperintensities (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a logistic regression model, both variables were significant, and the pattern of decline was correctly classified in 86% of the sample (Cox and Snell R2 = 0.56; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those with AMT hyperintensities &gt;55 mm3 were likely to have stepwise decline in cognitive function regardless of medial temporal lobe width; in contrast, those with smaller AMT hyperintensities showed a stepwise decline only in the absence of medial temporal lobe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with VaD had left-sided AMT hyperintensities, whereas those with CIND had right-sided AMT hyperintensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AMT hyperintensities &gt;55 mm3 probably result in symptomatic decline, whereas smaller lesions may go unrecognised by clinicians and radiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only half of those with AMT hyperintensities had diagnoses of VaD or mixed disease; the other AMT hyperintensities occurred in patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> or CIND </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These silent hyperintensities may nevertheless contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>AMT hyperintensities may represent a major and under-recognised contributor to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
