<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have suggested that vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in older persons is more common than previously hypothesized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A substantial proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in old age may be an early manifestation of cerebrovascular disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>), that eventually becomes clinically evident as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed at assessing whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in older persons free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are associated with higher risk of future <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, independently of other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Population-based prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5024 subjects from the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly, who were alive and had no history of previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at the sixth follow-up visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects who had reported a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in a previous interview or with a diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease in a hospitalization record during the previous 3 years were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Cognitive function was assessed by the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Occurrence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was prospectively assessed by examining hospital discharge diagnoses and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 19,533 person-years of follow-up, 259 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were recorded (13.3/1000 person-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> incidence was lowest in those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> SPMSQ score (12.1/1000 person-years), intermediate in those with moderate impairment (16.3/1000 person-years), and highest in those with severe impairment (30.9/1000 person-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adjusting for age, education, smoking, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, blood pressure, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027051" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MR|mi|AMI">heart attack</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and disability, the relative risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> for moderate and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> were 1.2 (0.9-1.6) and 2.2 (1.2-3.8), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was not mediated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Compared with subjects with stable or improved SPMSQ score in the previous 3 years, those who declined had higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The elevated risk of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in older persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> suggests that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> may play larger role in causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> then previously suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It remains to be demonstrated whether reducing modifiable risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> decreases the burden of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in older persons without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
