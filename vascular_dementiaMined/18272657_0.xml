<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A group of patients diagnosed with probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> or mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>), was assessed using the Kingston Standardized Behavioral Assessment, ranked by total Kingston Standardized Behavioral Assessment score and were divided into quartile-based groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The scores revealed changes in behavior patterns across quartiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant behavior change appeared even in quartile one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lower scores were predominantly associated with neuropsychological behaviors; as scores increased, neuropsychiatric behaviors became equally common </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>Behavioral changes</z:hpo> appear both early and throughout <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; the type and pattern of these emerging behaviors change as the disease progresses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinicians can use the typical patterns of behavioral change to identify behavioral impairment in individual patients and anticipate future changes and related care needs </plain></SENT>
