<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 526 consecutive patients, who had suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> 3 months ago were recruited in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified as having no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (NCI), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> but no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (CIND) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) according to their cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were also categorized as with subcortical ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> (SIVD) or cortical ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> (CIVD) with neuroimaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their demographic data, vascular risk factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> characteristics were also documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall prevalence of PSCI (CIND + VaD) was 36.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with the NCI subjects, PSCI subjects were older, more dominant femininely, less educated, with more cases of right hemi-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> and higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scores, but did not have more specific vascular risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Separately, VaD patients demonstrated lower economic level, less spouse-caring, more prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002357'>dysphasia</z:hpo>, higher rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">incontinence</z:e> and more cases with CIVD, while CIND patients had more cases with SIVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The VaD patients had more cortical lesions and lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scores than the CIND patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On logistic regression analysis, older age, female gender, lower economic level, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002357'>dysphasia</z:hpo>, SIVD, CIVD and higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scores were independent risk factors for PSCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PSCI is common among <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients and related to demographic factors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> types, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
