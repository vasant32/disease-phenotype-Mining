<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There has been little investigation on the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and the microbleeds (MBs) frequently seen in subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (SVaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One possible mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in individuals with SVaD could be disruption of cholinergic fibers by vascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Central cholinergic circuits in human brain can be tested non-invasively by means of a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocol named short latency afferent inhibition (SAI) of motor cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we used this test in SvaD patients with and without MBs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SAI was evaluated in 13 SVaD patients with MBs (MB-positive group) and the data were compared with those from a group of 15 SVaD patients without MBs (MB-negative group) and with those from 20 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we studied covariation of individual SAI values with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) total score and subscores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SAI was significantly reduced in the MB-positive group when compared with the MB-negative group and the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total MMSE score, "attention and calculation" and "orientation" subscores were significantly lower in the MB-positive group than in the MB-negative group; SAI showed a positive correlation with total MMSE score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for age, gender, education, presence of lacunae, severe white matter hyperintensities or severe periventricular hyperintensities did not affect these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study provides novel physiological evidence that MBs have an impact on central cholinergic function that is independent of the extent of associated white matter changes and ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This finding shows that TMS have potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TMS studies may help in evaluating the causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
