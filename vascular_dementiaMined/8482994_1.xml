<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients with a Hachinski's ischaemic score of 7 or above and marked ischaemic lesions on CT were assigned to the vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients with probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> according to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, 2 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e>, 1 patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002503'>spinocerebellar degeneration</z:hpo>, and 1 patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236642" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pick's disease</z:e> were assigned to the non-vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (nonVD) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sum of blood flow volume in the bilateral common carotid arteries (CCA flow) in the nonVD group and in the VD group was lower than that in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CCA flow in the VD group was lower than that in the nonVD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison of patients matched for both age and the Hasegawa's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rating scale also revealed lower CCA flow in the VD group than in the nonVD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Linear discriminant function analysis showed that nearly 90% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients were correctly diagnosed as having VD or as having nonVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results show the usefulness of colour duplex sonography in the differential diagnosis of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
