<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The relationship between the behavioural and psychological symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (BPSD) and negative outcomes in carers has been consistently demonstrated, however the quality of the assessment of the former in routine clinical settings is variable and validated interview-based scales are frequently underutilised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To develop a carer self-report questionnaire, the Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms Questionnaire (BPSQ), for the assessment of the neuropsychiatric symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and associated carer distress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The BPSQ was administered to the carers of 30 community-dwelling older adults with diagnoses of Alzheimer's or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and the results compared with interview assessment using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BPSD were present in 96.2% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was strong correlation (r(s) = 0.61, p &lt; 0.001) between the BPSQ and interview with respect to measures of symptom frequency and severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there was significant divergence between the two assessment schedules with respect to carer distress which was found to be significantly under-reported in the initial interview (U = 64.00, z = -5.22, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The BPSQ is an effective tool to complement clinical interview in the assessment and monitoring of BPSD, and provides useful additional information with respect to carer distress, which currently may be under recognised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A follow-up study is required to complete the work of validating the BPSQ </plain></SENT>
