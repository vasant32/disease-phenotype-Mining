<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: This study aimed to examine the validity and item-response characteristics of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), which is used for assessing cognitive function, in Japanese older adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Factor analysis and item response analysis were carried out for MMSE responses (n = 1971) from older adults living in the community (n = 1339) or in a nursing home (n = 632), including Alzheimer-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n = 330), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n = 36), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (n = 7), mixed Alzheimer-type and frontotemporal type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n = 27), and age-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> (n = 29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When choosing the cut-off score of 23 points for the MMSE, sensitivity and specificity for each item were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A three-factor solution was found to be most appropriate by factor analysis: complex processing, simple processing and working memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The item characteristics curves showed unidimensionality with high reproducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified a simplified scale comprising 10 items in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants: "naming", "three-step command", "registration", "repeat a sentence", "write a complete sentence", "copies drawing of two polygons", "orientation to place", "delayed recall", "orientation to time" and "serial sevens" tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity for both "year" task and "day" task were more than 90% ("year": sensitivity 92.5%, specificity 96.3%; "day": sensitivity 92.4%, specificity 91.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the Alzheimer-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients, the five-factor solution was suggested by factor analysis and the MMSE also had unidimensionality in terms of level of difficulty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found that the MMSE had multiple cognitive areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We showed that the MMSE could be used as an essentially unidimensional measure of cognitive ability and the question about orientation to time might be useful in the simplest assessment to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
