<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Probucol is a <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering agent with potent anti-oxidant properties once commonly used for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Probucol therapy was found to stabilize cognitive symptoms in elderly AD patients, whereas in amyloid transgenic mice probucol was shown to attenuate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of probucol have note been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study we investigated whether probucol can prevent <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disturbances induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ingestion of proinflammatory diets enriched with either 20% (w/w) saturated fats (SFA) or 1% (w/w) cholesterol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mice were fed the diets for 12 weeks before they were killed and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> integrity was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mice maintained on either the SFA- or cholesterol-supplemented diets were found to have a 30- and sevenfold greater likelihood of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> dysfunction, respectively, as determined by the parenchymal extravasation of plasma-derived immunoglobulins and endogenous <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> enrichment with β-amyloid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, mice fed the SFA- or cholesterol-enriched diets that also contained 1% (w/w) probucol showed no evidence of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The parenchymal expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein, a marker of cerebrovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, was significantly greater in mice fed the SFA-enriched diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>, β-amyloid and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B levels were not increased by feeding of the SFA- or cholesterol-enriched diets </plain></SENT>
