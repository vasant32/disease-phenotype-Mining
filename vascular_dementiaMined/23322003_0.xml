<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we investigated the validity of VFT in the differential diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD, n = 65), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD, n = 65), mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI, n = 92), and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VCIND, n = 76) relative to cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> senior controls (NC, n = 374) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that in the NC group, the total correct score was significantly correlated with age and education; males generated more subcategories; cluster size increased with education, and subcategory and switching decreased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significantly progressive advantage was observed in VFT scores in the sequence NC &gt; MCI/VCIND &gt; AD/VaD, and this significantly discriminated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients from the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AD patients performed better in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four VFT scores than VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subcategory and switching scores significantly distinguished AD from VaD patients (AD &gt; VaD; mean difference, 0.50 for subcategory, P &lt;0.05; 0.71 for switching, P &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MCI patients scored higher than VCIND patients, but the difference did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that semantic VFT is useful for the detection of MCI and VCIND, and in the differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
