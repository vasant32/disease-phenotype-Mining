<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated atrophic alterations in different regions of the corpus callosum in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) with respect to clinical changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>32 patients with AD (NINCDS-ADRDA criteria), 17 patients with VD (NINDS-AIREN criteria) and 13 healthy control subjects were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>3-D MRI sequences were acquired using a 1.5T MRI scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The size of the corpus callosum and its subdivisions was sampled on 5 mid-saggital slices using a personal computer-based software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total callosal size was significantly reduced in AD but not in VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the most rostral parts of the corpus callosum were significantly smaller in AD when compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Again, these changes were not found in patients with VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was significantly correlated with the size of the midbody of the corpus callosum in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Callosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in AD may reflect the severity and pattern of cortical neuronal damage occurring mostly in the inferior frontal, anterior parietal and midtemporal regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Correlations between regional callosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> indicate that interhemispheric cortico-cortical disconnections may contribute to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
