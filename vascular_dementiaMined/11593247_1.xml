<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 178 patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were seen at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009241" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disorder</z:e> clinic from 1996 to 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum B-12 levels were studied in 100 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>15 patients (39.5%) of Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> had reduced B-12 levels, while only 5 patients (13.9%) with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> and 3 patients (11.5%) with other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> had reduced levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of low serum B-12 was statistically significant in the Alzheimer's group when compared with the other groups, individually as well as combined together (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aetiopathogenesis and significance of these findings is discussed and the literature is reviewed </plain></SENT>
