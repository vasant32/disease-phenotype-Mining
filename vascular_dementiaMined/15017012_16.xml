<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CADASIL causes repeated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> leading to subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess whether cerebral blood flow (CBF) and regional cerebral metabolic rates of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (rCMR(gluc)) in CADASIL patients are affected in early adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CBF and rCMR(gluc) were examined with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography in correlation with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 14 adult (19 to 41 years) CADASIL patients with the Notch3 R133C mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> and 3 had experienced &gt; or =1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean CBF in the CADASIL patients was significantly lower in both frontal (P=0.019) and occipital (P=0.009) white matter (WM) than those in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CBF decreased significantly with increased severity of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients had lower mean rCMR(gluc) values than the controls, although differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sum scores of semiquantitative MRI rating scale (Scheltens) correlated significantly with WM CBF but not with rCMR(gluc) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In CADASIL, there is an early and significant decrease in the CBF of WM associated with simultaneous MRI changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These are obviously caused by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> in long penetrating arteries and indicate early tissue damage, also expressed as impaired rCMR(gluc) in the WM </plain></SENT>
