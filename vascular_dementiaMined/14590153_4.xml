<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the different mechanisms that may underlie deficits in verbal concept formation among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and ischaemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (IVD) associated with periventricular and deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter alterations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Concept formation was assessed with the WAIS-R Similarities subtest (SIM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two types of errors were re-coded from the 0-point responses as scored by the WAIS-R manual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In set errors (e.g., dog-lion "they're alive") were coded when patients reported a very vague superordinate concept for the word pair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Out of set responses (e.g., dog-lion "the lion roars and the dog barks") were coded when a response was clearly out of mental set, i.e., when participants were unable to provide a superordinate concept for the word pair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Between-group comparisons demonstrated no difference in SIM test performance according to the scoring system described in the WAIS-R manual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, AD patients produced a greater proportion of in set errors, while IVD patients produced a greater proportion of out of set errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Out of set errors were highly associated with measures of executive function, while in set errors were associated with measures related to delayed recognition memory and semantic intrusion errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the underlying deficits that contribute to poor concept formation differ between AD and IVD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In IVD impaired concept formation is related to deficits in the executive systems necessary to monitor responses and sustain mental set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In AD, by contrast, the deficit appears to be secondary to impaired verbal response selection </plain></SENT>
