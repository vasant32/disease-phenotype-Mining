<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the association of ApoE polymorphism with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) is yet to be established in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a case-control study involving 54 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (29 AD and 25 VaD) and 76 age-matched healthy controls, the frequency of epsilon4 allele was significantly higher among cases of AD and VaD compared with controls (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The epsilon3epsilon3 (p &lt; 0.05) and epsilon2epsilon3 (p &lt; 0.001) genotypes were found to be protective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The odds of developing AD or VaD were 4.4 and 3.7 times higher, respectively, in the presence of even a single epsilon4 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the increased risk of developing AD or VaD is similar among Asian Indians with ApoE epsilon4 compared with the Caucasian population </plain></SENT>
