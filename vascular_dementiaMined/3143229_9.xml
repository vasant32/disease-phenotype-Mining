<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The vascular supply to the central zone of the genu and body of the corpus callosum, via short penetrating arterioles, is similar to that of the cerebral cortex, whereas the vascular supply to the extreme lateral corpus callosum, centrum semiovale, and basal ganglia is substantially carried by long end-arteries </plain></SENT>
