<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous work suggests that temporal lobe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can distinguish those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer type (DAT) from healthy age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its specificity with regard to conditions such as vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and other disorders associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> has not been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 222 subjects using T1 weighted MRI with 5.1 mm coronal slices throughout the temporal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects included: healthy controls (N = 40); <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (N = 61); NINCDS/ADRDA DAT (N = 77) and OTHER (N = 44, comprising subjects with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington's disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo>, alcohol related <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and a group of 'memory complainers') </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hippocampus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus and cerebral cortex were rated visually on a 0-3 scale by two experienced neuroradiologists blind to clinical diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ratings of temporal lobe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> provided good separation between those with AD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For example, anterior hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> had a sensitivity of 83% for detecting DAT, a specificity of 80% for controls, 87% for depressed subjects and 89% for OTHER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other regions were less sensitive, but more specific for the diagnosis of DAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In particular parahippocampal gyrus and entorhinal cortex had high specificity (97% for depressed subjects and 98% for OTHER) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because of an age-related increase in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, sensitivity was highest for those over the age of 75, while specificity was highest for younger subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations were observed between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> ratings of hippocampus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus and CAMCOG memory score and length of history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Temporal lobe MRI may have an important role in assisting with the clinical diagnosis of DAT, particularly its differentiation from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and other disorders that may cause diagnostic difficulties in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
