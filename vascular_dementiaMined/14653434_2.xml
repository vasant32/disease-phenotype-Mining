<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors previously reported that subcortical hyperintensity (SH) and whole-brain volume (WBV) each covary with different subscale scores of the Mattis <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating Scale (MDRS) among vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present longitudinal analysis examined these relationships for change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors found that SH volume increased and WBV decreased significantly over 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At baseline, SH volume accounted for significant variance in MDRS total score and every subscale score, except Memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>WBV was unrelated to any MDRS measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 12 months, SH volume was related only to the Construction subscale score, whereas WBV accounted for the majority of variance in Attention and Memory subscale performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that although SH volume increases with disease progression, the relative impact of SH volume on cognitive status decreases among patients with advanced VaD </plain></SENT>
