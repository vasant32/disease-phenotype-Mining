<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are speculations that SSAO activity might be related to the development of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate whether changes of soluble SSAO activity, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> markers are related to each other in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Soluble and tissue-bound SSAO activities (from serum and aorta, respectively) were determined in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ)-induced diabetic rats without insulin treatment, receiving insulin once, or twice daily compared to control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After three weeks of treatment soluble and tissue-bound SSAO activities (seSSAO and aoSSAO, respectively), serum total <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> status (TAS), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> levels and routine laboratory parameters were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SeSSAO activity significantly increased in the diabetic groups without treatment and receiving insulin once daily, and a marked decrease in aoSSAO activity was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diabetic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> was correlated with hsCRP elevation, while hsCRP and seSSAO activity were also significantly correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups seSSAO and aoSSAO activities were in negative correlation with each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results support the view that poor metabolic control leads to increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, which in turn may cause the elevation of hsCRP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Soluble SSAO on the one hand acts as an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule--thus possibly being a factor responsible for the late complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>--and on the other hand, it may contribute to <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our parsimonious conclusion is that there is a relation between the risk factors of AD and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>) and SSAO activity, which may originate from the vessel wall </plain></SENT>
