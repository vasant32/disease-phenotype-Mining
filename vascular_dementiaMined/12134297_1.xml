<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These are not easily detected using conventional diagnostic tools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some of the most frequent disorders after a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> are those affecting sustained attention or vigilance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The event related potential (ERP) P300 or P3 could be a valuable diagnostic indicator of this type of disorder and its evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AIMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The evaluation and diagnosis of sub clinical disorders of sustained attention in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> by using ERP as a method of diagnosis and follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 13 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> located in the left parietal lobe, 13 with infarction in the right parietal lobe and 26 healthy control subjects, who were paired by gender, age and educational level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were submitted to a computerized continuous performance test, associated with the recording of electrical brain activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with right parietal lesions made more mistakes due to omission, answered fewer questions correctly and had a lower attention index than the rest of the patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although there were no significant differences in the P3 amplitude values, patients with right lesion presented significantly increased latencies in the F7, Fz and Cz derivations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After five months there was a significant improvement in performance in the attentional test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The value of the latency in the Cz derivation, nine days after the occurrence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, was related with the number of mistakes made by the subjects five months later in the attention test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with an ischemic lesion in the right parietal lobe presented disorders in sustained attention, which were only diagnosed adequately by use of computerized tests associated with ERP recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This shows that evoked potentials are valuable in cognitive diagnosis, and also demonstrates the relation that exists between the capacity to hold the attention on a stimulus over a period of time and the structures of the right parietal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Five months later, these disorders of a sub clinical nature can disappear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The value of the latency in Cz, nine days after the occurrence of the event, acts as a predictor of this recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Cognitive rehabilitation plans could benefit from the use of these diagnostic tools </plain></SENT>
