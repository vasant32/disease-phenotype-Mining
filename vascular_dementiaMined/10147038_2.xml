<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Over the past 30 years the identification of <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercholesterolaemia</z:e> as major predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> has led to an increasing expenditure on healthcare costs in pharmacological treatment of these risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of the cost has been due to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment, but evidence from randomised trials of the benefits of cholesterol-lowering drugs, along with the introduction of therapies with fewer side effects, suggests that expenditure on cholesterol treatment will rise dramatically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cost-effectiveness analyses can aid decision making in the use of these treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercholesterolaemia</z:e>, the most favourable cost-effectiveness ratios were found in late middle age, in men compared to women, at the highest level of the risk factor, and in subjects with multiple risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most cost-effective treatments appear to be those which were the cheapest and which also produced the largest reductions in the risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, certain findings were based on assumptions which may be invalid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most important of these in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and to a lesser extent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercholesterolaemia</z:e>, is that different treatments have similar effects on morbidity and mortality for a given level of risk reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Experimental evidence that might confirm or refute this is not available for most treatments of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover there are no trials in women or in the elderly of cholesterol-lowering treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The burden of disease due to these risk factors has been underestimated, and further research is required to establish the benefits of treatment on prevention of conditions such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo>, and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
