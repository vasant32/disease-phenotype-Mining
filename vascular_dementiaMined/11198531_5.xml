<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To measure changes in brain and ischemic volume over time by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as part of a randomized treatment trial of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants who met criteria for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> underwent comprehensive neurological and neuropsychological testing on entrance, during, and at completion of the 1-year study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For those centers who had easily available MRI, MRI of the brain was to be performed on entry and completion of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Image analysis was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> balanced and T2-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> films to determine ventricular, sulcal, ischemic, and hemispheric brain volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 105 patients who met the criteria for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 40 had a baseline MRI study that met protocol requirements and was of excellent image quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The baseline ventricular volume in these 40 patients with high-quality <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> correlated with most measures of cognitive and behavioral function, including the total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Assessment Score (ADAS) (r = 0.51, P = .0024), as well as activities of daily living (r = 0.61, P = .0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The baseline ischemic brain volume correlated well only with the gait and postural stability scale (r = 0.74, P = .009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 40 participants, 25 had MRI studies at baseline and at completion of the study that were comparable and of excellent image quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For these 25 patients, the mean ventricular volumes increased by 9% over the study year (P = .001) and the mean ischemic brain volume increased by 18% (P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Temporal changes in the sulcal and nonischemic brain volume did not reach significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the 14 clinical score measures changed significantly between baseline and completion of the study in these 25 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In summary, ventricular volume correlated well with cognitive measures in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and was a more sensitive marker for change during the study year than the clinical scales used in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study also points out the practical limitations of brain imaging as a surrogate measure of clinical outcome in multicenter randomized treatment trials of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
