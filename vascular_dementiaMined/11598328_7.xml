<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the association between blood pressure (BP) disturbances and leuko-araiosis, we retrospectively reviewed CT scans and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitorings of 79 elderly patients (57 women and 22 men; mean age: 83.3 +/- 6.4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 79 patients, 50 were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> (30 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and 18 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) and 29 were not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The leuko-araiosis score (LA score) was determined by using Rezek's scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To evaluate short-term variation of BP, we determined (1) the variability of systolic and diastolic BPs (SBP, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>; within-subject standard deviation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> readings over a 24-hour period), (2) the coefficient of variability (variability of BP/mean BP) and (3) the maximal variation of BP (difference between the maximum and minimum 24-hour BPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Higher LA scores were associated with higher SBPs in 24-hour, diurnal and nocturnal periods, higher maximal variation of SBP, greater variability of SBP during 24-hour, diurnal and nocturnal periods and greater coefficient of variability of SBP during sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that elevations and short-term variations of SBP may contribute to the pathogenesis of white matter lesions in elderly persons </plain></SENT>
