<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and to measure the monetary impact and health resources utilization of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) compared to Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD) in persons aged over 64 years in a population setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective, cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the initial phase, information was obtained on specific clinical characteristics from the subjects with an active diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second phase consisted of a clinical evaluation and validation of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mini-Mental State Examination was used to assess <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> and its subtypes were determined using established diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Information was obtained on the use of health care resources (direct costs) and the number of hours devoted by the primary caregiver (indirect costs) for patients with a documented diagnosis of AD or VD within the last 6 months prior to the interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to correct the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 6,004 subjects were analyzed, 258 with diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (overall prevalence: 4.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An evaluation was made of 224 patients, and gross prevalence of AD and VD was 2.4 and 1.0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cost per patient per semester was EUR 8,086 for AD and EUR 11,039 for VD (p = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>85.5% of the cost was attributable to primary caregiver time in AD and 84.4% in VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of AD and VD increases with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No sociodemographic differences were seen between AD and VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Costs associated with health care resource and primary caregiver utilization were high, being higher in VD than in AD </plain></SENT>
