<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (tHcy) and ROS levels, and total <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> capacity (<z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi>) were determined in 71 AD, 36 MCI and 28 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) patients as well as in 44 age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>tHcy levels were significantly increased in patients with AD and VaD an a trend towards an increase in multiple domain MCI was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi> was significantly decreased in AD as well as MCI, but not in VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In AD patients, a negative correlation was found between <z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi> and disease duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ROS levels did not differ among groups, but were correlated with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a pattern characterized by increased tHcy levels and decreased <z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi> is present in AD as well as MCI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While increased tHcy levels were also found in VaD, <z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi> modifications occur specifically in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ROS levels appear to be correlated with age rather than with a specific dementing disorder, thus leading to the hypothesis that oxidative imbalance observed in AD could be due to a decreased <z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
