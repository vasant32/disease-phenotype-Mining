<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at early or even preclinical stages has important implications for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A community dwelling sample of 647 subjects aged 75 and over at recruitment were followed up for a mean period of 3.19 years (range 2.61 to 4.51 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each subject was asked to participate in a medical assessment which included a standardised medical history examining both past and current health and medication usage; a neuropsychological battery (mini mental state examination, Reid memory test, verbal fluency, subsets of the Boston naming test and similarities, clock drawing and copied drawings) and physical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preclinical syndromes for the three predominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e>, and related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>) and their combinations were defined using cognitive, motor, and vascular features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their longitudinal outcome as defined by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> incidence was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Preclinical syndromes affected 55.7% (n=299) of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preclinical syndromes showed a trend for an increased odds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (odds ratio 1.72, p=0.056) and a significantly increased odds of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (odds ratio 4.81, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preclinical syndromes were highly sensitive, detecting 52 of 58 (89.7%) incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and sixteen of 268 (80.6%) preclinical subjects did not show <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> over the 3 year period (positive predictive value 19.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subjects defined as having a combination of cognitive, extrapyramidal, and vascular features were at greatest risk of progressing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preclinical syndromes were sensitive and significant predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In view of their poor positive predictive value, the preclinical syndromes as defined in this study remain a research tool needing both definitional refinement and greater periods of observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Multiple coexistent preclinical disorders resulted in a greater incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, providing evidence for an additive role between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679225" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">multiple disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
