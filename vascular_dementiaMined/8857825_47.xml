<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between May 1, 1992 and May 1, 1994, the prevalence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were examined in the Japanese American population aged over 65 years in King County, Washington State </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 3,045 eligible individuals were identified in a census of persons who were of at least 50% Japanese heritage </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prevalence rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> increased continuously with age and were 30%, 50%, and 74% for participants aged 85-89, 90-94, and &gt; or = 95 years, respectively; for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, prevalence rates were 14%, 36%, and 58% for these three age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> were generally higher among women; for multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, rates for men and women were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the institutional population, the prevalence rate was 66%, and in the community, 2.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Persons with lower education had higher overall rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> than those with higher education, but this tendency became weak and inconsistent when rates were age-stratified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in this geographically defined population of Japanese Americans was somewhat higher than prevalence rates reported from Japan, and the distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtypes more closely resembled that found in Caucasian populations in North America and Europe than previously reported in Asian populations </plain></SENT>
