<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the relation between subcortical hyperintensities (SHs) visible on magnetic resonance imaging and executive function among patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The relation between SHs and executive dysfunction is not well understood, because studies have varied widely in methodology and have produced conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We examined the relation between SHs (expressed as a percentage of total brain volume, not including ventricular volume) and six tests of executive function in a well-defined group of 24 individuals with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Executive tests were divided in two groups: Attention/Speed and Abstraction/Problem Solving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bivariate correlations were computed between individual neuropsychological variables and SHs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results showed significant bivariate correlations between SHs and three of the four tests in the Attention/Speed domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subcortical hyperintensities shared virtually no association with performance on tests in the Abstraction/Problem-Solving domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The finding that SHs are significantly associated with psychomotor slowing and attentional dysfunction is consistent with what is known about the behavioral manifestations of subcortical disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More detailed investigations of the regional distribution of SHs as well as measures of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, hypoperfusion, and hypometabolism may be necessary to accurately characterize the complex relation between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> and different aspects of executive dysfunction </plain></SENT>
