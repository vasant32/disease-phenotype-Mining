<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies demonstrated that SH burden accounts for a degree of the cognitive burden among VaD patients, although it remains unclear if individual factors such as cognitive reserve influence cognitive status in VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this issue, we examined 36 individuals diagnosed with probable VaD (age = 77.56; education = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> individuals underwent MMSE evaluations and MRI brain scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We predicted that individuals with higher educational attainment would exhibit less cognitive difficulty despite similar levels of SH volume, compared to individuals with less educational attainment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A regression analysis revealed that greater SH volume was associated with lower scores on the MMSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, education moderated the relationship between SH volume and MMSE score, demonstrating that individuals with higher education had higher scores on the MMSE despite similar degrees of SH burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that educational attainment buffers the deleterious effects of SH burden on cognitive status among VaD patients </plain></SENT>
