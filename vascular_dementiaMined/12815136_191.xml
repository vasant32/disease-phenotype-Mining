<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Participation in leisure activities has been associated with a lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unclear whether increased participation in leisure activities lowers the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or participation in leisure activities declines during the preclinical phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the relation between leisure activities and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in a prospective cohort of 469 subjects older than 75 years of age who resided in the community and did not have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at base line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the frequency of participation in leisure activities at enrollment and derived cognitive-activity and physical-activity scales in which the units of measure were activity-days per week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional-hazards analysis was used to evaluate the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> according to the base-line level of participation in leisure activities, with adjustment for age, sex, educational level, presence or absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> medical illnesses, and base-line cognitive status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over a median follow-up period of 5.1 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> developed in 124 subjects (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> in 61 subjects, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in 30, mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in 25, and other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among leisure activities, reading, playing board games, playing musical instruments, and dancing were associated with a reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A one-point increment in the cognitive-activity score was significantly associated with a reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (hazard ratio, 0.93 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.90 to 0.97]), but a one-point increment in the physical-activity score was not (hazard ratio, 1.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association with the cognitive-activity score persisted after the exclusion of the subjects with possible preclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at base line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results were similar for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In linear mixed models, increased participation in cognitive activities at base line was associated with reduced rates of decline in memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Participation in leisure activities is associated with a reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, even after adjustment for base-line cognitive status and after the exclusion of subjects with possible preclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Controlled trials are needed to assess the protective effect of cognitive leisure activities on the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
