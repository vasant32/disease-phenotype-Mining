<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate age- and sex-specific incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD), and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) in the Conselice Study of Brain Aging, an Italian prospective population-based study, and to assess whether poor education is a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 1999 to 2000, the baseline study identified a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-free cohort of 937 subjects aged 65 years and older who were reexamined in 2003 to 2004 using a two-phase procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Information was obtained for 91% of the subjects at risk; 115 incident cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates per 1,000 person-years were 37.8 (95% CI = 30.0 to 47.7) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 23.8 (95% CI = 17.3 to 31.7) for AD, and 11.0 (95% CI = 7.2 to 16.9) for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This translates into more than 400,000 new cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> expected per year in Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increasing age was an independent risk factor for both AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Poor education was an independent risk factor for AD but not VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sex did not affect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this Italian population-based cohort, incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> increased with age, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) was the most frequent type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Poor education was associated with a higher risk of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our incidence rates are higher than previously reported in Italy, and provide new estimates for projection of future burden of disease in Italy </plain></SENT>
