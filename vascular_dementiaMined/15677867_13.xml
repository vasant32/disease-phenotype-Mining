<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test which of the core (dysexecutive syndrome with relative sparing of memory, gait disorders and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002071'>extrapyramidal signs</z:hpo>) and supporting (urinary and behavioral symptoms) clinical features are most useful to recognize patients with svMCI and discriminate them from those with amnestic MCI (aMCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-nine svMCI and 14 aMCI patients were seen in a memory clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tests and scales assessing core and supporting features that independently contributed to the discrimination between svMCI and aMCI were identified with stepwise logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of the discrimination was estimated with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most accurate scales were the extrapyramidal sign scale by Richards et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(0.75, 95% CI 0.61-0.89), letter fluency (0.75, 95% CI 0.61-0.90), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo> of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and urinary dependence (0.66, 95% CI 0.49-0.82 for both), and digit span forward (0.59, 95% CI 0.41-0.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall accuracy of a model compounding information from main and supporting features was 0.98, 95% CI 0.94-1.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the domains that are included in the clinical criteria for svMCI independently contribute to the identification of the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These criteria can be useful to recognize svMCI patients in clinical settings </plain></SENT>
