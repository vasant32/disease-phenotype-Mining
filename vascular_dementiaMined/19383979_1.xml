<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods: Patients (n = 34, mean age = 71.8 + 7.12) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger</z:e> type subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> from 8 multicenter, according to clinical and neuroradiological working criteria, were selected to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> 5 mg/day (n = 2) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> 10 mg/day (n = 32, after 5 mg/day) for 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our primary endpoints were change from baseline to weeks 12 and 24 in the Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> version (SNSB-D) and the Korean version of neuropsychiatric inventory (K-NPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 24 patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> completed the study (mean age = 72.0 + 7.5 K-Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] = 21.0 + 5.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 12 weeks and 24 weeks, patients showed improvements in cognitive function on the SNSB-D compared baseline of 16.29 points at 12 weeks (P &lt; .05) and 12.44 points at 24 weeks (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant improvements were shown in only memory domain, immediate verbal recall and delayed recall tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subgroup with better cognitive function (SNSB-D &gt; 100) were more effective in frontal and memory domains than the other subgroup (SNSB-D &lt; 100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Withdrawal rates due to adverse events were very low (4.16%) </plain></SENT>
