<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the sleep-promoting, thermoregulatory, and circadian phase-shifting actions of passive body heating (PBH) in elderly insomniac patients (IPs) with mild-to-moderate vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen elderly IPs with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (mean age 76.9 years; male/female ratio 2/11) were subjected to a PBH trial session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This session comprised a 3-day baseline period, 2-day PBH period, and 1-day post-PBH period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the PBH period, the subjects received PBH (immersion in hot water about 40.0 degrees C to mid-thorax level) for 30 minutes beginning 2 hours before bedtime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sleep-waking, estimated by actigraph, core body temperature (cBT), and heart rate variability were continuously monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dim-light <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> time (DLMO) was determined in the baseline and post-PBH periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PBH significantly improved subjects' sleep quality; sleep latency decreased; sleep efficiency increased; and wake time after sleep <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These trends were more prominent in the latter half of the sleep time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PBH induced a rapid cBT elevation of approximately 0.80 degrees C, on average, followed by enhanced heat loss (DeltacBT: difference in cBT between just after the PBH and bedtime), lasting 1.5 hours before sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly positive correlation between DeltacBT and sleep latency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PBH induced no significant phase shift in DLMO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Heart-rate variability data showed that PBH induced parasympathomimetic action during sleep time in the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PBH may have a sleep-promoting effect by intervening in the thermoregulatory and autonomic systems in elderly IPs with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
