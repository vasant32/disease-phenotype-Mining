<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) levels and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GPx) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> reductase (GR) activities in blood samples from patients with AD and VD and in healthy non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> controls (CTR) which similar ages to the patients, in order to evaluate the degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in patients with AD and VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A sample of 150 subjects consisting of 50 patients with AD; 50 patients with VD and 50 CTR, aged from 65 to 85 years on, was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of the changes observed were in SOD activity and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Catalase activity were least affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were observed in SOD and GR activity between males and females in CRT and in patients with AD, but not in VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have found a decrease in <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes activities (SOD, CAT, GPx and GR) in patients with AD and VD and significant differences were observed between CRT and AD patients for ages from 65 to 74, 75 to 84 and from 85 years to 94 years in SOD activity and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels increase with age in VD, AD and CTR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant variation with respect to sex were detected, but significant variations in <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels were detected between CRT and patients with VD and AD (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> plays an important role in the brain damage for both AD and VD, being observed higher levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> for AD that for VD </plain></SENT>
