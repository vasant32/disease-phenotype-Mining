<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to characterize cognitive function in subjects with a C475T (R133C) mutation in the Notch3 gene, leading to CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prestroke (n=13) and poststroke (n=13) mutation carriers and mutation carriers with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n=8) were compared with healthy noncarriers from the same families using a comprehensive set of neuropsychological tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Changes in working memory and executive function were observed in the very early phase of the disease before <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Later, in the poststroke phase, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> concerned also mental speed and visuospatial ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, the subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> had multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo>, which engaged even verbal functions, verbal episodic memory, and motor speed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 2 mutation carrier groups without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and the controls could be reliably distinguished using 3 tests that assessed working memory/attention, executive function, and mental speed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Episodic memory was relatively well-preserved late in the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A deterioration of working memory and executive function was already observed in the prestroke phase, which means that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> may start insidiously before the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptomatic ischemic episodes </plain></SENT>
