<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Community-based <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> case-finding method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Piraju, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-five community health workers were trained to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases in 2,222 people aged 65 and older in Piraju, a Brazilian town with 27,871 inhabitants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: After the training, the health workers prepared a list of possible cases that afterward an experienced psychiatrist clinically evaluated, according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e>, Fourth Edition (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV), criteria and the Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 72 cases that were clinically assessed, 45 met the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV diagnostic criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the positive predictive value of this case finding method was 62.5%; the estimated frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most of the confirmed cases met clinical criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This simple method was appropriate to identify cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the general population and can possibly be extended to other developing countries with limited resources to be applied in health programs </plain></SENT>
