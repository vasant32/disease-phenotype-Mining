<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Alzheimer <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) are the most common causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> is an important co-morbid disorder in these diseases, which is often challenging to recognize </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in patients with AD and VD and estimated the influence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> on the health-related quality of life (HrQoL) in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in consecutively recruited patients with AD or VD (n= 98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> was diagnosed according to criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV) and scored using the Geriatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The EuroQol (EQ-5D and visual analogue scale) was applied to evaluate HrQoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> was measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis was used to identify factors predicting severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in AD/VD was 87% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In comparison to the general population, HrQoL measured on the visual analogue scale was reduced by 54% in patients with AD/VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the dimension "<z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>" of the EQ-5D, 81% of patients with AD/VD had moderate or severe problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> showed significant association with reduced HrQoL (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors of more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> were older age, male gender, better MMSE scores and being not married </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> is a prevalent psychiatric co-morbidity in patients with AD/VD, which is often under-diagnosed being masked by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> is a predictor of reduced HrQoL in elder people with AD/VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Therefore, they should be screened for presence of depressive symptoms and receive adequate antidepressant treatment </plain></SENT>
