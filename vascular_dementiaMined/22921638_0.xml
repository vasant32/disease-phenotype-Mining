<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated opinions of European nephrologists on the decision for when to start RRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: European web-based survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PREDICTORS: Patient presentations described as uncomplicated patients, patients with unfavorable clinical and unfavorable social conditions, or patients with specific clinical, social, and logistical factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING &amp; PARTICIPANTS: Nephrologists from 11 European countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OUTCOMES &amp; MEASUREMENTS: We studied opinions of European nephrologists about the influence of clinical, social, and logistical factors on decision making regarding when to start RRT, reflecting practices in place in 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Questions included target levels of kidney function at the start of RRT and factors accelerating or postponing RRT initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using linear regression, we studied determinants of target estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at the start of RRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We received 433 completed surveys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median target eGFR selected to start RRT in uncomplicated patients was 10.0 (25th-75th percentile, 8.0-10.0) mL/min/1.73 m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Level of excretory kidney function was considered the most important factor in decision making regarding uncomplicated patients (selected by 54% of respondents); in patients with unfavorable clinical versus social conditions, this factor was selected by 24% versus 32%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> clinical factors such as life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0002153'>hyperkalemia</z:hpo> refractory to medical therapy (100%) and uremic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001701'>pericarditis</z:hpo> (98%) elicited a preference for an immediate start, whereas patient preference (69%) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (66%) postponed the start </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Higher target eGFRs were reported by respondents from high- versus low-RRT-incidence countries (10.4 [95% CI, 9.9-10.9] vs 9.1 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) and from for-profit versus not-for-profit centers (10.1 [95% CI, 9.5-10.7] vs 9.5 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: We were unable to calculate the exact response rate and examined opinions rather than practice for 433 nephrologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Only for uncomplicated patients did half the nephrologists consider excretory kidney function as the most important factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Future studies should assess the weight of each factor affecting decision making </plain></SENT>
