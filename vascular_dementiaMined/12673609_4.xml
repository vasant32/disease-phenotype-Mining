<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the presence of different dimensions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in subjects with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: After a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, cognitive, affective and behavioural disturbances are common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that the nature of affective symptomatology can help to differentiate organic from psychological <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cognitive and affective symptoms were assessed in 78 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and a principal component analysis was performed on these symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, a discriminant analysis was carried out to establish the contribution of different symptoms on the diagnosis '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0868892,C0868894,C0011581,C0012706,C0868893" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">depressive disorder</z:e>' and '<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) Principal component analysis revealed three distinct sub-syndromes: one with predominantly mood symptoms, one with essentially <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679464" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychomotor symptoms</z:e>, and one with vegetative symptoms; (2) mood, psychomotor and vegetative symptoms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> independently and strongly related to a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1269683" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="MDD">major depressive disorder</z:e> according to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R criteria; (3) the psychomotor factor was also firmly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; and (4) discriminant analysis gave further support for our conclusion that some of the depressive features, in particular the psychomotor factor, are at least partly related to the organic brain damage from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results indicate that different dimensions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> could be discerned in a group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and that the symptom profile of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in these patients can be affected by the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
