<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy of Single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">Photon</z:chebi> Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) scanning in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> (AD) and its capacity to improve the diagnostic accuracy of conventional clinical evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Comparison of SPECT scanning of AD and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects with the criterion standard of clinical diagnosis confirmed by 1-year repeated evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A memory clinic in a tertiary care university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: One hundred twenty patients were evaluated upon entering the Jewish General Hospital (McGill University) Memory Clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight patients were diagnosed as having AD and 17 as having vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty unmatched controls (recruited mainly through newspaper advertisements) were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and 25 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (not included in the statistical analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparison of visual inspection of SPECT, based on the system of classification developed by Holman et al., using B pattern alone as positive or B (bilateral posterior temporal and/or parietal cortex deficits) or C (bilateral posterior temporal and/or parietal deficits with additional defects) pattern and B or C or D (unilateral posterior temporal and/or parietal defects with or without additional defects) as positive compared with clinical diagnosis after repeated evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity, as well as positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) and negative predictive value (NPV) based on the prevalence of AD in a memory clinic setting of 30% or 50%, were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With B pattern as positive, the sensitivity of SPECT was 21% whereas the specificity was 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With B or C as positive, the sensitivity was 29% and the specificity was 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With B or C or D as positive, the sensitivity was 55% and the specificity was 65% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With a 30% prevalence, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> with B pattern as positive was 31% whereas the NPV was 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> with B or C as positive was 33% while the NPV was 29%, and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> with B or C or D as positive was 40% whereas the NPV was 23% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>With a 50% prevalence, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> with B pattern as positive was 51% and the NPV 49.6%; the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> with B or C as positive was 54% and the NPV 48.6%; the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> with B or C or D as positive was 61% while NPV was 41% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The sensitivity and specificity were too low for SPECT to be useful as a diagnostic test for AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The poor positive and negative predictive values in our tertiary care clinic mean that SPECT is not useful in "ruling-in" or "ruling-out" AD in that setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In fact, clinical evaluation is more accurate </plain></SENT>
