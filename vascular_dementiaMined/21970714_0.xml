<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system cholesterol cannot be degraded but is secreted into circulation predominantly in the form of its polar metabolite 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OH-Chol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some studies suggested an association between 24S-OH-Chol metabolism and different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A possible decrease in 24S-OH-Chol plasma levels has been reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (LOAD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), but results of previous studies are partially contradictory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: By high-speed liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry we evaluated the plasma levels of 24S-OH-Chol in a sample of 160 older individuals: 60 patients with LOAD, 35 patients with VD, 25 subjects affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> no-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (CIND), and 40 (144 for genetics study) cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also investigated the possible association between PPARgamma Pro12Ala polymorphism and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or 24S-OH-Chol levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with Controls, plasma 24S-OH-Chol levels were higher in LOAD and lower in VD; a slight not-significant increase in CIND was observed (ANOVA p: 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation between 24S-OH-Chol/TC ratio and plasma C reactive protein (CRP) levels was found in the whole sample, independent of possible confounders (multiple regression p: 0.04; r2: 0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This correlation was strong in LOAD (r: 0.39), still present in CIND (r: 0.20), but was absent in VD patients (r: 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The PPARgamma Pro12Ala polymorphism was not associated with the diagnosis of LOAD, VD, or CIND; no correlation emerged between the Ala allele and 24S-OH-Chol plasma levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that plasma 24S-OH-Chol levels might be increased in the first stages of LOAD, and this phenomenon might be related with systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The finding of lower 24S-OH-Chol concentrations in VD might be related with a more advanced stage of VD compared with LOAD in our sample, and/or to different pathogenetic mechanisms and evolution of these two forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
