<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors studied serum levels of copper, ceruloplasmin, and transferrin, as well as total <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi>, and other peripheral markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in 47 patients with AD, 24 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), and 44 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biochemical variables were related to the patients' and controls' clinical status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The authors found that copper (p &lt; 0.001), <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxides</z:chebi> (p = 0.026), and ceruloplasmin (p = 0.052) were increased and TRAP was decreased (p = 0.006) in patients with AD, while no other markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The calculation of the ratio between copper and ceruloplasmin suggested the presence in the serum of AD patients, but not of VaD or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, of a large pool of non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Changes in the distribution of the serum copper components, consisting of an increase of a copper fraction not explained by ceruloplasmin, seem to be characteristic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> and may be implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease </plain></SENT>
