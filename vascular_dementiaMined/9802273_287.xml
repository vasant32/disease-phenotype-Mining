<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Systolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> increases the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in elderly people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> project, set up in the framework of the double-blind placebo-controlled Systolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> in Europe (Syst-Eur) trial, investigated whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drug</z:chebi> treatment could reduce the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eligible patients had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, were at least 60 years old, and had a blood pressure when seated of 160-219 mm Hg systolic and below 95 mm Hg diastolic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Active treatment consisted of nitrendipine (10-40 mg/day) with the possible addition of enalapril (5-20 mg/day), hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg/day), or both drugs, titrated or combined to reduce the systolic blood pressure by at least 20 mm Hg to reach a value below 150 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cognitive function was assessed by the mini mental state examination (MMSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If the MMSE score was 23 or less, diagnostic tests for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were done (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R criteria) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was established by the modified ischaemic score with brain imaging or the Hachinski score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Median follow-up by intention to treat was 2.0 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with placebo (n=1180), active treatment (n=1238) reduced the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> by 50% from 7.7 to 3.8 cases per 1000 patient-years (21 vs 11 patients, p=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median MMSE score at randomisation was 29 in both treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the last available assessment, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were, respectively, 8.3 mm Hg and 3.8 mm Hg lower (p&lt;0.001) in the active-treatment group, but on average the MMSE scores did not change in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the control patients, however, the MMSE decreased (p=0.04) with decreasing diastolic blood pressure, whereas in the active-treatment group MMSE scores improved slightly (p=0.01) with greater reduction in diastolic blood pressure (p=0.002 for between-group difference) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: In elderly people with isolated systolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment was associated with a lower incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>If 1000 hypertensive patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi> for 5 years 19 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> might be prevented </plain></SENT>
