<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of nicardipine on the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in patients with VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We selected outpatients, of both sexes, between 55 and 80 years old, with VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following a placebo wash-out period (4 weeks), the patients received nicardipine 20 mg t.i.d. or placebo for one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy variable was the loss of over 10% of the basal score on the Mini-Mental State Examination after one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The time it took to reach this degree of impairment, the evolution of Pfeiffer score, the effect on functional disability and the drug safety were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 156 patients were included, 109 completed the study, and 142 underwent intent-to-treat analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the end of the study, 34.6% of patients with placebo and 21.1% with nicardipine had lost over 10% of their basal MMSE score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Favorable effects of nicardipine were found on females (40.9% vs 10.5%, p = 0.01876), patients without previous treatments (46.2% vs 13.3%, p = 0.00748) and patients with concomitant antiplatelet treatment (35.0% vs 15.9; p = 0.03836) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Survival analysis showed that the patients with nicardipine took longer to lose cognitive capacities (p = 0.031; RR = 1.15-3.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Nicardipine did not reduce the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> at the stated period in the total group but it significantly delayed this decline and produces better evolution in females, in patients without previous treatments, and those with antiplatelet treatment </plain></SENT>
