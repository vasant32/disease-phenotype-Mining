<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous investigations demonstrated that the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) patients contains antibodies that recognize specific neuronal populations in the adult rat central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a pathogenic role for immunological aberrations in this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine if antibodies may provide a means to differentially diagnose the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>, CSF from a diversified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> population was screened against the developing rat <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> and a cell culture system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Markings produced by AD CSF were distinctly different from those of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> (VAD) against the developing rat <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More importantly, some AD CSF recognized amoeboid microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The recognition of amoeboid microglia by antibodies in AD CSF is particularly interesting since these cells proliferate in response to <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disease and also engulf debris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A cell culture technique was developed to allow the rapid screening of CSF antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patient CSF produced five different types of markings in the cell culture: microglia, glioblasts, fibers, nonspecific, or negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Correlations with these structures and the diagnosis of four different <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> populations revealed that, in comparison to the other groups, AD CSF displayed remarkable selectivity toward microglial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cortical biopsies from patients suspected to have AD were incubated with the patient's own CSF and that of confirmed AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both CSF samples recognized microglial cells in the patient's cortical biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The same CSF samples incubated against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human cortical autopsy or a biopsy from a 3-mo-old child displayed negative immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These three approaches suggest that the presence of CSF microglial antibodies may be a means to distinguish AD patients from other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results add further support to the widely growing concept that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and similar immune mechanisms may contribute to AD pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
