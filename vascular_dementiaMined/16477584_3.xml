<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Because <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> share common risk factors, we investigated risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in Arab subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a cross-sectional population-based study, we conducted a door-to-door survey of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> adults over age 60 in an Arab community of rural Israel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted interviews, gave questionnaires, and collected DNA blood specimens for determination of ApoE genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 823 individuals in this naturalistic sample, 168 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer's type (DAT) and 49 had VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vascular risk factors, including the ApoE-epsilon4 allele, were more prevalent among VaD than DAT subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Depressive symptoms were present in 57% of DAT patients and 86% of VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Depressed DAT individuals had a greater history of ischemic cardiovascular or cerebrovascular (CV/CBV) disease than non-depressed DAT subjects, but depressed DAT subjects were less likely to have the ApoE-epsilon4 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within the VaD group, there was no difference in the distribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in individuals with and without depressive symptoms, and ApoE-epsilon4 was more prevalent among subjects with depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptomatology is prevalent among subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> in this Arab community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>History of CV/CBV is associated with the presence of depressive symptoms in DAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to clarify the role of ApoE in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in different ethnic groups with DAT </plain></SENT>
