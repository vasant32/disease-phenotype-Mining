<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anti-GM1 concentrations were measured in the sera of 33 demented patients with a male-to-female ratio of 1:2.7 (the mean age was 69.7 years for males and 70.1 years for females) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty-two percent of the patients revealed increased values of anti-GM1, but only 18.2% demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-nine percent of the patients suffered from vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most severely <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients demonstrated a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 5 to 23 out of 30 and revealed the most increased levels of anti-GM1 (&gt;40 EU/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The findings of this study are indicative of a possible correlation between the levels of anti-GM1 and the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, mainly of the vascular type </plain></SENT>
