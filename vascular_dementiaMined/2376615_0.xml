<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Then the correlations between the degrees of mental function (Hasegawa's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rating scale: HDRS, activity of daily living: ADL, troublesome behaviors: TB) and the CT findings of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were examined retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A hundred and seventeen <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients (male: 79 cases, female: 38 cases; mean-age 69.5 +/- 10.9 years old), diagnosed using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III criteria, were scored according to Hachinski's ischemic score (I.S.) by clinical course and symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both MRI and CT were carried out on 56 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases (male: 21 cases, female: 35 cases; mean-age 78.0 +/- 7.4 years old) at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage of the cerebro-vascular accidents to compare the detectiveness of vascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 90 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients on whom only CT was carried out, the imagings were classified according to number, size, and localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The correlation between these parameters and the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were examined retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRI was more useful and sensitive than CT for differentiating VD from DAT (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer type), since MRI was superior to CT in detecting small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> or lacunaes on the perforating area or white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cases with positive findings on CT or MRI but clinically diagnosed as DAT by I.S. showed poorer ADL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
