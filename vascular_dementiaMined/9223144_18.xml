<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IVD and NC participants performed better on category than letter WLG tasks, whereas the opposite was observed among AD participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IVD participants produced fewer responses than AD participants on letter WLG tasks, but there was no difference between AD and IVD participants on the "animal" WLG task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AD participants scored lower than IVD and NC participants on animal WLG indexes measuring semantic knowledge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were few differences between IVD and NC participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reduced output on the animal WLG task for IVD participants is consistent with search-retrieval deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reduced output of AD participants may be caused by degraded semantic knowledge </plain></SENT>
