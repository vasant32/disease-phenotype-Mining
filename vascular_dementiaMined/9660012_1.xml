<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventeen cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in the perforating artery areas (vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, mean age 67.0), 6 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (mean age 69.5) and 8 healthy controls (mean age 62.5) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flows in the frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital cortex, frontal, temporal and occipital white matter, caudate nucleus, putamen and thalamus were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The amplitude of early CNV was significantly smaller in the vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> group than in the healthy control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The blood flows in the parietal cortex and thalamus were significantly lower in the vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> group than in the healthy control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant positive correlation between the amplitude of early CNV and frontal cortex blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant correlations were present between the CNV and the other regional cerebral blood flows nor in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The amplitude of CNV has been reported to be decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From the present study, the amplitude of early CNV was considered to be influenced by the blood flow in the frontal cortex </plain></SENT>
