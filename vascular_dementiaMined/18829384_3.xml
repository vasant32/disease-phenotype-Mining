<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Central cholinergic circuits of human brain can be tested non-invasively by coupling peripheral nerve stimulation with transcranial magnetic stimulation of motor cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This test, named short latency afferent inhibition (SAI) has been shown in healthy subjects to be sensitive to the blockage of muscarinic <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> receptors and it is impaired in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) patients, a cholinergic form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, while it is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in non-cholinergic forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> such as fronto-temporal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of present study was to evaluate central cholinergic circuits in patients with Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated SAI in a group of patients with VaD and compared the data with those from a group of AD patients and a control group of age-matched healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean SAI was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in VaD patients while it was significantly reduced in AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The analysis of individual data showed abnormal SAI in 75% of AD and in only 25% of VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SAI is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in most of VaD patients in contrast with AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This test might be used for the functional evaluation of central cholinergic circuits in VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: SAI testing may represent a useful additional tool for the evaluation of patients with VaD however, further studies are required in order to evaluate whether this method can be used for the differential diagnosis between pure VaD and different forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
