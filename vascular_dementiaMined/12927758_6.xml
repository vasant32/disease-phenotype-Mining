<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We recently detected cytomegalovirus (CMV) in brains of 83% of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) patients and 34% of age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since CMV and also Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cpn) have been found in some studies to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (which shares several risk factors with VaD), we sought Cpn DNA in VaD brain DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined brain specimens from 19 VaD patients, 16 elderly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> people and four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) patients for the presence of a sequence in the Cpn gene for rRNA, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and taking stringent precautions against contamination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We did not detect Cpn DNA in any of the brain specimens, the sensitivity of detection being 10 copies or fewer <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> DNA sequences per tube or, in terms of infectious units (IFU), 0.025 IFU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results do not support a role for Cpn in the aetiology of VaD, either in the 83% of patients in whose brains we detected CMV, or in the remaining 17% without CMV in brain </plain></SENT>
