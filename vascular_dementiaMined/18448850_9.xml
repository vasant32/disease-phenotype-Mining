<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of newer neuropathological techniques on the power of National Institute of Neurological and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009460" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Communicative Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-AD and Related Disorders Association criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) to detect AD at later postmortem study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We examined clinical and postmortem diagnoses of persons evaluated postmortem with thioflavin-S staining for plaques and tangles and immunohistochemical staining techniques for alpha synuclein, uhiquitin, and tau protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer Disease</z:hpo> Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Clinically evaluated persons for whom tissue diagnosis was available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 313 evaluees, 166 met criteria for probable AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An additional 59 subjects had clinical diagnoses that included AD, e.g., possible AD, Lewy body variant of AD, AD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>Parkinsonism</z:hpo>, and mixed AD and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 166 probable AD cases, 147 of 166 (88.6%) met pathologic criteria for AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five AD groups were combined, 194 of 225 subjects (86.2%) met pathologic criteria for AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were five cases diagnosed pathologically as tangle-only <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, which was considered a variant of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A pathologic diagnosis of Lewy body variant of AD was made in 56 (17.9%) of cases, including 44 of 313 (14.1%) cases diagnosed as probable or possible AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pure <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> was seen in 13 (4.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were 9 (2.9%) cases of mixed AD and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 37 (11.4%) cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: McKhann et al. criteria for probable and possible AD are valid for AD but do not exclude additional Lewy body pathology </plain></SENT>
