<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of rivastigmine capsules in patients diagnosed with probable vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: VantagE (Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> trial studying Exelon) was a 24-week, multicentre, double-blind study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>VaD patients aged 50-85 years were randomized to rivastigmine capsules (3-12 mg/day) or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Efficacy assessments included global and cognitive performances, activities of daily living and neuropsychiatric symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adverse events were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional exploratory analyses determined whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in pathologies and symptoms extended to differential treatment effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00099216 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 710 patients were randomized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rivastigmine demonstrated superiority over placebo on three measures of cognitive performance (Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Assessment Scale, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Assessment Scale cognitive subscale, Mini-Mental State Examination; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p&lt; or = 0.05, intent-to-treat population [ITT]), but not other outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Predominant adverse events were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Exploratory analyses indicated that older patients (&gt; or =75 years old), assumed more likely to also have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) pathology, demonstrated significant cognitive responses to rivastigmine and a safety profile similar to that seen in AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Younger patients, assumed less likely to have concomitant AD pathology, showed no efficacy response and were associated with slight elevations of blood pressure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Rivastigmine-placebo differences in patients with, versus those without, medial temporal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (also suggestive of concomitant AD) showed a numerical difference similar to that seen between the older versus younger patients, but did not attain statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Consistent with trials evaluating other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37733">cholinesterase inhibitors</z:chebi>, rivastigmine did not provide consistent efficacy in probable VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The efficacy apparent on cognitive outcomes was derived from effects in older patients likely to have concomitant Alzheimer pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This is supportive of an existing argument that the putative cholinergic deficit in VaD reflects the presence of concomitant Alzheimer pathology </plain></SENT>
