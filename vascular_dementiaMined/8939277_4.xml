<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) may occur as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> superimposed on presymptomatic DAT, in which case APOE-epsilon 4 frequency should also be increased in VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have examined the distribution of APOE-epsilon 4 in patients with DAT (n = 176) or VD (n = 74) and controls (n = 133), and evaluated the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> associated with APOE-epsilon 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>APOE-epsilon 4 allele frequency was 27% in DAT patients, 21% in VD patients, and 11% in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference in the distribution of the epsilon 4 allele between DAT or VD patients and controls was statistically significant (chi(2) test, p &lt; 0.05), with a 3.6- and 2.1-fold risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in DAT and VD patients carrying an epsilon 4 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The result that the APOE-epsilon 4 allele is more frequent in DAT patients than in controls, with VD patients falling in between, is consistent with the assumption that VD is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> condition, with some patients having an underlying preclinical brain degeneration, in whom the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was precipitated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
