<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper has reviewed comparatively the incidence of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> is associated with cerebrovascular disease, which is in turn associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is the most important modifiable risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which is a recognized cause of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In terms of pathophysiology of hypertensive brain damage, several hypotheses were developed, such as that vascular alterations induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> can induce lacunar or cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and leucoaraiosis, that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is responsible for cerebrovascular disease and acts into the contest of a pre-existing subclinic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> determines neurobiologic alterations (such as beta-amyloid accumulation) resulting in neuropathologic damage, and that aging and cerebrovascular risk factors act together to cause cerebral capillary degeneration, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> disruption, reduced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation, and reduced ATP synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The consequence of these alterations are neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Macroscopic results of these mechanisms are the so-called white matter lesions (WML), the significance of which is analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increasing clinical evidence suggests a close relationship between the reduction of elevated blood pressure and countering of both vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">Antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment probably influences cognitive performances and prevents cognitive function alterations and the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is therefore important to evaluate as soon as possible cognitive functions of hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
