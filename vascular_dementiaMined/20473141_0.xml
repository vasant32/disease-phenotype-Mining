<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few reported the mortality and predictive factors on survival of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in Asia, especially China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To characterize the epidemiologic pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in Shanghai, China, including prevalence and survival, we conducted a cross-sectional, population-based survey among Shanghai residents (&gt; or =55 y) and followed a subsample for up to 40 months for survival analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A stratified, multistage cluster sampling design was adopted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Crude and age-standardized prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 2.99% and 2.66%, respectively, higher in women and increased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of Alzheimer was higher than vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> was more prevalent in rural areas than in urban, whereas geographic distribution of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was quite the opposite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Crude and age-standardized mortality of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 6.06 and 5.30 per 1000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a striking difference in survival between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> and nondemented, whereas no significant survival discrepancy existed between Alzheimer and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Factors including overall physical and cognitive function, age, and severity of disease strongly influenced survival and might be predictors for fatal events in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiologic pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in Shanghai, China is similar to that of western countries </plain></SENT>
