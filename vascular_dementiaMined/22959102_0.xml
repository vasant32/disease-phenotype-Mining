<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) is one of the most prevalent causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and it is frequently misdiagnosed and undertreated in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because neuropsychological outcome depends, among other factors, on the size and location of the vascular brain injury, characterizing the cognitive profile of VaD has been especially challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Yet, there has been sufficient evidence to show a marked <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238707" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">impairment of attention</z:e> and executive functions, in particular in relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Being able to detect these deficits at bedside is crucial for everyday clinical practice, and yet, brief cognitive screening toots such as the Mini-Mental Sate Examination (MMSE) may overlook at <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> typical of patients with VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination Revised (ACE-R) is also a brief cognitive screening tool designed to incorporate the items of the MMSE and further extend the test to assess orientation, attention, verbal fluency, memory, language, and visuospatial abilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the ability of the Spanish version of the ACE-R to detect the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> showed in patients with subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and we compared its usefulness to that of the MMSE in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Scores on these tests were compared to those of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> and matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 88-point cut-off proposed for the ACE-R was associated with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 100% for the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, demonstrating a stronger capacity than the MMSE (sensitivity of 42% with its 23-point cut-off score) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also found that the verbal fluency subtest of the ACE-R may be potentially useful in discriminating patients with subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> from patients with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We discuss the utility of these findings in the context of everyday clinical practice and we propose that future studies should evaluate the potential usefulness of combining the ACE-R with a brief screening tool of executive functioning </plain></SENT>
