<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether IL-1alpha -889 C/T and IL-1beta -511 C/T promoter polymorphisms are associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: AD patients (n = 219) and VaD patients (n = 82), who fulfilled the criteria of the NINCDS-ADRDA and NINDS-AIREN, and ethnic-matched and nondemented controls (n = 209) were analyzed by means of genotype association method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant difference in the genotype distribution of the analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms was found between AD or VaD cases and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the frequency of the IL-1alpha -889 CT genotype was notably lower in VaD patients aged over 70 years than the age-matched controls (9.1 vs. 22.9%, p = 0.036) andtheIL-1alpha -889 CT genotype demonstrated a trend toward decrease in risk of developing VaD (odds ratio: 0.34; 95% confidence interval: 0.12-0.83, p = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that the IL-1beta -511T-carrying genotype slightly strengthens the negative association of the IL-1alpha -889 CT genotype with VaD (odds ratio: 0.26; 95% confidence interval: 0.08-0.79, p = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a protective role of the IL-1alpha -889 CT genotype in VaD susceptibility among Taiwanese aged over 70 years </plain></SENT>
