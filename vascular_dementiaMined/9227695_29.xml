<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although increasing attention is being paid to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e>, a form of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> characterized by diffuse white matter lesions, only limited information is available on the pathological changes that occur in the glia and axons in the white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the brains of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> to gain further insight into its pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Autopsied brains from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> (group 3; n = 17) were compared with those of nonneurological controls (group 1; n = 5) and controls with large cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> but without significant white matter lesions (group 2; n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was used as an immunohistochemical marker for astroglia, leukocyte common antigen (LCA) was used as a marker for microglia, and HLA-DR was used as a marker for activated microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Axonal damage was assessed by the accumulation of proteins, which are transported by fast axonal flow, amyloid protein precursor (APP), synaptophysin, and chromogranin A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although there was no difference in numerical density of GFAP-immunoreactive astroglia in each group, regressive astroglia were observed in 7 of 17 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LCA-immunoreactive microglia were 1.7 times more numerous in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> than in group 1 (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HLA-DR-immunoreactive-activated microglia were 3.4 times and 2.1 times more numerous in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> as compared with group 1 (P &lt; .01) and group 2 (P &lt; .05), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was frequent perivascular lymphocyte cuffing, and clusters of macrophages with a decreased number of oligodendroglia were observed in the rarefied white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The grading scores for the number of axons immunoreactive for either APP, synaptophysin, or chromogranin A were significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> than in group 1 or 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The pathological alterations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger</z:e>'s diseased brains include regressive changes in the astroglia and activation of the microglia with a decrease in the oligodendroglia, which were associated with the degradation of both myelin and axonal components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that an inflammatory reaction and compromised axonal transport, mediated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, may play an important role in the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
