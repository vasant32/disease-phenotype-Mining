<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) accounted for 86.7% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinically diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients, whereas no cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) were neuropathologically demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six years later, we undertook a similar study, in order to re-evaluate the frequency of the different causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in our country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied 611 adult brains obtained from autopsies performed during the period 1992-1998; 39 of these came from clinically <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was disclosed in 33 cases (84.6%), five cases (12.82%) showed evidence of specific causes for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> other than VD or AD, and in one of the cases (2.56%) the neuropathological changes were specific for AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our current results confirm the conclusions of our previous study and contrast with the vast majority of reports in the medical literature regarding the frequency of the different causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, except for studies from China, Japan and Russia that yielded similar findings as ours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At present, further investigations are being undertaken in order to come up with possible explanations for these differences </plain></SENT>
