<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of warmth-promotion needling on cerebral malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) content, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity so as to explore its underlying mechanism in improving vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty Wistar rats were randomized into control, model, medication, needle-twirling and warmth-promotion groups with 8 cases in each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>VD model was established by occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries and reperfusion in combination with intraperitoneal injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> (2.5 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Warmth-promotion needling was applied to "Dazhui" (GV 14), "Baihui" (GV 20) and "Shuigou" (GV 26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats of medication group were intragastric perfusion of Nimodipine suspension (0.0108 g/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The treatment was given once daily continuously for 15 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SOD and AChE activity and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> content of the brain (right side) tissue were detected with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> oxidase method, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15429">hydroxylamine</z:chebi> chromatometry and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29830">thio</z:chebi>-malonylurea method separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In comparison with control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SOD activity of model group decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.01), AChE activity and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> content increased considerably (P &lt; 0.01); while compared with model group, SOD activity of warmth-promotion, needle-twirling and medication groups raised evidently (P &lt; 0.01), AChE activity and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> content of the later 3 groups lowered significantly (P &lt; 0.05, 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effects of warmth-promotion group were significantly superior to that of medication group in lowering <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> content and to those of needle-twirling group in raising SOD activity and lowering AChE activity and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> content (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Warmth-promotion needling can function well in resisting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation injury and lowering AChE activity in VD rats, which may contribute to its effect in improving learning-memory ability </plain></SENT>
