<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether in late life serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) predicts risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the prospective relationship of serum TSH with the risk of developing mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) in an elderly cohort with a 4-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data are for 660 subjects aged 65 years and older from an Italian population-based cohort who were cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at an extensive assessment in 1999/2000 and underwent follow-up assessment in 2003/2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum TSH was measured at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multinomial logistic models adjusted for sociodemographic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> were used to investigate the association of serum TSH (both as a tertile and continuous log-transformed variable) with risk of incident MCI, AD and VaD diagnosed according to international criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over 3.8 Â± 0.7 years of follow-up, there were 149 incident MCI cases (77 with impairment of memory and 72 with impairment of nonmemory domains) and 86 incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases (53 with AD, 28 with VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No association between baseline TSH and risk of developing any MCI subtype or AD was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The highest TSH tertile had a threefold higher increased risk of VaD (OR: 3.25, 95% CI: 1.01-10.77, p = 0.048) compared to the lowest tertile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Risk of VaD increased about 60% for each 1 SD increase in log-transformed TSH (OR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.06-2.44, p = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this elderly cohort, baseline TSH was not related to the risk of developing MCI or AD, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0002925'>high TSH</z:hpo> was associated with an increased risk of VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest further need for research using larger samples to examine the role of TSH as a predictor of VaD and the role of thyroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
