<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> at the age of 45 to 50 years may predispose to AD later in life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is not known whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> after age 65 years also contributes to AD risk, and its effect on cognitive function is also not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were analyzed from 1,259 Medicare recipients free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in a longitudinal study covering a 7-year period (1991 to 1998) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was first examined in relationship to the risk for incident AD and then to incident vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) using Cox proportional hazards models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in performance over time on tasks of memory, language, and visuospatial/cognitive function were compared in those with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> using generalized estimating equations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 1,259 subjects, 731 (58.1%) had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was not associated with an increased risk for AD (rate ratio [RR] 0.9, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.3) but was associated with an increased risk for VaD (1.8 [1.0 to 3.2]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was not associated with changes in memory, language, and general cognitive function in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with individuals with neither <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> nor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> alone had no increase in risk for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, when both were present, there was a threefold increase in risk for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A sixfold increase in risk was observed when both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> after age 65 years is not associated with AD and does not adversely affect memory, language, or general cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> may be an antecedent to VaD, particularly in the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
