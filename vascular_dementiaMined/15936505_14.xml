<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured levels of total tau (T-tau), phospho-tau (P-tau), Abeta(1-42), IL-6, and TNFalpha in CSF in groups of AD, VD, and controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T-tau level was found significantly higher in groups of AD (t = 3.015, P &lt; 0.01) and VD (t = 2.872, P &lt; 0.01) than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IL-6 level as also higher in AD (t = 2.883, P &lt; 0.01) and VD (t = 3.032, P &lt; 0.01) than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both T-tau and IL-6 were not significantly different between AD and VD (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The group of AD had remarkably higher P-tau (t = 4.261 and 3.883, respectively, P &lt; 0.01) and lower Abeta(1-42) (t = 3.883 and 4.129, respectively, P &lt; 0.01), as compared with those in VD and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TNFalpha level in AD was significantly higher than that in controls (t = 2.745, P &lt; 0.01), but lower than in VD (t = 3.032, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggested that increment of T-tau and IL-6 levels in CSF was useful for screening AD and VD in certain population, while descending Abeta(1-42) and ascending TNFalpha in CSF are preferable to diagnose AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, a higher level of CSF P-tau might support AD diagnosis </plain></SENT>
