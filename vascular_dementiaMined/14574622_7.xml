<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The enzyme mediating this conversion has been characterized at the molecular level (CYP46) and is mainly located in neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Like other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53030">oxysterols</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">24S-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi> is efficiently converted into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> or excreted in bile in its sulfated and glucuronidated form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">24S-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi> in the circulation decrease with age in infants and children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In adults, however, the levels appear to be stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is accumulating evidence pointing toward a potentially important link between cholesterol, beta-amyloid, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">24S-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi> in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients at early stages of the disease compared to healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Variations in genetic background, time of disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are potential sources of variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis, also termed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>, seem to have a reductive influence on the generation of the amyloid precursor protein, the neuronal secretion of beta-amyloid, and on de novo cholesterol synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recent epidemiological studies indicate that the prevalence of diagnosed AD and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is reduced among people taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> for a longer period of time </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CSF levels of cholesterol and lathosterol, a cholesterol precursor considered to be an indicator for cholesterol neogenesis, were significantly decreased in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi>-treated subjects compared to non-treated normo- and hypercholesterolemic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Also, CSF concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">24S-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi> were significantly lower in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi>-treated patients compared to normocholesterolemic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Treatment with high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> in normocholesterolemic Alzheimer patients for 26 weeks at early stages of the disease results in a significant decrease in Abeta-levels in cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This decrease correlates with the reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">24S-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
