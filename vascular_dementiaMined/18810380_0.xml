<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The regional corpus callosum area and cortical grey matter volumes were measured in 30 patients with the clinical diagnosis of probable AD, 20 patients with the clinical diagnosis of probable VD and 24 healthy elderly control subjects using MRI in two centers in Munich and Amsterdam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with AD showed significantly reduced volumes of cortical grey matter in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cerebral lobes and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of anterior and posterior corpus callosum areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In VD patients only occipital lobe grey matter volume and anterior corpus callosum area were significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In AD patients reduction of cortical grey matter volumes was significantly correlated with regional reductions of corpus callosum areas, but not in VD patients or controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings support the notion that measurement of the corpus callosum and cortical grey matter <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> may identify the underlying causes of cortical disconnection in AD and VD and may be helpful to differentiate between both conditions </plain></SENT>
