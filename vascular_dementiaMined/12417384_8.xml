<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) is a relatively homogeneous subtype of VaD, but the mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> of subcortical VaD are not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigates the changes of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in patients with subcortical VaD and the contribution of the white matter hyperintensity (WMHI) and clinical severity to CBF changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 99mTc-ethyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32457">cysteinate</z:chebi> dimer single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed to measure the regional CBF and statistical parametric mapping SPM99 software was applied to automated and objective analysis of the SPECT image data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients (12 male, 11 female) with mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> who met both the criteria of the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV and probable and possible NINDS-AIREN for VaD and had subcortical white matter changes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> in brain MRI were evaluated against 17 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects (7 male, 10 female) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The severity of the WMHI was measured by the semi-quantitative scale method proposed by MÃ¤ntyla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating scale measured the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SPM analysis of the SPECT image reveals significantly reduced regional CBF in the right thalamus, left caudate nucleus, cingulate, bilateral superior temporal, and left ventral subcallosal gyri in subcortical VaD patients compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (corrected P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of four WMHIs, only the deep WMHI was associated with the small CBF reduction in the left superior temporal gyrus (uncorrected P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reduction of the CBF according to the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was noted in the anterior and posterior association areas (uncorrected P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> of subcortical VaD may be related to the reduction of the CBF in the brain areas mentioned, which are probably not associated with the severity of periventricular WMHI and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
