<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine centers were involved, located across the whole country (3 in Northern, 3 in Central, and 3 in Southern Italy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic pathways were tracked for 474 patients with an expert diagnosis of neurodegenerative or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (age 76+/-8; 62% females; Mini-Mental State Examination 17.70+/-5.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The contribution of neuropsychology and structural neuroimaging to diagnosis was estimated as "number needed to test" (NNT), denoting the number of patients who need to undergo such procedures to improve expert diagnosis of 1 unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expert physicians reached their diagnosis without resorting to structural imaging examinations and neuropsychologic tests in 93% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) and 76% of non-AD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The completion of the extended assessment led to improvement of diagnostic accuracy in both cases: the NNT was 15.3 (95% confidence interval: 10.4-29.1) and 4.1 (3.0 to 6.5) for AD and non-AD diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The added value of structural imaging and neuropsychologic testing in the routine clinical assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients is substantial in both AD and non-AD cases </plain></SENT>
