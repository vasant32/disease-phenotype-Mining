<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-one SD rats were randomly divided into control (n=8), model A (n=8, no treatment) and B (n=8, intragastric perfusion of 15% saline), EA (n=9) and medication (n=8, intragastric perfusion of Nimoldipine, 12 mg/kg) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>VD model was established by using modified 4-vessels occlusion method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EA (150 Hz, 1-2 mA) was applied to "Baihui" (GV 20), "Dazhui" (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e> 14), "Pishu" (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> 20) and "Shenshu" (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> 23) for 20 min, once daily for 15 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> tests were conducted for evaluating the rats' learning-memory ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The contents of SS and beta-EP in plasma and brain tissue were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In comparison with sham-operation group, the escape latency (EL) prolonged significantly and the target-platform crossing times decreased remarkably (P&lt;0.01) in model group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In comparison with model group B, EL shortened and target-platform crossing times increased both significantly in EA and medication groups (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma and cerebral SS, and cerebral beta-EP contents of model groups A and B were significantly lower than those of sham-operation group(P&lt;0.01), while plasma beta-EP level had no obvious change (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Plasma and cerebral SS, and cerebral beta-EP contents in both EA and medication groups were considerably higher than those in model groups A and B (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between EA and medication groups in EL, target-platform crossing times, plasma and cerebral SS and beta-EP levels, and between model group A and model group B in plasma and cerebral SS and beta-EP levels (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EA can raise plasma and cerebral SS and cerebral beta-EP levels, and improve the learning-memory ability in VD rats </plain></SENT>
