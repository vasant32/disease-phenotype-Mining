<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE SUMMARIES: Case 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 78-year-old white man had probable Alzheimer <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> (verbal and physical) that was nonresponsive to antipsychotic, antidepressant, and mood stabilizer therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, conjugated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> 1.875 mg/d reduced his physical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo>, as evidenced by a 75% decline in aggressive episodes, per 24-hour nursing reports and progress notes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Case 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 78-year-old African-American man with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, physical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo>, and sexual inappropriateness was unsuccessfully managed with several antipsychotic and <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>He did, however, exhibit a decline in physical and sexual <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> by 80%, as well as a 55% reduction in sexual comments, after daily treatment with conjugated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> 0.625 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">Estrogen</z:chebi> was well tolerated by both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (January 1966-May 1998) and PsychLit (January 1974-May 1998) database searches were performed to identify case reports, letters, or clinical trials discussing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> use in aggressive elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: As with previous reports, these cases suggest that conjugated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> may be used to reduce physical and sexual <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in elderly men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additional study is needed to determine the exact role of this alternative pharmacologic intervention </plain></SENT>
