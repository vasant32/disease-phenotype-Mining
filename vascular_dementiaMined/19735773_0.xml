<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Senior homes; hospital; college campus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Participants (N=377; 114 men, 263 women) were recruited comprising healthy controls (n=201; 40 men, 161 women), subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n=93; 34 men, 59 women) including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (n=73) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n=20); subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychiatric illness</z:e> (n=35, 15 men, 20 women), specifically <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0007302'>bipolar disorder</z:hpo>; and subjects with other neurologic conditions (n=48, 25 men, 23 women) such as traumatic brain injury (n=12) and cerebrovascular disease (n=31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses were confirmed by physicians using appropriate criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recruitment was done in the northeastern region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In an effort to examine the reliability and validity of the revised QCST, participants were administered the revised QCST with a number of standardized measures (ie, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Assessment Scale-Cognitive, Mini-Mental State Examination, Tests of Oral Fluency, Trail-Making Test, and Functional Activities Questionnaire) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results revealed that the revised QCST discriminated between healthy controls and the neuropsychiatric participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the revised QCST significantly correlated with other standardized measures, confirming the revised QCST's reliability and validity as a screening instrument for subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The revised QCST provides the clinician with a short yet reliable screening instrument in detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and other neurologic conditions </plain></SENT>
