<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Findings indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) may have common risk factors and/or pathogenesis, but their interrelationships still need to be clearly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since ApoE4 imparts risk for both <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> and AD, it seemed worthwhile to investigate the possible role of ApoE in the pathogenesis of AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To this task, we examined in healthy volunteers, and AD and VaD patients: i) the frequency of ApoE isoforms; and ii) the influence of ApoE genotype on serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that epsilon4 allele is an important risk factor for the development not only of the Alzheimer type, but also of the vascular type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, epsilon2 allele could have a protective role in AD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results confirm the hypothesis that serum ApoE concentration is dependent on ApoE genotype, but do not support the view that it has to be considered a relevant biochemical marker for AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
