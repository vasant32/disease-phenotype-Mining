<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Demented</z:e> subjects were divided into three subgroups: early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AD group (EOAD; n=25, mean age 63.0+/-6.2 years), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> AD group (LOAD; n=33, mean age 79.3+/-5.1 years), and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> group (VD; n=45, mean age 75.3+/-8.0 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E phenotype was determined by isoelectric focusing and immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the distribution of the apo E phenotypes by gender or age, and the estimated frequencies of epsilon2, epsilon3 and epsilon4 were 0.05, 0.86 and 0.09, respectively, in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in the distribution of the apo E phenotypes between LOAD and elderly controls aged more than 65 years (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the apo E phenotypes in EOAD was the same as that in LOAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the epsilon4 allele was significantly higher in LOAD (0.35, P&lt;0.0001) and EOAD (0.28, P&lt;0.0001) than that in the control subjects (0.07), but not in VD (0.12, P=0.1630) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present findings suggest that ApoE4 is related with both EOAD and LOAD, but not with VD, and support the hypothesis that it is a genetic risk factor of AD </plain></SENT>
