<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subsequent changes in treatment or underlying disease may result in a delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of this adverse affect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective is to report on two cases of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> associated with concomitant use of diltiazem and other contributing factors, and to briefly review the related literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>COMMENT: A 63-year-old Chinese woman with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020445" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">familial hypercholesterolaemia</z:e> (FH) taking diltiazem 90 mg twice daily had elevation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase (CK) to 4016 U/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) to 165 IU/L 4 weeks after increasing the dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> from 40 to 80 mg daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Another 80-year-old Chinese woman with FH, mild vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was hospitalized with bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0007340'>lower limb weakness</z:hpo> associated with raised CK (8869 IU/L), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (1384 IU/L) and ALT (288 IU/L) after taking diltiazem 60 mg twice daily with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> 40 mg for 11 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statin</z:chebi>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> was suspected and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> was stopped in both cases, and symptoms resolved and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> laboratory parameters returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> in both cases is likely to have resulted from an interaction of higher doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> with diltiazem through inhibition of CYP3A enzymes and drug transporters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The strength of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi>-diltiazem interactions in the two cases estimated by the Drug Interaction Probability Scale (DIPS) indicated a possible association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: â€‚ The two cases reported here and the brief literature review emphasize the potential interaction between two drugs frequently coadministered, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> and diltiazem and we suggest that diltiazem should not be used with higher doses of those <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> metabolized by CYP3A such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> and even with lower doses caution should be exercised in patients who may have cause for impaired metabolism </plain></SENT>
