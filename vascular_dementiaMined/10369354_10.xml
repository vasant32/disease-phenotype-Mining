<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In subjects with subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (SIVD), tissue vacuolization, myelin <z:hpo ids='HP_0000980'>pallor</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> have been found on pathologic examination of white matter signal hyperintensities (WMSH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) values provide a potential measure of compromised white matter integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine if there were differences in MTR of WMSH between subjects with SIVD and cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen subjects with SIVD and 16 control subjects of comparable age and sex were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MTR images were coregistered to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images segmented into tissue classes (gray matter, white matter, CSF, WMSH, and lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MTR of WMSH was compared across groups and examined by WMSH location, size, and total burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: WMSH burden was greater in SIVD patients than in control subjects (2.4% vs 0.67%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MTR of WMSH did not differ between groups, but MTR of periventricular WMSH was lower in SIVD patients than in control subjects (37.6% vs 39.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Even after accounting for covariant effects of lesion burden, there was still a trend toward reduced periventricular WMSH MTR in the group with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between WMSH MTR and WMSH lesion size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings are consistent with observations that pathologic changes in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are most severe in the periventricular white matter and suggest that insight into the pathophysiology of SIVD might be gleaned from studies of the periventricular region </plain></SENT>
