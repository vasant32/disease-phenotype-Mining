<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Multi-centre trial of 410 outpatients with mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or mixed form) scoring between 9 and 23 on the SKT cognitive test battery, at least five on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and three or higher in at least one item of the NPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly allocated to double-blind treatment with 240 mg of EGb 761 or placebo once daily for 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary outcomes were the changes from baseline in the SKT total score and the NPI total score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC), Activities of Daily Living International Scale (ADL-IS), NPI distress score, DEMQOL-Proxy quality-of-life scale and Verbal Fluency Test were secondary outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At endpoint, patients treated with EGb 761 (n = 202) improved by -1.4 (95% confidence interval -1.8; -1.0) points on the SKT and by -3.2 (-4.0; -2.3) on the NPI total score, whereas those receiving placebo (n = 202) deteriorated by +0.3 (-0.1; 0.7) on the SKT and did not change on the NPI total score (-0.9; 0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both drug-placebo comparisons were significant at p &lt; 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EGb 761 was significantly superior to placebo with respect to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> secondary outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adverse event rates were similar for both treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EGb 761, 240 mg once-daily, was found significantly superior to placebo in the treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with neuropsychiatric symptoms </plain></SENT>
