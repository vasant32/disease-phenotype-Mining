<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To provide comparative evidence for a valid and practical measure of mental-status functioning that could be used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Five mental-status neuropsychological tools for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> screening were administered to patients in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025261" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory disorder</z:e> clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These included the Mini-Mental State Examination, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating Scale, the 6-item derivative of the Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test, a short Mental Status Questionnaire, and a composite tool we labeled the Ottawa Mental Status Examination, which assessed orientation, memory, attention, language, and visual-constructive functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The tools were compared using various criteria, including the statistical factors of sensitivity and reliability; effects of gender, native language, and language of testing; the utility of these tests for the differential diagnosis of Alzheimer-type and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; and sensitivity to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in the entire sample and among patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the tests were highly intercorrelated, suggesting that they are interchangeable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The comparisons along the various criteria indicate that if the objective is to have a general index of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer type, short tests are at least as good and sometimes better than the longer tests </plain></SENT>
