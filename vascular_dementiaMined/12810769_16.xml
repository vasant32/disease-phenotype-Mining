<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0549117" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">frontal lobe syndrome</z:e> (FLS) and the frontal variant of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (fvFTD) in a population based sample of 85 year olds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A representative sample of 85 year olds (n = 451) in Gothenburg, Sweden was examined with a neuropsychiatric examination and a key informant interview performed by an experienced psychiatrist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A subsample underwent computed tomography (CT) of the head </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Lund-Manchester research criteria were used as a basis for a symptom algorithm to identify individuals with FLS and fvFTD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These were diagnosed blindly to the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> according to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 86 individuals (19%) fulfilled the criteria for FLS, and 14 of them fulfilled criteria for fvFTD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among those with FLS, 75 (87%) fulfilled <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R criteria for other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, mainly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the 14 fvFTD cases, only five were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> according to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moderate to severe frontal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was found in 93% of those with FLS (and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with fvFTD), but also in 49% of those without FLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>FLS was found in 35% of those with moderate to severe frontal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, and in 3% of those without these changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of fvFTD was 3% in 85 year olds, which is higher than previously expected in this age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only a minority of those with fvFTD were detected by the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>FLS was even more common, especially in those diagnosed with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> disorder </plain></SENT>
