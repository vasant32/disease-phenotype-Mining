<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Numerous mutations in the 23 exons of the NOTCH3 gene have been reported to cause CADASIL in Caucasian populations, but the full spectrum of genetic changes leading to this disease is yet to be known and, especially, very few reports are available on CADASIL in Asian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We genotyped members of a 5-generational Han Chinese family with CADASIL patients and identified an R133C mutation in the NOTCH3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical analysis demonstrated that the penetrance of the mutation was not complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five of the mutation carriers, not exposed to the known vascular risk factors, did not show any clinical feature of CADASIL, suggesting the importance of environmental factors to the development of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Members of a 5-generational Han Chinese family with CADASIL patients had an R133C mutation in the NOTCH3 gene but only individuals exposed to known vascular risk factors developed CADASIL </plain></SENT>
