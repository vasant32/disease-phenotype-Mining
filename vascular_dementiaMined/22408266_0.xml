<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Double blind, randomised, parallel group, placebo controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Norwegian nursing homes; residents recruited by 16 study centres in Norway from August 2008 to June 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: 128 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and neuropsychiatric symptoms (but no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0868892,C0868894,C0011581,C0012706,C0868893" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">depressive disorder</z:e>), who had been prescribed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36791">escitalopram</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7936">paroxetine</z:chebi> for three months or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We excluded patients with severe somatic disease or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">terminal illness</z:e>, or who were unable to take tablets or capsules as prescribed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Antidepressant treatment was discontinued over one week in 63 patients, and continued in 68 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We assessed patients at baseline, four, seven, 13, and 25 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were score differences between study groups in the Cornell scale of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and the neuropsychiatric inventory (10 item version) after 25 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes were score differences in the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rating scale, unified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> rating scale, quality of life-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> scale, Lawton and Brody's physical self maintenance scale, and severe impairment battery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using a linear multilevel model analysis, we found that the discontinued group had significantly higher scores on the Cornell scale after 25 weeks than the continuation group (difference -2.89 (95% confidence interval -4.76 to -1.02); P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We saw a similar result in the mean total score for the neuropsychiatric inventory after 25 weeks, but this difference was non-significant (-5.96 (-12.35 to 0.44); P=0.068) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We confirmed these results by non-response analysis (&gt;30% worsening on the Cornell scale)--significantly more patients worsened in the discontinuation group than in the continuation group (32 (54%) v 17 (29%); P=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We found no significant differences between the groups for secondary outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Forty seven (37%) patients withdrew from the study early </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Discontinuation of antidepressant treatment in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and neuropsychiatric symptoms leads to an increase in depressive symptoms, compared with those patients who continue with treatment </plain></SENT>
