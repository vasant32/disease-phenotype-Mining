<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) rise with age and are increased in people with mutations that cause early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, Abeta(1-42) concentrations may decrease early in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We postulated that concentrations of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) in plasma are associated with risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We did a case-cohort study embedded in the prospective, population-based Rotterdam Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 6713 participants at risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, a random sample of 1756 people was drawn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During follow-up (mean 8.6 years), 392 incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association between plasma Abeta concentrations and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and its subtypes using Cox proportional hazard models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: High concentrations of Abeta(1-40) but not Abeta(1-42) at baseline were associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with the first quartile of Abeta(1-40), age and sex-adjusted hazard ratios for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> for the second, third, and fourth quartiles were 1.07 (95% CI 0.72-1.58), 1.16 (0.78-1.70), and 1.46 (1.01-2.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>People with an increased Abeta(1-42)/Abeta(1-40) ratio had a reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Compared with the first quartile of the Abeta(1-42)/Abeta(1-40) ratio, hazard ratios for the second, third, and fourth quartiles were 0.74 (0.53-1.02), 0.62 (0.44-0.88), and 0.47 (0.33-0.67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Associations were similar for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: High plasma concentrations of Abeta(1-40), especially when combined with low concentrations of Abeta(1-42), indicate an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A potential role of plasma Abeta concentrations as a marker of incipient <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> warrants further investigation </plain></SENT>
