<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A Day Care program designed for individuals with Senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer type (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e>) and Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> (VD:MID and BD), activates the brain through memory training, creative arts therapy, physical activity, and social interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is to determine if Day Care can modify the patients intellectual decline or even alter the natural course of the dementing illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>135 SDAT and 213 VD patients were studied over three years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ADL (Activities of Daily Living) measurements were evaluated by the Barthel Index and cognitive measurements by the NM-scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Wilcoxon test and the Sign test were carried out using the BI and NM-scale scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicated a decline or arrest in the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> and VD as determined by the multiple logistical models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 8 variables (risk factors, medication, age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, self-rehabilitation, family support, sex, grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and Day Care) influence on the survival curves was calculated using the Kaplan-Meire Life table method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Cox proportional hazard analysis was then used to examine the relationship between the 8 variables and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The significantly positive results from these four analyses of the ADL and cognitive measurements indicate that Day Care programs clearly retards the progression of intellectual decline in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients and improves the quality of life (QOL) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In VD patients the mortality rate was notably decreased through Day Care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results make one consider the benefits of introducing such programs into society as a strong treatment against the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> developing into severe, dehabilitating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However a healthy diet, a physically and mentally active life, as well as early diagnosis, are the best preventions against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
