<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prevalence estimates from community surveys indicate that, on average, 5% of persons over 65 and 15 to 20% of people over 80 suffer from "severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinico-pathological studies have shown that AD accounts for 50 to 60% of the cases and VD for about 10 to 20%; 20% of the patients have both disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate of VD ranges from 7 per 1,000 person-years in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers to 16 per 1,000 person-years in subjects with risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, particularly <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The only effective therapeutic approach to VD is the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, mainly through the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>; however, none of the therapeutic trials has included VD prevention as one of its treatment goals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Syst-Eur Study is a European placebo controlled trial which aims to determine whether morbidity and mortality are changed when elderly patients (60 years and over) with isolated systolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> are treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this trial, the incidence of VD will be carefully recorded during the five year follow-up of the expected 3,000 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="?"><plain>The present side project to the Syst-Eur trial will specifically address the following questions: does <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment reduce the incidence of VD?, and how do the cognitive functions of elderly patients change when treated with active or placebo treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The protocol is based on the administration of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> (Folstein) once a year to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> score is 23 or less, a set of criteria will be used to establish the diagnosis of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A pilot study has demonstrated the feasibility of the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The main study is in progress </plain></SENT>
