<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The CDT requires a patient to draw the face of a clock, insert <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the numbers and set the hands for a specified time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This task engages a number of cognitive abilities including verbal understanding, memory, spatially coded knowledge, planning, concentration and visuoconstructive skills </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although CDT has been regarded as a simple and useful screening tool in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, little is known about the longitudinal changes in CDT performance and error types, according to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtypes and their severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred thirty-five consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> = AD, n=94, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (PDD), n = 119, Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> = VaD, n = 22) were recruited from the memory clinic at Chungnam University hospital from January 2005 to July 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Korean version of the mini-mental state examination (MMSE-K) and CDT were performed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants every 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Scoring of the CDT performance was in accordance with the method of Mano and Wu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Error types of CDT were classified as follows: stimulus-bound response (SBR), conceptual deficit (CD), spatial and/or planning deficit (SPD) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233651" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">perseveration</z:e> error (PE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We divided patients into 3 groups by their initial MMSE-K score (severe, MMSE-K ≤ 17; moderate, 18 ≤ MMSE-K &lt; 24; mild, 24 ≤ MMSE-K) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparisons of CDT scores and error types in the three <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtypes and three cognitive groups were conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results: Longitudinal changes on CDT and MMSE-K scores were not different between the three <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From the analysis of CDT error type, the most common error type was SPD in patients with mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, CD error was the most frequent in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The order of error frequency in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects from baseline to the last follow-up was as follows: SPD, CD, SBR and PE except CD was the most frequent error type in AD patients after 18 months from baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Longitudinal analysis of error on CDT may reflect different characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e> according to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtypes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> stages </plain></SENT>
