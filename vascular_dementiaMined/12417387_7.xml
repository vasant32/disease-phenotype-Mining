<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (FTD)) and the rCBF in the SPECT examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with AD, the SPECT examination showed hypoperfusion in temporoparietal regions, contrary to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo>, where hypoperfusion was limited to the frontal area, and compared to patients with VaD, where "patchy" rCBF changes were observed in different regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In mild cases of AD, perfusion deficits were observed in the frontal regions equal to those in VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study shows that the SPECT examination may be useful in distinguishing between AD, VaD, and FTD; however, for proper diagnosis in the early stages of AD, additional factors must be taken into consideration </plain></SENT>
