<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present work, we examined different polygenic influences on the risk of PSD in a series of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 150 consecutive patients evaluated 3 months after suffering <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were evaluated with a prospective standard protocol and genotyped for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>-associated polymorphisms in the genes coding for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (including apoE coding and apoE promoter polymorphisms), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two cases (21.3%) resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> 3 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with PSD, the frequency of apoE epsilon 4 (0.08), ACE-D (0.64), ACT-A (0.62) alleles and apoE gene promoter polymorphisms (-491/A, 0.88; -427/C, 0.02) was similar to that of patients without PSD (apoE epsilon 4: 0.10, p=0.79; ACE-D: 0.56, p=0.36; ACT-A: 0.51, p=0.21; -491/A: 0.86, p=1.00; -427/C: 0.08, p=0.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that PSD is not associated with the genetic risk factors of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) that were studied, and that additional factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of PSD </plain></SENT>
