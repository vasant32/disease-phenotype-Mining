<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated relationships between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, high cholesterol, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>), events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>), and subsequent risk of AD and VaD by sex in a community-based cohort of 3264 Cache County residents aged 65 or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular history was ascertained by self-report or proxy-report in detailed interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AD and VaD were diagnosed using standard criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Estimates from discrete-time survival models showed no association between self-reported history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and high cholesterol and AD after adjustments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> increased the risk of VaD [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 2.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95-7.44] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> increased the risk of AD in females (aHR 2.23, 95% CI 1.09-4.30) but not males </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk of VaD after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was increased in females (aHR 16.90, 95% CI 5.58-49.03) and males (aHR 10.95, 95% CI 2.48-44.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that vascular factors increase risks for AD and VaD differentially by sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future studies should focus on specific causal pathways for each of these factors with regard to sex to determine if sex differences in the prevalence of vascular factors have an influence on sex differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
