<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The binding density (Bmax) in AD/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> was significantly reduced to 50% of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A reduction of Bmax in VD was also noted, but it did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No differences in apparent binding affinity (Kd) between controls and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> (<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>), dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT) and homovanillic acid were also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> and DOPAC were reduced by 30-40% in AD/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> and VD, but the reductions did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The concentration of 3-MT was reduced by 40% in AD/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> and by 30% in VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The [3H]GBR-12935-binding densities correlated significantly with corresponding concentrations of <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> in control brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the loss of [3H]GBR-12935-binding sites in human putamen in AD/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> reflects a degeneration of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> neurites </plain></SENT>
