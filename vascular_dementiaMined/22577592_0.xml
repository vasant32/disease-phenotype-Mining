<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Older age, family history, low levels of education, and É›4 allele of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (APOE) gene are recognized risk factors for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> in AD and related disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In AAs, the contributions of APOE gene to AD risk continue to engender a considerable debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to the established role of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) risk in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, it is now believed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk and its endophenotype may directly comediate AD phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Given the pleiotropic effects of APOE on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and AD risks, the higher rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risks in AAs than in Whites, it is likely that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risks contribute to the disproportionately higher rates of AD in AAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Though the advantageous effects of aerobic exercise on cognition is increasingly recognized, this evidence is hardly definitive, and data on AAs is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we will discuss the roles of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors in the development of AD and related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>, the susceptibility of these risk factors to physiologic adaptation, and fitness-related improvements in cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Its relevance to AD prevention in AAs is emphasized </plain></SENT>
