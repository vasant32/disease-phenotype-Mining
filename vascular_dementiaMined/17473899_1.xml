<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statins</z:chebi> act by inhibiting the enzyme <z:chebi fb="0" ids="11814">3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA</z:chebi> (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis, which catalyzes the reduction of HMG-CoA to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25351">mevalonic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of this enzyme has proven to be effective for lowering plasma total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels in humans and can therefore be useful to treat atherosclerotic and dyslipidemic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical benefits of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> appear to extend beyond their <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Besides reducing cholesterol biosynthesis, inhibition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25350">mevalonate</z:chebi> by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> also leads to a reduction in the synthesis of important intermediates, such as the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24913">isoprenoids</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24017">farnesyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">pyrophosphate</z:chebi> and geranylgeranyl <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">pyrophosphate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These intermediates are involved in the posttranslational prenylation of several proteins (e.g., Ras, Rho, Rac) that modulate a variety of cellular processes including cellular signaling, differentiation, and proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Given the central role of these isoprenylated proteins in endothelial function, atherosclerotic plaque stability, platelet activity, coagulation, oxidation, and inflammatory and immunologic responses, it could be anticipated that these compounds may exert multiple beneficial effects in a broad spectrum of disorders including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and related vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This article summarizes these cholesterol-lowering-independent effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>, termed "pleiotropic effects," and the underlying mechanisms, as well as the preclinical experimental approaches that would be useful to evaluate the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
