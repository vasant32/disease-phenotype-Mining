<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is to compare the Eurotest with other screening tests and to determine whether there are any differences between European (other than Spanish) and Spanish patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included patients who were referred because of complaints that were compatible with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and they were asked to carry out a protocol of tests that included the global deterioration scale (GDS), Folstein's MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination), the Clock Test (CT) and the Eurotest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological data were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sample used in the study included 45 patients, 21 males and 24 females, with a mean age of 69.76 years; 34 were born in Spain and 11 abroad </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diagnoses were 17 with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, 8 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 6 with age-associated impairment, 5 with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 5 with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychiatric disorder</z:e>, 1 with mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 1 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distribution according to the GDS was as follows: 10 with a GDS of 2, 18 with a GDS of 3, and 17 with a GDS of 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients with a GDS 2 completed the tests correctly, those with a GDS 3 scored below the cut-off point 5 for the Eurotest, 4 for the MMSE and 3 for CT, and in the GDS 4 they were 9, 7 and 6, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results did not vary between Spaniards and foreigners, the kappa index between MMSE and the Eurotest was 0.39 and the Pearson coefficient was 0.67 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Eurotest was slightly more useful in patients with a greater degree of impairment </plain></SENT>
