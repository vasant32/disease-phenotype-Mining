<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although the age-related white matter changes (ARWMC) scale has been advocated to be applicable to both MRI and CT for assessing the severity of WMC, its inter-rater reliability on CT is only fair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to operationalize the ARWMC scale and investigate the effect of this operationalization on the reliability and validity on MRI and CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Operational definitions of the ARWMC scale were derived from Erkinjuntti research criteria for subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and Scheltens scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using original and operationalized ARWMC scale, eight observers recorded the time for rating per MRI and per CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated the inter-rater and intrarater reliability as well as validity against volume using data from 97 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Inter-rater reliability of the operationalized scale on CT (0.874, 95% confidence interval [0.780-0.934]) was better than the original scale (0.569, 95% confidence interval [0.247-0.775]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Its intrarater reliability on CT (0.869) and reliability on MRI (inter-rater: 0.860; intrarater: 0.838) was comparable with the original scale (CT intrarater: 0.750 and on MRI inter-rater: 0.845; intrarater: 0.853) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The time required to administer the operationalized scale (4'2″ for MRI and 1'18″ for CT) was similar to that of the original scale (3'56″ for MRI and 1'16″ for CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The original scale and operationalized scale also significantly correlated with WMC volume (operationalized scale ρ = 0.613, P &lt; 0.001, original scale ρ = 0.638, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Operational definitions improve the inter-rater reliability of ARWMC scale on CT, and it correlates with volumetric measurement </plain></SENT>
