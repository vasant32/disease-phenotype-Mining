<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare associations of lean fish vs fatty fish (tuna or other fish) intake with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD), and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) and in relation to APOE epsilon4 status in the Cardiovascular Health Cognition Study (CHCS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fish intake was assessed by food frequency questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, AD, and VaD were determined through a series of cognitive tests, physician's assessment, and committee consensus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate hazard ratios of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, AD, and VaD with lean fried fish, fatty fish, or total fish intake, which were then stratified by the presence of APOE epsilon4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although consumption of lean fried fish had no protective effect, consumption of fatty fish more than twice per week was associated with a reduction in risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> by 28% (95% CI: 0.51 to 1.02), and AD by 41% (95% CI: 0.36 to 0.95) in comparison to those who ate fish less than once per month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stratification by APOE epsilon4 showed this effect to be selective to those without the epsilon4 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjustment by education and income attenuated the effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the Cardiovascular Health Cognition Study, consumption of fatty fish was associated with a reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> for those without the APOE epsilon4 allele </plain></SENT>
