<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is common but its determinants are still incompletely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the Sydney <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Study, we performed detailed neuropsychological and medical-psychiatric assessments on 169 patients aged 50-85 years, 3-6 months after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and 103 controls with a majority of both groups undergoing MRI brain scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> subjects were diagnosed as having vascular mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (VaMCI) or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) or no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> by consensus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic, functional, cerebrovascular risk factors and neuroimaging parameters were examined as determinants of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> using planned logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 21.3% of subjects were diagnosed with VaD, with one case in those aged 50-59 years, 24% in those aged 60-69 years and 23% in those 70-79 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no difference by sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of VaMCI was 36.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>VaD subjects had lower premorbid intellectual functioning and had 0.9 years less education than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The VaD and VaMCI groups did not differ from the no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> group on any specific cerebrovascular risk factor, however overall those with impairment had a greater number of risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They did not differ consistently on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> severity, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels and neuroimaging parameters (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>) except for an excess of white matter lesions on MRI and greater number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the VaD and VaMCI groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On a series of logistic regression analyses, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume and premorbid function were significant determinants of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and MCI are common, especially in older individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular risk factors are not independent risk factors for VaD, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume is a significant determinant of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Premorbid functioning is a determinant of post- <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> impairment </plain></SENT>
