<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> can increase the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AD is less common in aspirin users than non-users, and there are plausible biological mechanisms whereby aspirin might slow the progression of either vascular or Alzheimer-type pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the benefits of aspirin in patients with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 310 community-resident patients who had AD and who had no potential indication or definite contraindication for aspirin were randomly assigned to receive open-label aspirin (n=156; one 75-mg enteric-coated tablet per day, to continue indefinitely) or to avoid aspirin (n=154) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome measures were cognition (assessed with the mini-mental state examination [MMSE]) and functional ability (assessed with the Bristol activities of daily living scale [BADLS]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes were time to formal domiciliary or institutional care, progress of disability, behavioural symptoms, caregiver wellbeing, and care time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were assessed at 12-week intervals in the first year and once each year thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the primary outcome measures was by intention to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN96337233 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Patients had a median age of 75 years; 156 patients had mild AD, 154 had moderate AD, and 18 had concomitant vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Over the 3 years after randomisation, in patients who took aspirin, mean MMSE score was 0.10 points higher (95% CI -0.37 to 0.57; p=0.7) and mean BADLS score was 0.62 points lower (-1.37 to 0.13; p=0.11) than in patients assigned to aspirin avoidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no obvious differences between the groups in any other outcome measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>13 (8%) patients on aspirin and two (1%) patients in the control group had bleeds that led to admission to hospital (relative risk=4.4, 95% CI 1.5-12.8; p=0.007); three (2%) patients in the aspirin group had fatal cerebral bleeds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Although aspirin is commonly used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, in patients with typical AD 2 years of treatment with low-dose aspirin has no worthwhile benefit and increases the risk of serious bleeds </plain></SENT>
