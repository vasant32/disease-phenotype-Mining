<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Although a large body of evidence supports a role of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in the etiopathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, there is still a substantial lack of data regarding the biomarkers of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> characteristic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) as opposed to different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the level of various <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> parameters were measured in AD, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), and age- and sex-matched control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The AD and VaD patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had similar levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty AD, 19 VaD and 29 controls patients were recruited to the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>), total sulfhydryl (T-SH), calcium (Ca(++)) and <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> (Mg(++)) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both AD and VaD groups, the levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> parameters were higher compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, the VaD patients expressed significantly higher levels of plasma parameters of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> than AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference was noted in <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>, the marker of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, whereas in VaD the level of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> was more than 2.8-fold higher than that registered in AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in patients is characteristic of increased levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, especially <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding is relevant to determining the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, particularly in the light of the recently suggested importance of the vascular component in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> development, in addition to aiding in the diagnosis of VaD following clinical presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The study will be continued to compare the character and level of decline in both groups </plain></SENT>
