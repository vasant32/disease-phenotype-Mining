<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred fifty-two first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were recruited within 6-72 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood was drawn within 1 h after admission for determining biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cognitive function was assayed 2 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into four groups: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VCIND), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), and mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty healthy subjects were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that lower soluble receptor levels for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) and higher β-secretase enzyme (BACE1) and neprilysin (NEP) levels were found in the VCIND, VaD, and MD groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the percentages of ε3/ε4 genotypes and ε4 alleles in the VCIND, VaD, and MD groups were higher than in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Correlation analysis determined that sRAGE, BACE1, and NEP were significantly related to the results of neuropsychological assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis, however, suggested that only sRAGE and BACE1 changed ahead of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, only BACE1 and sRAGE, not NEP or APOE genotypes, may be biomarkers diagnosing post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
