<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A major neurosteroid <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> is allopregnanolone: the main source of circulating allopregnanolone is the adrenal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies indicated that a disturbance of the central regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis occurs in both senile (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>: AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the levels of circulating allopregnanolone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> and their response to corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) test in AD and VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three groups of 12 subjects were included in the study: AD, VD and age-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CRF test was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects and allopregnanolone, DHEA and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> levels were measured every 15min for 2h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean +/- s.e.m. allopregnanolone and DHEA basal levels were significantly lower in AD and VD than in controls, while <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> levels were significantly higher than in controls (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Allopregnanolone and DHEA levels increase in response to CRF test in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects but the area under curve (AUC) in patients was significantly lower than in controls (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">Cortisol</z:chebi> secretion appeared to be very sensitive in response to CRF stimulation: in fact, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> response to CRF test in AD and VD subjects was higher (both as AUC and as % max increase) than in controls (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study firstly showed that allopregnanolone levels are reduced both in AD and in VD and that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> has a preserved stimulated response of allopregnanolone to CRF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, however, the total response of allopregnanolone to CRF remains reduced in respect to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies are necessary for a better understanding of the role of neurosteroids in the regulation of cognitive function </plain></SENT>
