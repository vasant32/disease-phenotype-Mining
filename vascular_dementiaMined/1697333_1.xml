<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These were classified into three stages according to severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, Stage 1 (mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>)-Stage 3 (severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CSF levels of HVA decreased significantly in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, but the level of 5-HIAA did not correlate with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>beta-Ep levels did not differ significantly between any stages of DAT, and among controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>beta-Ep levels, however, in BD Stage 1 (27.5 +/- 5.9 pg/ml) were significantly higher (p less than 0.05), but level in Stage 3 (6.7 +/- 2.0) was significantly lower (p less than 0.001) than in the controls (19.2 +/- 4.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that CSF beta-Ep may depend on the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rather than severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and could possibly distinguish the closely resembling BD from true DAT </plain></SENT>
