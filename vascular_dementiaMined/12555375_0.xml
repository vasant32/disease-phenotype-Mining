<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the "Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo>" project of the European multicentre Syst-Eur trial was to study the influence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> therapy on the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in elderly patients with isolated systolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> included in this trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were over the age of 60, with systolic blood pressure between 160 and 219 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure less than 95 mmHg in the sitting position and were not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After randomization, they were treated under double-blind conditions with nitrendipine associated with or replaced by enalapril or hydrochlorothiazide or an equivalent placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cognitive functions were evaluated by the Mini-Mental State test (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi>) on inclusion then annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> score was &lt; or = 23, a complementary assessment was performed to establish the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> according to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> III-R criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Modified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischaemia</z:e> score specified the aetiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 1180 and 1238 subjects were randomized to the placebo and active treatment groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They presented comparable characteristics on inclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median intent to treat duration of follow-up was 2.0 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was decreased by 50%, from 7.7 per thousand patient-years in the placebo group to 3.8 per thousand patient-years in the active group (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were 15 and 8 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer type, 4 and 3 cases of mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 2 and 0 cases of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the placebo and active treatment groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in subjects over the age of 60 years with isolated systolic HT, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment initiated with nitrendipine can reduce the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
