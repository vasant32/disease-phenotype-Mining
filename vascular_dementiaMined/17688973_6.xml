<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> has been implicated in the early stage of this disease, its detailed pathogenesis and therapeutic targets remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis, particularly at the early stage, is important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the levels of potential biomarkers such as total hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (tHODE) and oxidatively modified peroxiredoxin (oxPrx)-2 and oxPrx-6 in plasma and/or erythrocytes were determined by a GC-MS apparatus and by two-dimensional electrophoresis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was found that these levels in AD patients were significantly higher than those in the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the tHODE levels increased with increasing clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> ratings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients could be distinguished by the correlation between plasma and erythrocyte tHODE levels or by that of tHODE with oxPrx in erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data further support that <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> is indeed involved in AD and that the correlative measures of tHODE and oxPrx are potential biomarkers for its diagnosis </plain></SENT>
