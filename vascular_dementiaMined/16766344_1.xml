<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The AD group performed significantly better than did the IVD group on lexical WLG, and a trend was observed indicating superior performance among the IVD group on categorical WLG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within-groups, comparisons of group means, and profile analyses of individual performance patterns <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> indicated that persons with AD demonstrated a lexical &gt; categorical pattern significantly more often than did IVD participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The absolute difference in average performance between the AD and IVD groups on lexical and categorical WLG was small; the findings, however, generally support the clinical utility of the lexical &gt; categorical WLG pattern in the differential diagnosis of AD and IVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patterns of performance support the presence of relative impairment in semantic processing among the individuals with AD and global deficits in retrieval and processing speed in individuals with IVD </plain></SENT>
