<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subjects included 93 with probable DAT, 65 with probable IVD, and 148 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The proportion of control subjects on ERT was almost 2:1, and this ratio holds for both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
