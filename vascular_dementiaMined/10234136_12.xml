<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Silent cerebrovascular damage such as lacunae and periventricular hyperintensity lesions is not infrequently detected in apparently healthy hypertensive elderly subjects by brain magnetic resonance imaging and also is more common among nondippers than it is among dippers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although no exact cause-effect relationship is known, a decrease in nocturnal fall of blood pressure might be secondary to a site-specific injury to the brain resulting in an impairment of central autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Besides <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695689" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nondipping</z:e>, evidence suggests that the extreme dipping (a marked nocturnal fall of blood pressure) should be considered a type of abnormal diurnal blood pressure variation in elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> who are likely to have advanced silent cerebrovascular damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pathogenic significance of 'extreme dipping' might be an 'artificial' excess reduction in blood pressure at night beyond the lower limit of blood pressure in the autoregulation of cerebral blood flow that is probably induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is also possible that a greater blood pressure variability in extreme dippers itself accelerates the hypertensive target-organ damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prospective follow-up of subjects with these distinct subtypes of abnormal circadian blood pressure variation as well as trials comparing a group of treated patients with various degrees of dipping with a group of untreated counterparts may establish the validity of assessing these distinct circadian rhythms of blood pressure as a useful clinical parameter in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
