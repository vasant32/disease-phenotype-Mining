<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cerebral WMLs are most likely caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> and can be experimentally induced by permanent bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies found the involvement of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and astrocytic activation in the cerebral WMLs of BCCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gypenoside (GP), a pure component extracted from the Gyrostemma pentaphyllum Makino, a widely reputed medicinal plants in China, has been reported to have some neuroprotective effects via anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and anti-inflammatory mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the protective effect of GP against cerebral WMLs and the underlying mechanisms for its inhibition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in BCCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally administered daily doses of 200 and 400mg/kg GP for 33 days after BCCAO, and spatial learning and memory were assessed using the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following behavioral testing, oxygen free radical levels and antioxidative capability were measured biochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The levels of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and oxidative DNA damage were also assessed by immunohistochemical staining for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32585">4-hydroxynonenal</z:chebi> and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Activated astrocytes were also assessed by immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting with GFAP antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The morphological changes were stained with Kl√ºver-Barrera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rats receiving 400mg/kg GP per day performed significantly better in tests for spatial learning and memory than saline-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>GP 400mg/kg per day were found to markedly scavenge oxygen free radicals, enhance <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> abilities, decrease <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxide</z:chebi> production and oxidative DNA damage, and inhibit the astrocytic activation in corpus callosum and optic tract in BCCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, GP 200mg/kg per day had no significant effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>GP may have therapeutic potential for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> and further evaluation is warranted </plain></SENT>
