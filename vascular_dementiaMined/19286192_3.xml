<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three hundred ninety-five patients aged 50 years or above, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with neuropsychiatric features were treated with EGb 761 (240 mg/day) or placebo for 22 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients scored between 9 and 23 on the Short Syndrome Test (SKT), a cross-culturally validated cognitive test battery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their total score on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was at least 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Efficacy was assessed by the SKT test battery (primary outcome measure), the Verbal Fluency Test, the Clock-Drawing Test, the NPI, the Hamilton Rating Scale for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> (HAMD), and the Gottfries-Br√•ne-Steen Scale (GBS) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Under EGb 761 treatment the SKT total score improved by -3.0+/-2.3 and -3.4+/-2.3 points in patients with AD and VaD, respectively, whereas the patients on placebo deteriorated by +1.2+/-2.5 and +1.5+/-2.2 points, respectively (p&lt;0.01 for both drug-placebo differences) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant drug-placebo differences were found for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> secondary outcome variables with no major differences between AD and VaD subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rate of adverse events tended to be higher for the placebo group </plain></SENT>
