<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three subject groups were studied: 17 patients with BD and periventricular hyperintensities (PVH) on MRI, 10 patients with ischemic cerebrovascular events and with PVH but no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 14 age-matched control subjects without PVH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability was quantified by calculation of T(1) change defined as [(T(1post) - T(1pre))/T(1pre)] x100, where T(1pre) and T(1post) represent the T(1) relaxation times before and after Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T(1) change in PVH of BD patients significantly decreased in comparison with that observed in PVH of the nondemented patients and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> white matter of the control subjects, but no significant T(1) change was observed between the PVH of the nondemented patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> white matter of the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between the Mini-Mental State Examination score and T(1) change for areas of PVH in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability increases in areas of PVH in BD and that a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> dysfunction is related to a progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
