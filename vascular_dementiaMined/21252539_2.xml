<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Remarkable improvement in the life expectancy of the Indian population is expected to commensurate with the increase in number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) are common and widely studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (ApoE) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)-174 G/C gene polymorphism along with serum IL-6 levels in AD and VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The polymorphisms in ApoE and IL-6-174 G/C genes were assessed using RFLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum IL-6 level was measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The allele ε4 of the ApoE gene was found to be associated with AD and VaD patients (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No association of IL-6-174 G/C polymorphism was observed in AD patients, while the IL-6-174 C allele increased the odds of having VaD twofold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis to assess possible interaction between ApoE and the IL-6-174 G/C genes revealed that presence of both the ε4 and C alleles increased the odds of having AD 13.75-fold and VaD 14.7-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum IL-6 levels did not correlate with either presence or severity of disease among AD or VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The ApoE ε4 allele is an important genetic marker for AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Presence of both ApoE ε4 and IL-6 C genes increases the OR of having AD and VaD markedly </plain></SENT>
