<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medications on cognitive function has not been well studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors' objectives were to investigate the cross-sectional and longitudinal association between the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medications and cognitive function and to compare different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medication classes with regard to this association in an elderly population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical records of a convenience sample of patients (n = 993 cross-sectional and 350 longitudinal; mean age, 76.8 +/- 0.3 years; 74% women; 87% White) followed at a geriatric practice were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data abstracted included demographics, medical history (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> [AD] or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> [VaD]), use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medications, and results of cognitive assessments (the Mini-Mental Status Examination [MMSE] and the Clock Draw Test [CDT]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the cross-sectional analysis, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> use was not associated with MMSE (p &gt;.05), CDT (p &gt;.05), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnosis (odds ratio for AD, 0.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6 to 1.2; odds ratio for VaD, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.6 to 4.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the longitudinal analysis, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> use was associated with a lower rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> on the MMSE (-0.8 +/- 2 points in users vs -5.8 +/- 2.5 points in nonusers; p =.007) and on the CDT (-0.3 +/- 0.8 points in users vs -2.2 +/- 0.8 points in nonusers; p =.002), and with a lower risk for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (odds ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.83; p =.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The trend was similar in patients with baseline AD (p =.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients taking <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> (p =.007), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors</z:chebi> (p =.016), and beta-blockers (p =.014) had a lower rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>, and patients taking angiotensin receptor blockers (p =.016) had improved cognitive scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">Antihypertensive</z:chebi> use, particularly <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzymes inhibitors</z:chebi>, beta-blockers, and angiotensin receptor blockers, may be associated with a lower rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in older adults, including those with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Until a randomized clinical trial confirms our results, findings of this observational study should be interpreted with caution </plain></SENT>
