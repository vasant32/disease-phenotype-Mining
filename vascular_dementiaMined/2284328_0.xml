<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When classified according to Hachinski's score, 24 patients were found to be suffering from senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer's type (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e>), whereas 27 patients presented with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MID) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During wash-out and the treatment period the somatic and social symptoms of the disease were assessed by the AGP score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral performance was evaluated by a battery of tests measuring memory, concentration, psychomotor coordination and degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electrical activity of the brain was estimated by a power-spectral analysis of EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the total study group, the naftidrofuryl group showed a significantly better improvement in the results of the psychometric test battery, which was the primary variable during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A parallel development was to be found in the AGP score and electrical brain function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When results of subgroups were analyzed according to the etiopathogenetic background of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e>, it was possible to show that naftidrofuryl affected psychopathometry and EEG-parameters while patients with MID responded to naftidrofuryl with changes in AGP score and EEG variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate the importance of etiopathologic features in performing studies with nootropic drugs in obtaining information on possible different actions in patients with different kinds of senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
