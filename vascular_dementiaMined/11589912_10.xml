<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The group consisted of 25 demented patients with frontosubcortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1446648" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain syndromes</z:e>, white-matter changes on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> or pronounced vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CSF-NFL was increased, whereas CSF-tau was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, suggesting a differential involvement of the cytoskeleton in this patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The albumin ratio and the apolipoproteinE4 (ApoE4) allele status were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The albumin ratio was increased, indicating damage to the vessel walls with breakdown of the blood-brain barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No relationship was found between ApoE4 alleles and CSF levels of tau or NFL in this patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Besides presenting original data, the disease status of SWD is also discussed </plain></SENT>
