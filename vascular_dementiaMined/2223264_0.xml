<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors present a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> (CAA) which caused multiple recurrent subcortical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CT scan revealed bilateral hypodensity of the hemispheric white matter in addition to multiple subcortical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The difference between white and gray matter densities was 14 approximately 15 HU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T2-weighted MRI showed the hemispheric white matter as high intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings on CT and MRI are compatible with those observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A biopsy of the cortex was performed and histological examination revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath> in the arterial wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath>, obliterative intimal proliferation and hyaline degeneration of the vessel were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is thought that the occlusive vascular change due to CAA may induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hypoperfusion of the hemispheric white matter and consequently the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> may develop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the aged population, CAA is noteworthy as a cause of both hemorrhagic and ischemic lesions, because the incidence of CAA is increasing with age </plain></SENT>
