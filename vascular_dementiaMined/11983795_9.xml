<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty patients meeting the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV criteria for either AD, VaD, or MD (20 per group) underwent assessment with the PST, a three-item screening measure of odor identification, and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with AD scored significantly lower than patients with either VaD or MD on the PST, even after controlling for MMSE scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A PST score of &gt; or =1 (i.e., 1 or 0 correct) discriminated between patients with and without AD with a classification accuracy of 95% (sensitivity 100%, specificity 92.5%) </plain></SENT>
