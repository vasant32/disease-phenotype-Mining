<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We estimated the bidirectional temporal relationship between depressive symptoms and cognitive function in older subjects, excluding subjects with a clinical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a total of 2,963 individuals from the Italian Longitudinal Study on Aging, depressive symptoms, global cognitive function, and episodic memory were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and MCI were classified using current clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Depressive symptoms at baseline were associated with an accelerated global cognitive function decline and an accelerated rate of episodic memory delayed recall decline in a 3.5-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, an accelerated increase with time of depressive symptoms during the same follow-up period was not associated with global cognitive function and episodic memory (immediate and delayed recall) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In older subjects non-cognitively impaired, depressive symptoms at baseline predicted change over time of global <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and episodic memory delayed recall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Global cognitive function and episodic memory at baseline were not associated with the course of depressive symptoms during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
