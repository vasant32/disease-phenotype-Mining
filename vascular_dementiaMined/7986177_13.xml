<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of dementing illnesses on the risk of dying, taking into account other conditions that would shorten survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Five-year follow-up of community survey of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Five-year data were obtained for the 3531 subjects, aged 65 years and older, who participated in the 1987 population survey of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in Shanghai, China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Time to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relative risks of dying were calculated for demographic variables, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnoses based on findings of clinical evaluations, and 15 reported prevalent medical conditions using the proportional hazards model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In those subjects aged 65 to 74 years, the mortality risk ratio was 5.4 (95% confidence interval, 2.0 to 14.6) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and 7.2 (95% confidence interval, 3.6 to 14.4) for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk ratio for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> was similar to the mortality risk ratio for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (5.6 [range, 2.9 to 10.9]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this age group, dementing illnesses were uncommon, and few <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were therefore attributable to the dementing illnesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In those subjects aged 75 years and older, the mortality risk ratios were 2.8 (95% confidence interval, 2.1 to 3.6) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 3.5 (95% confidence interval, 2.4 to 5.1) for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 3.6 (95% confidence interval, 2.0 to 6.7) for "other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>." Because these dementing disorders were common in those subjects aged 75 years and older, 23.7% of the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> could be attributed to these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> are truly malignant and constitute major risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in persons older than 75 years </plain></SENT>
