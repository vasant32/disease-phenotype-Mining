<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate patterns of local and systemic cytokine release in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intrathecal levels of cytokines were related to neuronal damage and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients with early AD and 26 patients with VAD were analyzed with respect to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, CSF levels of Fas/<z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-1 and bcl-2, a measure for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and Tau protein, a marker for neuronal degradation, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significantly increased CSF levels of GM-CSF but not of other cytokines were observed in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These patients displayed a significant correlation between the GM-CSF levels and the levels of Fas/<z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-1 and Tau protein in CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrates an intrathecal production of GM-CSF, a cytokine stimulating microglial cell growth and exerting inflammatogenic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that GM-CSF once secreted induces programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the brain tissue of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
