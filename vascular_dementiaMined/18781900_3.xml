<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: By using surface enhanced laser desorption/ionisation- time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) an amyloid beta (Abeta) profile was shown in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the Abeta-profile in serum with SELDI-TOF MS, to evaluate if this profile resembles CSF profiles and to investigate the correlation between intensity of Abeta-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-peaks in serum and clinical, demographical and genetic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Duplicate profiling of Abeta by an SELDI-TOF MS immunocapture assay was performed in 106 patients, suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> or Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> and age-matched non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analyses were performed to investigate the intensities of four selected Abeta peaks as dependent variables in relation to the independent clinical, demographic or genetic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Abeta37, Abeta38 and Abeta40 were found among additional unidentified Abeta <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, with the most pronounced Abeta peak at a molecular mass of 7752 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This profile partly resembled the CSF profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical diagnosis was not a predictive independent variable, however ABCB1 genotypes C1236T, G2677T/A, age and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> level showed to be related to Abeta peak intensities in multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found an Abeta profile in serum that partly resembled the CSF profile in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels, presence of the APOE epsilon4 allele and ABCB1 genotypes (C1236T and G2677T/A) were correlated with the Abeta serum profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The role of P-gp as an Abeta transporter and the role of ABCB1 genotypes deserves further research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The investigated serum Abeta profile is probably not useful in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
