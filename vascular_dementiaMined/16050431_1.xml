<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of cross-cultural studies of behavioral and psychological symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (BPSD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: BPSD were examined in consecutive series of referrals to a psychogeriatric service in Korea and the U.K. using the Behavioral Pathology in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> (BEHAVE-AD) rating scale and the Cornell Scale for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> (CSDD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results were analyzed separately for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Koreans in both diagnostic groups had lower Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) scores and higher BEHAVE-AD total and subscale scores for most subscales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both countries, for both diagnostic groups, the total BEHAVE-AD score and several subscale scores were negatively correlated with the MMSE scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> revealed that BEHAVE-AD total and most subscale scores independently predicted the country of origin in addition to the MMSE scores predicting the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These differences in BPSD are most likely explained by the lower MMSE scores in the Korean sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, genuine differences in BPSD between the two countries can only be critically examined in a cross-cultural population-based epidemiological study for both diagnostic categories using validated instruments to measure BPSD and controlling for the influence of MMSE score </plain></SENT>
