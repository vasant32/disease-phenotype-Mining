<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Increased levels of inflammatory proteins have been found in the brains and plasma samples of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether the levels of inflammatory proteins in plasma samples are elevated before clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether high levels of inflammatory proteins in plasma samples are associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: A case-cohort study within the Rotterdam Study, a population-based prospective cohort study in the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: The source population comprises 6713 subjects who, at baseline (1990-1993), were free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and underwent venipuncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From these, we selected both a random subcohort of 727 subjects and 188 cases who had developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The associations between plasma levels of alpha1-antichymotrypsin, C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, the soluble forms of intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1, and vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were examined using the Cox proportional hazards regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High levels of alpha1-antichymotrypsin, interleukin 6, and, to a lesser extent, C-reactive protein were associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; rate ratios per standard deviation increase were 1.49 (95% confidence interval, 1.23-1.81), 1.28 (95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.55), and 1.12 (95% confidence interval, 0.99-1.25), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar associations were observed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, whereas rate ratios of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were higher for alpha1-antichymotrypsin and C-reactive protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Soluble forms of intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 and vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 were not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Plasma levels of inflammatory proteins are increased before clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
