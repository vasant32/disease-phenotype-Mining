<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>At least seven different sets of criteria are commonly used for the diagnosis of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These are the ischemic scales (IS) of Hachinski, Rosen and Loeb, the criteria from the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R, those outlined by Erkinjuntti et al., the State of California <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Diagnostic and Treatment Centers (ADDTC) and the international workgroup of the American National Institute of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> (NINDS) and the European "Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the differences and similarities of these criteria, we applied them to a sample of 124 demented patients from the Maastricht Memory Clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only 8 patients were diagnosed as having VaD by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Depending on which criteria were used, the frequencies of VaD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) ranged from 6 to 32%, and from 48 to 56%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IS of Hachinski and Rosen resulted in the highest frequencies of VaD, whereas the criteria of Erkinjuntti and those from the ADDTC and the NINDS workgroup yielded the lowest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of patients with VaD was reduced substantially when neuroradiological data and the temporal relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were taken into consideration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the seven sets of criteria cannot be regarded as interchangeable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Differences in the criteria for VaD and AD may be an overlooked source of interstudy variance </plain></SENT>
