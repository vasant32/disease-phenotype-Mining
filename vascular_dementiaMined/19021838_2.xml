<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Most studies on mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) have been focused on amnestic MCI (aMCI) that is the preclinical stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only a few studies have involved patients in the preclinical stages of subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (subcortical vascular MCI, svMCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tried to compare the overall <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in patients with svMCI with that of patients with aMCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared the regional metabolic patterns shown on 18 F-FDG (fluro deoxy <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) images from 18 patients with svMCI with those from 25 aMCI patients matched for age, sex, education, and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score and with those from 35 healthy subjects using a voxel-wise analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SPM 2 was used for statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Relative to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, the hypometabolic regions in the aMCI patients were in the bilateral parahippocampal, bilateral posterior cingulate, left superior temporal gyri, left inferior parietal lobule, and right inferior frontal gyrus while those in the svMCI patients were located in the thalamus, insula, superior temporal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, cingulum, right basal ganglia, cerebellum, and brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A direct comparison of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism between svMCI and aMCI showed that the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> hypometabolism in patients with svMCI was more severe in the thalamus, brainstem, and cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that svMCI was distinct from aMCI in terms of neuropsychological and PET findings, which may explain their clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
