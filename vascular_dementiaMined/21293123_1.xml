<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent findings suggest that white matter lesions (WML) may be associated with hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of the study was to examine hippocampal and WML volumes in MCI patients and to examine if WML were linked to hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Gothenburg MCI study is a clinically based longitudinal study with biennial clinical assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The participants (n = 166) consist of 92 patients with stable MCI, 30 patients with converting MCI, and 44 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>WML volumes was measured manually using MRIcron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Automated segmentation of hippocampal and total white matter volumes was performed using FreeSurfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients converting from MCI to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> had reduced hippocampal volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stable MCI patients had fewer WML and converting MCI patients had more WML compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal volume was only correlated to WML volume (œÅ = 0.57; p &lt; 0.01) in the quartile (n = 42) with the most WML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> is present in both AD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal volume was associated with WML volume only in the high WML quartile, suggesting that the WML volume must reach a threshold before hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> is seen </plain></SENT>
