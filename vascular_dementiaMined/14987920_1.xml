<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>C3 exhibits a molecular weight of 2200-2500 Da with a narrow distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to assess the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of C3 in non-human primates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>C3 was administered as an intravenous or subcutaneous bolus dose of 1.0 or 2.5 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-factor Xa activity, Heptest clotting time and activated partial thromboplastin time were measured to determine pharmacodynamic effects of C3 in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pharmacokinetics of C3 was primarily characterized by measuring plasma anti-factor Xa activity as a surrogate marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of absorption and elimination of C3 after administration did not change with increasing dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The volume of distribution of C3 was small, reflecting a major distribution inside the intravascular space (110-130 ml/kg), and was independent of dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The total clearance (16.0-21.0 ml/h/kg) and half-life (4-6 h) of C3 were also dose-independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Within the observed dose range, a 2.5 times of the C3 dose resulted in an area under the plasma concentration-time curve that was approximately 16-27% greater than expected on the basis of linear disposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These differences could be attributed to the endogenous release of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) by C3 at higher doses, which is associated with the vascular effects of C3 </plain></SENT>
