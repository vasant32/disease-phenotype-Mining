<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Nondemented patients from a memory clinic cohort (n = 118), and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cohort (n = 80, older than 55 years and with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 'Multiple domain MCI' had the highest sensitivity for both AD (80.8%) and VaD (100%), and 'amnestic MCI' had the highest specificity (85.9% for AD, 100% for VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value was low for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subtypes (0.0-32.7%), whereas the negative predictive value was high (72.8-100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The subtype 'multiple domain MCI' has high sensitivity in identifying people at risk for developing AD or VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The predictive accuracy of the MCI subtypes was similar for both AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
