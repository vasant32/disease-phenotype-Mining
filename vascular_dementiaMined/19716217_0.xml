<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous reports suggest that some of the risk factors may be common to both vascular as well as degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among genetic factors, role of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and <z:chebi fb="13" ids="29357,29358">methylene</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="20506,26907">tetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) genes as putative risk factors has been examined but the outcome of these studies remain inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Present study attempted to see the importance of ACE alu insertion/deletion and MTHFR C677T polymorphisms as genetic predisposers to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study comprised of 80 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients, 90 degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients and 170 age matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were genotyped for ACE, MTHFR and APOE polymorphisms using PCR-RFLP method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Frequency of ACE D allele was seemingly high in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases (26.7%) when compared to controls (11.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, after adjusting for age and APOE E4*, none of the ACE alleles showed good correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MTHFR genotypes or alleles also did not show any correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests no true correlation of ACE or MTHR genes with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in elderly </plain></SENT>
