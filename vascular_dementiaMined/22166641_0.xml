<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two-vessel occlusion of common carotid arteries (2VO) is the most popular model for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to investigate the possibility of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="12936">D-gal</z:chebi> injection plus 2VO simulating <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> of aging vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; and whether transplanted bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) can improve the cognitive function induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="12936">D-gal</z:chebi> injection plus 2VO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Totally 30 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 5 groups equivalently: control group, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="12936">D-gal</z:chebi> group, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="12936">D-gal</z:chebi> + 2VO group, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="12936">D-gal</z:chebi> + 2VO + saline water group, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="12936">D-gal</z:chebi> + 2VO + BMSCs group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aging hypoperfusion rats were created by subcutaneous injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="12936">D-gal</z:chebi> and occlusion of two common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BMSCs or saline water was stereotactically transplanted into the subventricular zone as treatment vehicles at 24 hours post operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two-way repeat analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for significance analysis of 5 groups at 6 weeks post transplantation; moreover, Tamhane's test (equal variance not assumed) and least significant difference (<z:chebi fb="162" ids="6605">LSD</z:chebi>) test (equal variance assumed) were used for pairwise comparison in <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> (MWM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Transplanted BMSCs distributed around the lateral ventricles and acquired the phenotypes of neurons and astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In terms of swimming path distance and escape latency in MWM, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="12936">D-gal</z:chebi> + 2VO + BMSC group showed significant improvement than the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="12936">D-gal</z:chebi> + 2VO group but was still obviously worse than the control group (both P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in swimming speed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="12936">D-gal</z:chebi> plus 2VO induces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The engrafted BMSCs exhibit the beneficial effect on cognitive function via promotion interactively with host brain </plain></SENT>
