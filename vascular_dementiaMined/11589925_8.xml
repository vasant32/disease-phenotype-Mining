<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The influence of anti-hypertensive treatment on hypertensive brain damage was assessed in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SHR and age-matched normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were treated from the 14-26th week of age with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50075">dihydropyridine</z:chebi>-type <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channel blockers lercanidipine, manidipine and nimodipine and as a reference with the non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50075">dihydropyridine</z:chebi>-type <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> hydralazine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Volume of brain areas, number of nerve cells and glial fibrillary-acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactive astrocytes and neurofilament 200 kDa immunoreactivity were investigated in frontal and occipital cortex and in hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In control SHR, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was significantly higher in comparison with WKY rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compounds tested decreased to a similar extent SBP values in SHR, with the exception of nimodipine that caused a smaller reduction of SBP compared with other compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Decreased volume and number of nerve cells and loss of neurofilament protein immunoreactivity were observed in SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes increased in number (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>) and in size (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>) in the frontal and occipital cortex of control SHR, and only in number in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anti-hypertensive treatment countered in part microanatomical changes occurring in SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Drugs investigated with the exception of nimodipine exerted an equi-hypotensive effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In spite of this the best protection was exerted by lercanidipine and, to a lesser extent, by nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Compared with nimodipine, lercanidipine induced a more effective decrease of SBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This may represent an advantage in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> with risk of brain damage </plain></SENT>
