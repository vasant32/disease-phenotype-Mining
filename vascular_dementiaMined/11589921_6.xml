<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirteen published clinical trials, examining in total 4054 patients, have evaluated the use of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> alphoscerate in various forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> disorders of degenerative, vascular or combined origin, such as senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer's type (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e>) or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebrovascular diseases, such as transitory ischemic attack (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis has assessed the design of each study, in particular with respect to experimental design, number of cases, duration of treatment and tests used to evaluate drug clinical efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of the ten studies performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> disorders were controlled trials versus a reference drug or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, 1570 patients were assessed in these studies, 854 of which in controlled trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As detected by validated and appropriate tests, such as Mini Mental State Evaluation (MMSE) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> and Sandoz Clinical Assessment Geriatric (SCAG) in VaD, administration of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> alphoscerate significantly improved patient clinical condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical results obtained with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> alphoscerate were superior or equivalent to those observed in control groups under active treatment and superior to the results observed in placebo groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis stresses the clear internal consistency of clinical data gathered by different experimental situations on the drug effect, especially with regard to the cognitive symptoms (memory, attention) characterising the clinical picture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic usefulness of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> alphoscerate in relieving cognitive symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cerebral deterioration differentiates this drug from cholinergic precursors used in the past, such as <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> and lecithin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three uncontrolled trials were performed with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> alphoscerate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebrovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, totalling 2484 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of these trials suggest that this drug might favour functional recovery of patients with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and should be confirmed in future investigations aimed at establish the efficacy of the drug in achieving functional recovery of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
