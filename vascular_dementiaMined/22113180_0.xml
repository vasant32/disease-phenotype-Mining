<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have determined various biomarkers in the peripheral blood of Alzheimer, Parkinson and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients by comparing the samples with those of first-degree relatives and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our results, together with correlation studies using data from the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), suggest that the clinical evaluation of the <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> (NOx) concentration in Alzheimer patients should be complemented by assays of protein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyls</z:chebi> (PCs) levels, the ratio of reduced to oxidized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH/GSSG) in plasma, PCs in erythrocytes and PCs and calcium content in leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For Parkinson patients it would be useful to determine NOx, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric-acid</z:chebi> reactive substances (TBARS) and PCs in erythrocytes, and NOx and TBARS en leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For vascular-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> (VD) patients, determination of NOx, Cu, and GSH/GSSG in plasma and TBARS, and PCs in erythrocytes together with PCs in leukocytes should be assayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relatives of Alzheimer patients showed alterations in plasma Se and Zn concentrations, catalase (CAT) activity in erythrocytes and calcium content in leukocytes as possible predictive markers of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relatives of Parkinson patients showed elevated levels of NOx in leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the case of vascular-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients we suggest NOx, GSH/GSSG and Î±-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="27013">tocopherol</z:chebi> in plasma, the CAT/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase ratio in erythrocytes and TBARS, GSSG and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> reductase in leukocytes as predictive markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Large-scale longitudinal population-based studies using these suggested biomarkers are necessary in order to assess their level of reliability and specificity in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
