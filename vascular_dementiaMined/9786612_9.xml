<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-four Caucasian VD cases and 79 healthy control probands were involved in this study according to the criteria of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10 and NINDS-AIREN International Workshop Diagnostic Criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood and the apoE alleles were determined by polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The E2, E3 and E4 allele frequencies in the VD group were 5%, 76%, and 19%, respectively; and significant (P&lt;0.03) differences were found in comparison with the data on the healthy controls (E2, 6%; E3, 87%; E4, 8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The apoE4 allele frequency was intermediate between HC and Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> group (28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the apoE4 allele could be a risk factor not only for certain primary degenerative, but also for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
