<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the retina and brain share embryological, anatomical and physiological similarities, studies of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> blood vessels may prove to be useful as a surrogate marker for cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In epidemiological studies abnormal <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arteriovenous ratios (AVRs) predict the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the association between <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vasoreactivity, cerebral small vessel ischemic disease, and cerebral blood vessel function remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STUDY GOALS: To examine (1) the association between cerebral ischemic white matter disease (WMD) and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> microvessel behavior and (2) the relationship between <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> blood vessel reactivity and measures of cerebrovascular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cohort study of 12 patients with ischemic WMD and 14 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> vasoreactivity was measured following high frequency flicker light stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) vasoreactivity was measured using transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging scans (MRIs) were reviewed for evidence of ischemic WMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with ischemic WMD had attenuated <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> venous (2.2% ± 0.27 SD, vs. controls 6% ± 0.7 SD, p=0.002, CI 95%) and arterial (1.9% ± 0.8 SD, vs. controls 4.9% ± 0.8 SD, p=0.004, CI 95%) vasoreactivity compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An attenuated <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> venous light flicker response was associated with a significant decrease of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> vasoreactivity (r=0.45, p=0.05, CI 95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Decreased AVRs, an indicator for altered <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vessel architecture in patients with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ischemic WMD, were also significantly correlated with dysfunction of cerebral vasoreactivity (r=0.69, p=0.001, CI 95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study functional and structural impairment of the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> microvasculature were associated with ischemic WMD and measures of cerebral vascular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Microvascular dysfunction in the eye may predict cerebral small vessel disease, but validation by larger studies is needed </plain></SENT>
