<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the influence of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (ApoE) epsilon4 allele on the rate of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in patients with clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and in subjects at risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighty-one subjects, consecutively referred to a memory clinic due to symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, went through a comprehensive examination, including cerebral magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After an initial investigation these subjects were divided into one of six diagnostic groups; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD, n = 23), objective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (OCI, n = 27), subjective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (SCI, n = 17), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (FTD) and unspecified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (USD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The last three groups were joined into one diagnostic group designated 'other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>' (OD, altogether n = 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to study the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> as well as the rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in different brain regions <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects were reinvestigated after an average period of 16 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interest was focused on investigating if those subjects with one or two epsilon4 alleles differed in either <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> progression or rate of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> compared to those without the epsilon4 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that the ApoE epsilon4 carriers had a statistically significantly larger increase in ventricular volume as compared with the ApoE epsilon4 noncarriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diagnostic groups the ApoE epsilon4 carriers showed a greater rate of ventricular volume increase, as compared to the noncarriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, this difference was statistically significant only for the OD subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No statistical significant changes over time were seen for whole brain volume or volume of the temporal lobes and the medial temporal lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic groups differed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> progression with the AD subjects having the most pronounced reduction in MMSE scores as compared to subjects at risk for AD (OCI and SCI subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The presence of ApoE epsilon4 allele did not influence the change in MMSE in any of the diagnostic groups </plain></SENT>
