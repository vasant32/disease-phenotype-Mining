<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Apo E polymorphism has been related to significant modifications of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> profile, as well as to the incidence of different pathologies including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it was proposed that apo E polymorphism might be involved in the aging selection process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purposes of the present study were the following: (1) to evaluate apo E polymorphism in 'successful' and 'unsuccessful' aging, defined as the absence or presence of disability and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases (mainly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>), respectively; (2) to evaluate the impact of apo E polymorphism on plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in very old individuals free of or affected by disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 253 Italian subjects including 100 free-living healthy octo- and nonagenarians, 62 disabled octo- and nonagenarians, and 91 healthy adult controls, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> matched for origin were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Apo E phenotypes were determined by PhastSystem (Pharmacia) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">Lipoprotein</z:chebi> parameters (total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (a), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13850">apoprotein</z:chebi> A-I and B) were measured by standardized methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ADL were evaluated by the Katz index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of sigma2, sigma3, and sigma4 alleles was 0.062, 0.887, and 0.051 respectively in the entire sample; no differences in alleles distribution were found between the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When the subjects were divided according to the E type (E2 type: E2/E2 and E2/E3; E3 type: E3/E3; E4 type: E3/E4 and E4/E4), no differences in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> parameters emerged, but a trend toward higher total and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> from the E2 to the E4 type was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The sigma4 allele had a raising effect, while sigma2 had a lowering effect on total cholesterol levels, but these effects were much less profound in the disabled octo- and nonagenarians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that (1) the frequency of the sigma4 allele is very low in this sample of subjects from central Italy; (2) no differences emerged in sigma4 distribution between healthy and disabled octo- and nonagenarians, and adult controls; the very low frequency of sigma4 allele might contribute to this finding; (3) our data do not support the hypothesis of a possible association between apo E polymorphism and longevity or disability in this population </plain></SENT>
