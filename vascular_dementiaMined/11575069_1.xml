<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We replicated Bourgeois' intervention with five people with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (Mini-Mental State Examination scores 0-4) and diagnoses of Alzheimer-type or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and evaluated the impact of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> on the proportion of time participants spent on topic in conversation with carers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For three participants, use of the memory aid did not increase the proportion of time-spent on-topic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remaining two participants, however, spent approximately twice as much time on-topic when using the aid as when conversing without it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results extend Bourgeois' work by showing that memory <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> are helpful to some people with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
