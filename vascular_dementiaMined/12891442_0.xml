<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To know its prevalence and characterization, we reviewed 549 consecutive autopsied brains in our Department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The age of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 60 years or older in 391 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining with ubiquitin antibodies facilitated the identification of LB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their specific density was measured (number per 100xfield) following a protocol in the predilection neocortical sites, entorhinal cortex, hippocampal gyrus, diencephalon and brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We assessed the clinical features according to LB findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve brains (2.1%) had neocortical LB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine of them were diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752347" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="DLB">diffuse Lewy body disease</z:e> (DLBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One more brain had nigral and neocortical LB leading to a pathological diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 2 cases, the finding of neocortical LB seems to be either incidental or asymptomatic or preclinical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>Cognitive decline</z:hpo> was mild to moderate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects which had neocortical LB in 4 or more areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the density of these LB does not correlate with the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was associated with minor parkinsonian symptoms and psychiatric features in the most of patients with DLBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thirty eight cases of the 391 (9.7%) older than 60 years in these series had been clinically diagnosed as senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Using accepted neuropathologic criteria, diagnoses were AD (63.1%), DLBD (21.05%) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (13.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These observation suggest that on consultant diagnosis of senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, DLBD must be taken in account </plain></SENT>
