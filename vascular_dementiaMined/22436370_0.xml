<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Ageing, a common background in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, is usually associated with painful disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the use of <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesics</z:chebi> is limited due to poor communication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> lesions are placed in the nociceptive pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this reason, the painful experience becomes different and distinctive for every lesional type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>COURSE: The lateral nociceptive pathway (lateral thalamic nuclei and primary parietal cortex), which is in charge of the primary pain perception, is preserved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, the shear painful perception, including pain intensity and threshold, remains unmodified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Distinctly, the medial pain pathways are affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this pathway are included: the intralaminar thalamic nuclei, the pons (locus ceruleus:LC), the mesencephalon (periaacueductal grey substance: PGS), the hypothalamus (paraventricular nuclei, mamilary tuberculum) and different areas of the parietal (primary, secondary, operculum), temporal (amigdala, hypoccampus) and frontal (anterior cingular: ACC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, the features of pain executed by these areas will be compromised: the cognitive assessment, the mood and emotion inherent to pain, the pain memory or the autonomic responses are modified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Specifically, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) there is a reduction in the anticipatory and avoidance responses and also a flattening of the autonomic responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These are essentially secondary to the degenerative changes in the medial temporal (pain memory) and ACC (cognitive and mood aspects) areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>, there is a cortico-subcortical deafferentation secondary to the white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The consequence is the presence of hyperpathy and <z:mp ids='MP_0005407'>hyperalgesia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementias</z:hpo>, there is a reduction in pain expressivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It is linked to the lesions in the orbitofrontal and anterior temporal areas, which are responsible of the emotional aspects of pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e>, painful conditions are a common characteristic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>They are attributed to an early lesion in the LC, which reduces its prominent antinociceptive activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Finally, in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients there is a lack of expectations to <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This means an absence of the placebo effect, which is, alongside the pharmacokinetic action, an inherent part of the <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The placebo response is related to activity in the ACC and PGS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Giving its lack, higher doses of <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesics</z:chebi> are necessary in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of pain in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is rather complex, which is the main reason for the scarcity of the <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>It must be specific and systematic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, the pain scales are a useful tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>For communicative patients, simple visual scales are helpful, meanwhile in the non-communicative patients the multidimensional scales are the most suitable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>By this means, the expressive, motor, emotional, functional and social interactions are evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Pain may be responsible of progression and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>This evolution could be reversible, and consequently it has to be foreseen in order to implement <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Trying to minimize adverse events, it has to be potent but closely monitored </plain></SENT>
