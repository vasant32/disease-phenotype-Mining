<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) is the second most common form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), and one of the major causes of mental and physical disability in developed countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As such, the identification and implementation of strategies which prevent the development of the condition or enable improvements in patients with VaD are healthcare objectives of the first order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>VaD is now regarded as a combined group of clinical-pathological entities rather than one disease, that is, multiple pathogenic mechanisms and lesion types underlie a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> of vascular origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical diagnosis of VaD is complex and difficult because of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> nature of its clinical presentation and progression and the low sensitivity of existing clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there is growing evidence of the epidemiological significance of mixed forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and that ischemic processes may precipitate and exacerbate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Numerous compounds have been proposed as potentially useful in the treatment of patients with VaD, comprising vasodilatative, antithrombotic, hemorrheological, nootropic, antiserotoninergic and, most recently, antiglutamatergic and cholinergic approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In spite of some initially favorable reports based on the use of memantine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> and galantamine, there is as yet no conclusive evidence of a definitive treatment for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unsatisfactory results from VaD drug trials may be attributed in part to the diversity of the patients included (underlying pathogenic mechanisms, number, type, and location of vascular lesions), and to methodological limitations in the design of the trials (outcome measures, end-points, size, follow-up period) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The treatment of modifiable vascular risk factors - <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> - is an important strategy for the reduction of the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and is likely to slow the progress of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
