<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cumulative evidence suggests that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MetS) may be important in the development of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As such, these patients might be described as having "metabolic-cognitive syndrome"--MetS plus <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> of degenerative or vascular origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> appears to be of primary pathophysiological importance in MetS, the definitions of MetS and its components do not include any reference to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present article, we discuss the role of these factors in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, including underlying mechanisms that influence amyloid-beta (Abeta) <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> metabolism and tau protein hyperphosphorylation, the principal neuropathological hallmarks of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In AD, an age-related desynchronization of biological systems results, involving stress components, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi>, reactive oxygen species, and membrane damage as major candidates that precipitates an insulin resistant brain state (IRBS) with decreased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>/energy metabolism and the increased formation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein and Abeta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, it is very difficult to include the measurement of peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in the current MetS criteria or the identification of IRBS for the metabolic-cognitive syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, since <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> has been suggested among the MetS components, we propose IRBS as an additional feature of the metabolic-cognitive syndrome to also identify a molecular profile in patients at high risk of developing predementia or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
