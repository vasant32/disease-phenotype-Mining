<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Free intracellular calcium ([<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i) represents probably the most important intracellular messenger for many signal transduction pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to this crucial role of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i, it has been assumed that alterations of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i are critically involved in brain aging and in the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis is corroborated by several studies demonstrating changes of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i in peripheral cells from AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the findings are still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using blood lymphocytes and neutrophils as two different peripheral model systems, we evaluated several parameters of intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> regulation in a very large group of AD patients and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found no major difference in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> homeostasis, since neither the basal [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i, nor the activation-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> responses differed among neutrophils or lymphocytes from aged controls and AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, we observed a delayed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> response of AD lymphocytes after phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation indicating an impaired function of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> influx-controlling mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we studied whether differences exist in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> regulation between lymphocytes from patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and AD patients, to define AD-specific alterations and to distinguish between the two <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> control subjects respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>First evidences indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> mobilization in lymphocytes is specifically impaired in lymphocytes from patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
