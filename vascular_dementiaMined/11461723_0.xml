<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is now increasingly recognized that not only is VaD a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> syndrome but also that VaD and AD are not mutually exclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the currently used criteria may no longer be sufficient for an accurate diagnosis of VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, although it is widely assumed that risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> are also risk factors for VaD, the evidence, in most cases, is circumstantial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the effective prevention of VaD, therefore, large-scale and long-term clinical trials are required to investigate the validity of these putative risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These trials should also include the VaD subtypes in their outcome measurements and to this end a simplified classification system should be adopted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional large-scale trials are required to facilitate the secondary prevention and symptomatic treatment of VaD, in particular to investigate the potential application of several nootropic and neuroprotective drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both cases, these clinical trials should aim to move the field of VaD from opinion-based medicine to evidence-based medicine </plain></SENT>
