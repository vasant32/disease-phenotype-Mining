<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Small cerebrovascular lesions are one of the most important factors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> (CAA) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the difference of arteriolar pathology between CAA patients (CAAs) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients without CAA (VaDs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten deceased CAAs and twelve deceased VaDs were available for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five deceased patients without known cerebrovascular diseases served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> autopsy cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> transversely cut arterioles in the gray matter and white matter with an external diameter equal to or larger than 30 microm and with a maximum of 300 microm were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The internal and external diameters of arterioles were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The external diameter of gray matter arterioles in the CAAs was significantly greater than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In gray matter arterioles, the diameter of the lumen in VaDs was markedly smaller than in the CAAs, whereas there was no significant difference between CAAs and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CAAs and VaDs may cause remarkable thickening of the arteriolar walls in either white matter or gray matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The sclerotic index of arterioles in VaDs was significantly greater than in CAAs and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stenosis of arterioles occurred in both CAA and VaD, but the tendency was greater in VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Arterioles of CAA were also expanded in gray matter, which may be related to lobar <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The loss and/or degeneration of vascular smooth muscle cells was predominant in CAA, while the over-proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells was greater in VaD </plain></SENT>
