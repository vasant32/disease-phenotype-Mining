<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) polymorphism is hypothesized to regulate insulin levels as well as processes involved in neuronal compromise found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the association of IDE haplotypes with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and insulin levels in a single well-characterized cohort of Japanese-American men born between 1900 and 1919 and followed since 1965 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 1991, a fasting insulin was obtained; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases were ascertained in 1991 and 1994 in a multi-stage procedure, diagnoses were made according to international guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped and used for haplotype analysis in a sample of 179 Alzheimer's disease cases, 104 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases and 516 controls nested in the total cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The global test for the haplotype effect on insulin levels was significant (p &lt; 0.0001), adjusting for age, education, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> epsilon4 status and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was no association of IDE haplotypes with the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study suggests IDE may be indirectly related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> via its regulation of insulin levels, but it is not a major gene for Alzheimer's </plain></SENT>
