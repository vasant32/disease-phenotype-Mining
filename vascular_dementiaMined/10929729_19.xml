<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Meningeal <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and/or obliteration of the subarachnoid space have been suggested as one of the patho-anatomical substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, predominantly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo>, may mimic the clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to correlate cerebral parenchymal and leptomeningeal biopsy findings to the clinical outcome after CSF shunting in a prospective group of idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> (INPH) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study comprises 27 patients with INPH, diagnosed and shunted according to generally accepted clinical, imaging and hydrodynamic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients a frontal leptomeningeal and brain biopsy was obtained prior to the shunt insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Degenerative cerebral changes, most often Alzheimer (6 cases) or vascular changes (7 cases) were described in 14 out of 27 biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Arachnoid <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> was found in 9 of the 18 biopsies containing arachnoid tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, nine patients (33%) improved, of whom 6 presented Alzheimer or vascular changes in their biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between clinical outcome and the presence or absence of degenerative cerebral changes and/or arachnoid <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, a tendency towards higher improvement rates was noted in the subgroups presenting degenerative cerebral changes or arachnoid <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that no constant morphological element exists in the syndrome of INPH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Various aetiologies may be involved in the pathogenesis and possibly in some cases co-existing: Patients may also improve by shunting despite the presence of degenerative cerebral parenchymal changes </plain></SENT>
