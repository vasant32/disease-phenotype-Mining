<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies have shown that midlife systolic blood pressure (SBP) predicts late-life <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study explores whether this association is attributable to the pulsatile, ie, pulse pressure (PP), or the nonpulsatile component of blood pressure (BP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data are from the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study, a community-based study of Japanese American men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Midlife BP was measured in 1971 to 1974 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> assessment was conducted in late-life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 2505 men who were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> free in 1991 and had complete follow-up data were re-examined for incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in 1994 to 1996 and 1997 to 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their age ranged from 71 to 93 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival analysis with age as the time scale was performed to estimate the risk (hazard ratio [HR] and 95% CI) for incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> associated with mid- and late-life tertiles of PP and mean arterial BP, as well as SBP and diastolic BP categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over a mean of 5.1 years of follow-up, 189 cases (7.5%) of incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for cerebrovascular risk factors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was significantly associated with SBP (HR 1.77; 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.84, for SBP &gt; or =140 mm Hg compared with SBP &lt;120 mm Hg), but not with PP tertiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Limiting the analysis to those never treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensives</z:chebi>, high levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 BP components were significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In models with 2 BP components, only SBP remained significant in both the total sample and the never-treated subgroup (HR 2.29; 95% CI, 1.23 to 4.25, for SBP &gt; or =140 mm Hg in total sample), whereas PP was not significantly associated with the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Midlife PP is not independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Midlife SBP is the strongest BP component predicting incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
