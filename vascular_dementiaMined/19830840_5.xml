<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is increasing evidence that <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> may be involved in several diseases of the white matter, including multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are increased in rat and mouse models of hypoxic hypoperfusion and have been associated with OLG <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, whether the MMPs act on myelin or OLGs remains unresolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that delayed expression of MMPs caused OLG <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and myelin breakdown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis, adult mice underwent hypoxic hypoperfusion with transient bilateral occlusion of the carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 3 days of reperfusion, ischemic white matter had increased reactivity of astrocytes and microglia, MMP-2 localization in astrocytes, and increased protein expression and activity of MMP-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was a significant loss of myelin basic protein (MBP) by Western blot and caspase-3- mediated OLG <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with the broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor, BB-94, significantly decreased astrocyte reactivity and MMP-2 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More importantly, it reduced MBP breakdown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, MMP inhibition had no effect on OLG loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results implicate MMPs released by reactive astrocytes in delayed myelin degradation, while OLG <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurs by an MMP-independent mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We propose that MMP-mediated myelin loss is important in hypoxic injury to the white matter </plain></SENT>
