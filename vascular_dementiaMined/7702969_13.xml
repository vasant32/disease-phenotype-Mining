<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>By means of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-fluorodopa (FDOPA), a study was initiated to analyze the cerebral <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> (<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>) metabolism of 32 subjects including those with AD/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD, multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> type) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A semiautomated irregular ROI drawing routine to identify the striatum was developed that interactively defined the PET threshold pixels referring to the count histograms and location of the corresponding pixels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A comparative study by five examiners showed significant improvement in the area size definition and count linearity particularly for low contrast objects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The graphical plot was employed to calculate the FDOPA influx rate (Ki) for the ROI data with cerebellar radioactivity as an input function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The striatal Ki value was found to be relatively stable and did not show signs of a significant age-related change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The vascular patients had smaller Ki to the striatum than the aged control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the mean Ki of AD/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> was almost compatible with that of age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath>, their Ki was more scattered with higher and lower Ki cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The multiple regression analysis revealed that the Ki could be predicted by age and the mini-mental state (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi>) performance (r2 = 0.590, p &lt; 0.01 for AD/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e>, r2 = 0.401, and p &lt; 0.05 for VD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> was found to be a more dominant factor than age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> metabolism became disturbed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> became progressively severe </plain></SENT>
