<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Epidemiological study, door-to-door, double phase, in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non-institutionalized subjects from 8 rural villages aged 70 and more were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The general physicians and nurses, previously trained, administered the Mini Cognitive Examination (MCE) in the first phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects to whom cannot been administered MCE due to illness or sensorial deficit, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects under the cut-off point and a similar number of subjects randomized among the ones over the cut-off point, get through the second phase in which a clinical psychologist and a neurological trained physician administered the Cambridge <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e> of the Elderly Examination (CAMDEX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> diagnosis were done under CAMDEX criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1,460 subjects participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 16.3% (14.4-18.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> Alzheimer type ratio was 40.76% (34.5-47), the vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 38.24% (32.1-44.4), the mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 11.7% (7.7-15.8) and the secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 9.2% (5.5-12.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The logistic regression confirms that age and female sex are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our geographical area a very high prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is found </plain></SENT>
