<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Of the study population more than 65 years of age (n = 2171), 1674 persons participated in the cross-sectional survey using the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE-K) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Subjects were defined as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria through direct interview by psychiatrists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 436 subjects were selected randomly according to MMSE-K scores, and cases were confirmed as having either Alzheimer's or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The adjusted prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was estimated at 9.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of total <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 8.8% for men and 9.9% for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> was 3.2% for men and 5.3% for women and that of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> 3.1% and 2.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age-standardized prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> was 4.5%, whereas that of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 2.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R criteria to stratify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients according to severity showed the prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> was 3.4%, 0.7%, and 0.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results showed that the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in Korea was similar to its presence in Western countries but different from that previously reported in other Asian countries, e.g., China and Japan </plain></SENT>
