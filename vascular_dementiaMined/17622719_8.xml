<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0010521'>Gait apraxia</z:hpo> characterized primarily by gait ignition failure has been linked to lesions involving the dorsomedial frontal lobes, but the precise locus within this general region has not been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has previously been hypothesized by Thompson and Marsden that disease, disconnection, or dysfunction of supplementary motor area (SMA) may account for the similarities in the gait disorders observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, frontal lobe lesions, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reevaluate this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical description and MRI of 2 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010521'>gait apraxia</z:hpo> characterized primarily by gait ignition failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both subjects had incapacitating gait disorders characterized by particular difficulty with initiating gait and making turns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both had MRI-demonstrated lesions of the SMA region, parasagittal convexity premotor cortex, or subjacent white matter bilaterally, one due to primary <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, one due to a lobar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In both these cases, the lesions were substantially more limited and focal than any reported heretofore in the literature on <z:hpo ids='HP_0010521'>gait apraxia</z:hpo> or freezing of gait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinicopathologic correlation in these cases provides partial support for the Thompson and Marsden hypothesis, but also may implicate parasagittal convexity premotor cortex in the genesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010521'>gait apraxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
