<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of QNYZ-treated serum and QNYZ on the proliferation of human arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SMCs did not grow in a medium containing 10% QNYZ serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>QNYZ also completely inhibited the proliferation of SMCs at higher concentrations (500-1000 microg/ml), although no detectable inhibitory activity on the SMC proliferation was observed at lower concentrations (100-200 microg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, QNYZ (250-500 microg/ml) significantly stimulated the proliferation of ECs and prostacyclin production in ECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that QNYZ may have suppressive effects on the development of intimal thickening in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and after arterial wall injury </plain></SENT>
