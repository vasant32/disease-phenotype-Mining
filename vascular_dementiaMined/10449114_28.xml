<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Based on the national Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA), to compare 5-year overall mortality and causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in elderly with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine how frequently <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was mentioned on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For people who underwent a clinical examination in 1991 (n = 2,923), overall and cause-specific mortality rate ratios were calculated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> status (AD; vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>/other <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>; and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognition), age group (65 to 74, 75 to 84, 85+ years), and sex, using the Canadian general population as the reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar rate ratios were calculated for people in the community who screened negative for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and who did not undergo a clinical examination (n = 7,340) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among elderly diagnosed as having AD or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> through the CSHA and who later died, it was determined how frequently <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was recorded on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The subgroup without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> had a survival rate similar to that of the overall Canadian population except in the oldest age group, where the survival rate was better than that of the general population, which includes people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>People in the three groups with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> had a poorer survival in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age/sex groups than those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and the general Canadian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups were from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>People with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> had the highest relative mortality rates for heart and cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most of the AD groups also had high relative vascular system mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among patients clinically diagnosed with AD, only 14.3% had any dementing illness recorded as the underlying cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>; 41.8% had any dementing illness recorded anywhere on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, the corresponding numbers were 5.8% and 23.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Elderly with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> have clearly increased mortality rates relative to elderly without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age/sex categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>People with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> have a particularly poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Studies of AD and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> using <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificate data will grossly underestimate the proportions of elderly with these diseases </plain></SENT>
