<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor blockers (ARBs) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors</z:chebi> (ACE-Is) are more strongly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>, than other anti-hypertensive drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a nested case-control analysis within the UK general practice research database, with prospectively recorded anti-hypertensive prescribing data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sampled cases aged â‰¥60 years and diagnosed between 1997-2008 (5,797 with AD, 2,186 with VaD, 1,214 with unspecified/other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) which were matched to up to four controls by age, general practice and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We computed odds-ratios and dose response effects for AD, vascular and unspecified/other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, comparing those prescribed ARBs or ACE-Is for at least six months with patients prescribed other anti-hypertensives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We controlled for matching factors, co-morbidities, smoking status, an area measure of socioeconomic status, consultation rate and blood pressure and accounted for reverse causality by introducing time-lags of up to eight years prior to diagnosis/index date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients diagnosed with AD, vascular and unspecified/other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> had fewer prescriptions for ARBs and ACE-Is </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inverse associations with AD were strongest for ARBs (odds-ratio; 0.47, 95%CI, 0.37-0.58) compared with ACE-Is (odds-ratio; 0.76, 95%CI, 0.69-0.84) (p(difference) &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Associations of ARBs with AD were stronger than for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (p(difference) = 0.01) and unspecified/other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (p(difference) = 0.23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were inverse dose-response relationships between ARBs and ACE-Is with AD (both p(trend) &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The inverse association of ACE-Is with AD diminished when using longer time lags but the ARB-AD association persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with AD were around half as likely to be prescribed ARBs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further randomized controlled trial evidence is required to rigorously test these findings </plain></SENT>
