<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Clinical investigators from Seattle, Honolulu, Tokyo, and Hiroshima participated in two standardization exercises in which data were collected on independent assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exercises were conducted to evaluate the interobserver agreement on clinical diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtypes in a cross-national study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> prevalence and incidence rates in the United States and Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Fifteen clinicians from four participating sites assessed the diagnosis of 85 patients based on standardized summaries of clinical and diagnostic test data on each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic guidelines and conventions were adopted on the basis of group consensus during standardization exercises </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R criteria, generally good levels of agreement for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnostic categories occurred in both years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For most measures of diagnostic agreement, improvements were observed between the 1995 and 1996 standardization sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interrater agreement was highest for discrimination between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and nondementia (1996 overall kappa, K = .90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The kappa values for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtypes in 1996 ranged from .5 to .85, and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sites combined the value was .67 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtypes, percent agreement was highest for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, but was less reliable for other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians from different cultures and medical traditions can reliably use the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R criteria to classify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases in cross-national research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The interrater agreement on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and its subtypes improved after clear-cut guidelines for interpretation of diagnostic criteria were developed and followed </plain></SENT>
