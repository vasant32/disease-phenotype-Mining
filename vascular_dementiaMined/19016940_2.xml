<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A two-phase, cross-sectional study of randomly selected population from central Singapore with disproportionate race stratification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Community-based study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects screened to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> at phase 1 in their homes were evaluated clinically for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at phase 2 in nearby community centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen thousand eight hundred seventeen subjects aged 50 and older (67% participation rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: The locally validated Abbreviated Mental Test was used to screen for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> at phase 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was diagnosed at phase 2 as per Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e>, Fourth Edition criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and possible vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) were diagnosed along the National Institute of Neurological and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009460" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Communicative Disorders</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> and Related Disorders Association and National Institute of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neuroscienes criteria, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall age- and race-standardized <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> prevalence was 1.26% (95% confidence interval (CI)=1.10-1.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prevalence (in 5-year age bands) was 0.08% (50-54), 0.08% (55-59), 0.44% (60-64), 1.16% (65-69), 1.84% (70-74), 3.26% (75-79), 8.35% (80-84), and 16.42% (&gt;/=85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From age 50 to 69, 65% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases were VD; at older ages, 60% were AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression (adjusted for age, sex, education) showed that Malays had twice the risk for AD as Chinese, and Indians had more than twice the risk for AD and VD than Chinese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Singapore's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> prevalence, primarily influenced by its Chinese majority, is lower than seen in the West </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The striking interethnic differences suggest a need for a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> incidence study and further investigation of underlying genetic and cultural differences between the three ethnic groups in relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
