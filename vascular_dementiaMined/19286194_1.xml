<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this pilot study was to investigate whether ultrasound parameters, particularly beta stiffness index (BSI), should be further explored as independent markers or risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: There were 38 demented patients included in this study (72.53+/-7.87 yrs) and 33 clinically healthy controls (68.85+/-3.52 yrs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Risk factors were noted and ultrasound measurements performed on common carotid artery (CCA) using eTracking software on Aloka ProSound ALPHA 10 with 13 MHz linear probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Level of significance was p&lt;0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was present in 24 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in 9, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 3, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> in 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was present as a single risk factor in 15 controls with average diastolic blood pressure significantly lower in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher in patients were mean intima-media thickness, systolic and diastolic CCA diameters (CD), and mean BSI in CCA bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analysis for groups of Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> proved that MMSE of the two groups relates to CCA diameter change (CDc) and BSI change explaining up to 5% of variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CD, CDc and BSI should be monitored in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and further explored as possible independent markers or risk factors; in future studies groups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients should be age, sex and risk factor matched </plain></SENT>
