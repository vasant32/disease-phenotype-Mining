<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CADASIL is a widespread <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> characterized by a degeneration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and the abnormal accumulation of electron-dense granular material called GOM and Notch3 protein, because of an impaired clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evidence that VSMCs are the primary target of the pathogenic process is supported by the restricted expression of Notch3 in these cells but mechanisms of their degeneration remain essentially unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We generated transgenic mice in which the SM22alpha promoter drove, in VSMCs, the expression of a full-length human Notch3 carrying the Arg90Cys mutation, a CADASIL archetypal mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transgenic mice showed no evidence of prominent brain parenchyma damage but demonstrated the two hallmarks of the CADASIL <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e>, GOM deposits and Notch3 accumulation, within both the cerebral and peripheral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of interest, arteries of the tail were more severely affected with prominent signs of VSMC degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Time-course analysis of vessel changes revealed that disruption of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> VSMC anchorage to adjacent extracellular matrix and cells, VSMC cytoskeleton changes as well as starting signs of VSMC degeneration, which were detected around 10 months of age, preceded Notch3 and GOM accumulation appearance, which were observed only by 14 to 16 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have generated transgenic mice that recapitulate the characteristic vascular lesions observed in CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that Notch3 or GOM accumulation are unlikely to be the prerequisites for the induction of VSMC degeneration and suggest that degeneration of VSMCs may rather be triggered by the disruption of their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> anchorage, based on the important role of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> for cell survival </plain></SENT>
