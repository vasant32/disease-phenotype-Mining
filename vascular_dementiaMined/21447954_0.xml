<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 289 patients were divided into three groups (140 mild, 99 moderate, and 50 severe) depending on the degree of white matter changes as indicated on brain magnetic resonance image scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further, we analyzed the three groups' performances on basic and instrumental ADL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The degree of white matter changes was associated with greater age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, previous history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, higher Hachinski Ischemic Score, worse global cognitive and functional status, and an increased impairment of basic ADL and instrumental ADL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increased impairment with regard to the severe group's performance on both the basic and instrumental ADL remained significant after adjustment for age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tasks involving physical activities were most significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was the first study investigating the association between white matter changes and ADL in a large, well-defined <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that severe white matter changes may be associated with higher impairment on both basic and instrumental ADL </plain></SENT>
