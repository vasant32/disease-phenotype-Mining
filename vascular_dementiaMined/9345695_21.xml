<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The IVD and AD patients were individually matched on the basis of age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity, years of education, and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The IVD patients had poorer verbal fluency, but better free recall, fewer recal intrusions, and better recognition memory than the AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relationships between the neuropsychological measures and radiological indexes of cortical and subcortical pathology were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, white-matter lucency, and ventricular enlargement correlated with some of the neuropsychological measures; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> correlated with most of the measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that neuropsychological deficits in IVD may be related to dysfunction of frontal-subcortical circuits, although an associated degenerative cortical process may also be involved </plain></SENT>
