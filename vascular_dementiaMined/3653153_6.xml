<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant decrease in the activities of both esterases was observed in CSF of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients, however, primary degenerative and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> did not differ in their CSF cholinesterase levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared to age-matched controls the serum butyrylcholinesterase activity was also significantly lowered in the overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No typical serum and CSF cholinesterase isoenzyme pattern was found for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or any of its subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the cholinesterase levels reflect metabolic alterations associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> as a collective group but cannot be used for differential diagnosis of subgroups </plain></SENT>
