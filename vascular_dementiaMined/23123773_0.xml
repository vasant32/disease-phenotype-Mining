<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and somatosensory evoked magnetic field and auditory evoked magnetic field changes in elderly male patients with subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (SIVD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Magnetoencephalography (MEG) was used to record evoked magnetic field changes from 4 SIVD patients (76-88 years), 3 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VCI-ND; 74-87 years), and 6 healthy volunteers (72-85 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Latency peaks, equivalent current dipole (<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp>) strength, and bilateral <z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> position were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The MEG data were superimposed on magnetic resonance imaging to produce magnetic source imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to controls, SIVD patients showed increased M20 latency and <z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> strength </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in M20 inter-hemispheric positions across diagnostic categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At M100, SIVD patients showed delayed auditory evoked magnetic field latency compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, <z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> strength and 3-dimensional inter-hemispheric differences were similar across the groups at the M100 measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Changes in somatosensory and auditory evoked magnetic field changes correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in SIVD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Magnetic field latency measures may provide an objective and sensitive index for early <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> detection and monitoring of cognitive function </plain></SENT>
