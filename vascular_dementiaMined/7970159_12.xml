<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Compared with results for the controls, the VDBT patients had unaltered concentrations of alpha-TOH, but a statistically significant, 3.6-fold increase of alpha-TQ (P &lt; 0.01) which was significantly correlated with decreases in the Mini-Mental State Examination scores (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, ATD patients had significantly decreased concentrations of alpha-TOH (P &lt; 0.01), but had unaltered concentrations of alpha-TQ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that there is greater oxidation of alpha-TOH to alpha-TQ in VDBT brain, but are inconclusive about the occurrence of peroxidation in ATD brains </plain></SENT>
