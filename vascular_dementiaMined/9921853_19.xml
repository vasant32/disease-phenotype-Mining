<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Establishment of incidence estimates is important for the future planning of the health care system, and incidence studies can offer insights into risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 5,237 persons age 65 to 84 years were randomly drawn among people living in the municipality of Odense, Denmark </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of this sample 3,086 persons were eligible for the incidence study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants were examined with CAMCOG, the cognitive section of The Cambridge Examination for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e> of the Elderly (CAMDEX), and the follow-up period was 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using multiple linear regression, the CAMCOG cutoff score was individualized to detect even minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> with optimal precision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Possibly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> persons were further examined with the remaining part of the CAMDEX and neuropsychological tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AD was diagnosed according to National Institute of Neurological and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009460" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Communicative Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> and Related Disorders Association criteria for probable AD, and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of other types were diagnosed according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e> (3rd ed., revised) criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was determined according to the Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence rate for very mild to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 29.5 per 1,000 person-years and 20.9 for AD, and the rates were similar for men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Application of an individualized cutoff for the screening instrument resulted in detection of a substantial number of cases with very mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, which subsequently resulted in higher incidence rates than those reported in most other studies </plain></SENT>
