<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For 24 patients with suspected initial vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> according to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R, structured neurological, neuropsychological and neuroimaging (magnetic resonance tomography) examinations were evaluated alongside computerized gait analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients revealed an increased variability of gait lines of various degrees: mild (11%), moderate (32%) and severe (57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lateralization of gait patterns was present in 68% and bipedal instabilities of posture in 54% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings were significantly correlated with frontal periventricular white matter lesions (WMLs), which probably affect the thalamo-cortico-mediocapsular pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait abnormalities</z:hpo> with WMLs of the frontocentral subcortical and periventricular territories in patients with possible vascular dementing illnesses may be used as an early indicator of the disease for follow-up and treatment trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, since the degree of gait impairment varies considerably relative to the common mild intellectual limitations, these structural lesions are unlikely to be directly related to the dementing process </plain></SENT>
