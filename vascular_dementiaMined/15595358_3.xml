<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As several studies have demonstrated that WMHs are often associated with severity of illness, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, and functional decline, the accurate and reliable measurement of WMHs on MRI is an important, yet often overlooked, prerequisite for accurate interpretation of neuroimaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a sample of 39 VaD patients, we evaluated the reliability and validity of a visual ordinal rating scale and a computer-mediated thresholding technique to evaluate WMHs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results indicated the computer-mediated technique had slightly stronger inter-rater reliability than the visual ordinal rating scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the computer-mediated thresholding technique was correlated with measures of neuropsychological functioning believed to be compromised in VaD (i.e., psychomotor speed, executive functioning) while the visual rating scale was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that this computer-mediated thresholding technique is superior to visual ratings of WMHs </plain></SENT>
