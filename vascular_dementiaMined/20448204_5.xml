<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We have previously described effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> in mice with bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (BCAS) using microcoils for 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These mice specifically exhibit working <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> attributable to frontal-subcortical circuit damage without apparent gray matter changes, indicating similarities with subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, as subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> progresses over time, the longer-term effects that characterize the mouse model are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Comprehensive behavioral test batteries and histological examinations were performed in mice subjected to BCAS for up to 8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laser speckle flowmetry and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography were performed to assess cerebral blood flow and metabolism at several time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 2 hours after BCAS, cerebral blood flow in the cerebral cortex temporarily decreased to as much as 60% to 70% of the control value but gradually recovered to &gt;80% at 1 to 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 5 to 6 months after BCAS, reference and working memory were impaired as demonstrated by the Barnes and radial arm maze tests, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography demonstrated that hippocampal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization was impaired at 6 months after BCAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these behavioral and <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>metabolic abnormalities</z:mp>, histological analyses demonstrated hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> with pyknotic and apoptotic cells at 8 months after BCAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the longer-term BCAS model replicates advanced stages of subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> when hippocampal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> becomes significant </plain></SENT>
