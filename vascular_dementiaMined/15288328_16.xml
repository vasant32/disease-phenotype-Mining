<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the neuropsychological profile of vascular CIND remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five healthy elders, 29 individuals at risk for cerebrovascular disease (R-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>), 18 individuals with VaCIND, and 26 individuals with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) were examined to determine whether patterns of neuropsychological assessment performance can assist in the differentiation of patients at varying levels of risk and severity for cerebrovascular disease and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The R-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> group performed within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> expectations on most cognitive measures as compared to the elderly control sample and published clinical norms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relative to elderly controls, the VaCIND group demonstrated significant difficulties on measures of cognitive flexibility, verbal retrieval, and verbal recognition memory, but not on measures of confrontational naming or verbal fluency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The VaD group was impaired on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cognitive measures assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The current findings suggest that poor cognitive flexibility and verbal retrieval in the context of preserved function in other domains may characterize the prodromal stage of VaD </plain></SENT>
