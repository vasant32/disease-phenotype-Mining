<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects were 78 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (20 males, 58 females) whose mean age was 80.5 +/- 6.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> subjects were 9 elderly persons (2 males, 7 females) whose mean age was 79.2 +/- 6.0 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The amplitudes of wave-I, -III and -V were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As for individual differences: (1) The amplitudes of BAEPs in the male group were lower than that in the female group, there was no significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(2) The amplitudes of wave-V in female patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were significantly lower than that of degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(3) The amplitudes of wave-III reduced as the duration of illness prolonged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dividing the patients into three groups according to the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> which are mild, moderate and severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(4) The amplitudes of the wave-V reduced significantly as the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> advanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly positive correlation between the amplitudes of the wave-V and the Hasegawa's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> scores (r = 0.404759, p &lt; 0.05) Based upon the above results, the brainstem dysfunction might progress with the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
