<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These subjects were randomly chosen in the general population of 75 communities of South-Western France </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present the results of the data collected from 2,792 subjects on the prevalence and the correlates of clinically diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> III criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were met by 101 subjects (3.62 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These cases were reviewed by a neurologist to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> using the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-three subjects were classified as probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>; 8 as possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>; 5 as vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; 5 as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; 2 as alcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; 2 as "dementified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000709'>psychosis</z:hpo>"; and 1 unclassified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients refused to be examined by the neurologist, 18 were false-positives, and 2 died before the neurologists visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was as low as 1.6 p </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> decreased dramatically as educational level increased, lung 5.4 p </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and educational level is still controversial in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In this study the sample was large and randomly selected; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> cases fulfilled the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This suggests that educational level is indeed an important correlate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the French elderly community </plain></SENT>
