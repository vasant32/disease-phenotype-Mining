<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> is a cause of disability in later life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the importance of functional status to the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, limited information exists on differences in functional limitations by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS) to determine the extent of functional impairment among older adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> due to different etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The ADAMS sample consisted of 856 individuals aged 71 years and older originally surveyed as part of the Health and Retirement Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on a comprehensive in-person cognitive evaluation, respondents were assigned to diagnostic categories of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> subtypes were grouped into three categories: vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> due to other etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For 744 of the 856 respondents, a proxy informant completed a questionnaire asking whether the respondent had difficulty completing instrumental activities of daily living and activities of daily living (ADLs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 744 ADAMS participants, 263 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>: 199 (70.5%) with AD, 42 (16.9%) with VaD, and 22 (12.6%) were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> due to other etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for demographics, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> illnesses, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity, participants with VaD (odds ratio [OR] 5.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.60-12.69) and other etiologies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (OR 21.23; 95% CI 7.25-62.16) were more likely to have greater than or equal to four ADL limitations compared with those with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: VaD is associated with significantly more ADL limitations than AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These physical limitations should be considered when designing adult day care programs, which adequately accommodate the needs of non-AD patients </plain></SENT>
