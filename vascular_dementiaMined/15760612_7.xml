<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alois Alzheimer, when defining the disease now bearing his name, did so in a patient with a presenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> elderly people were then believed to have cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> underlying their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The role of cortical vascular lesions, while clear to clinicians, was highlighted only later, by the pathological studies of Tomlinson et al. and the clinical demonstrations of Hachinski et al. who have defined multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lately, the emphasis shifted to pathogenic mechanisms for vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> with the identification of a multitude of processes, such as lipohyalinosis, cardiac dysfunction and genetic causes, to name only a few </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated the high frequency of vascular lesions in brains of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> individuals, as well as the fact that vascular factors can contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, many factors, which were identified as contributing to cerebrovascular disease in general and VaD in particular, are frequently suspected as predisposing to AD as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these considerations converge to the realization that vascular components are extremely important in the pathogenesis of old-age <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and that prevention and perhaps treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are within reach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These surprising findings highlight the importance of mixed vascular-degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> as a disorder that has to be properly defined </plain></SENT>
