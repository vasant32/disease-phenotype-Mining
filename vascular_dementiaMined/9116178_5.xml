<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The levels of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="25375">monoamine</z:chebi> metabolites 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), homovanillic acid (HVA), and 4-hydroxy-3-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32772">methoxy</z:chebi>-phenylglycol (HMPG) were determined in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 56 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VAD) and 57 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite CSF sampling under standardized conditions, the variability in values was wide among both patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This suggests that yet unknown factors affect the lumbar CSF concentrations of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="25375">monoamine</z:chebi> metabolites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The VAD group showed significantly lower mean concentrations of 5-HIAA (p &lt; .001) and HVA (p &lt; .001) than the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These low concentrations appear to be no disease-specific phenomenon, but may be attributable to subcortical white-matter changes or a decreased production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25375">monoamines</z:chebi>, which are dependent on oxygen for their synthesis </plain></SENT>
