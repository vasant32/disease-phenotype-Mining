<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the association of white matter signal hyperintensities (WMSHs) with changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29236">hydrogen-1</z:chebi> metabolites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: T2-weighted magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging and H-1 MR spectroscopic imaging were performed in 21 elderly control subjects without or with minimal WMSHs, eight elderly subjects with substantial WMSHs, 11 probable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> patients with WMSHs, and eight ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (IVD) patients with WMSHs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>N-acetylaspartate (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi>-containing metabolites (Cho), and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi>-containing metabolites (Cr) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Differences in regional metabolite levels were found within the supraventricular brain of elderly control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> patients, extensive WMSHs showed a lower percentage of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> and a higher percentage of Cho compared with contralateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing white matter (NAWM); in IVD patients, extensive and large WMSHs were associated with a higher percentage of Cho and a lower percentage of Cr compared with contralateral NAWM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Regional metabolite variation and the presence of WMSHs are important covariants that must be accounted for in analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopic data </plain></SENT>
