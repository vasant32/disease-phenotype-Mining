<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using the criteria of the NINCDS-ADRDA and NINDS-AIREN, 125 AD patients, 57 VaD patients and 109 ethnically matched nondemented controls were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The HSP70-1 -110 A/C and TNF-alpha -1031 T/C, -863 C/A and -857 C/T polymorphisms were analyzed by means of genotype or haplotype association methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of the four genotypes examined showed a statistically significant difference in genotype distribution between the AD cases and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the HSP70-1 -110 CC genotype occurred more frequently among AD cases (p=0.0821; odds ratio: 2.08; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.92-4.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall genotype distribution among the VaD cases tended to be different at the HSP70-1 -110 and TNF-alpha -1031 sites (p=0.0604 and 0.0316, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The HSP70-1 -110 CC genotype was more frequent (p=0.0459), and the association of the -110 CC genotype with VaD was evident (p=0.0207; odds ratio: 3.22; 95% CI: 1.20-8.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The more frequent TNF-alpha -1031 TC genotype (p=0.0614) was also evidently associated with VaD (p=0.0209; odds ratio: 2.32; 95% CI: 1.14-4.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis demonstrated the synergistic effect of the HSP70-1 -110 CC and TNF-alpha -1031 TC/CC genotypes on VaD (p=0.0091; odds ratio: 10.09; 95% CI: 2.01-75.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis among TNF-alpha -1031, -863, -857 sites revealed that -1031C-857C may act as a risk haplotype among VaD cases (p=0.0132, odds ratio: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.19-4.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest a potential protective role for HSP70 in both VaD and AD, whereas TNF-alpha may act as a risk factor only for VaD, and not for AD </plain></SENT>
