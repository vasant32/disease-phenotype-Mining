<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Another aim was to investigate the relations between the occurrence and degree of WMH and clinical and laboratory data as well as measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>White matter hyperintensities were assessed with a low field magnetic resonance imager on 23 subjects with probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 25 with possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and 31 subjects with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The degree and regional distribution of the WMH (expressed as relative volumes) were calculated and compared in the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and the degree of the WMH was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The regional distribution of the WMH differed between the groups with significantly more changes in the posterior part of the brain (p &lt; .0001) as well as in the right hemisphere (p &lt; .0005) in the vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> as compared to the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant correlations between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and the degree of the WMH were found in any of the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The total volume of the WMH as well as the regional distribution of these changes differed significantly between vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>White matter hyperintensities seem not to be related to the degree of global <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and whether it plays a causative role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> symptoms needs to be more thoroughly investigated </plain></SENT>
