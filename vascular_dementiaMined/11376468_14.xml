<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They have both raised olfactory thresholds and impaired odour identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The situation in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), a 40-item, forced choice, cued, 'scratch-and- sniff' test, to examine olfactory identification in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and to determine whether it would differentiate the disorder from AD and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated three matched subject groups: 13 people having a Cambridge Examination for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e> in the Elderly (CAMDEX) diagnosis of definite senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer type, 13 having a CAMDEX diagnosis of definite vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 13 non-cognitively impaired controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The subjects were then tested with the UPSIT in their own home by an independent blind researcher to see if the test could distinguish the different diagnostic groups in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median UPSIT score was 30 (out of a maximum of 40) for controls, 12 for the vascular group and 15 for the AD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference was significant (p = 0.05) between both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> groups and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly there was a significant difference in the UPSIT score between the AD group and controls (p = 0.001) and between the vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> group and controls (p = 0.001), but there was no significant difference between the AD group and the vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The UPSIT score correlated strongly with the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> as measured by the CAMCOG (r(s) = 0.683, p = 0.01) CONCLUSIONS: Patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> had a similar degree of olfactory impairment to those with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The UPSIT successfully differentiated between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly British subjects tested in their own homes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The UPSIT did not differentiate between those with AD and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
