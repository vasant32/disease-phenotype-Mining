<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A randomized controlled animal experiment was designed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 104 rats were involved in the present study and divided randomly into 4 groups: sham-operation group, model group, Jing-well Points group, and medication group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The VD model was established according to the modified 4-vessel occlusion (4-VO) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VD rats in the Jing-well Points group were treated by EA at the related Jing-well Points (HT 9, PC 9, KI 1 and LU 11) while those in the medication group were treated with nimotop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The step-down avoidance test was performed before and after treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Latency and error frequency indexed memory function were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) levels and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) activity in both cerebral tissue and serum were detected after the treatment course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 42 rats were included in the final analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with the model group, the latency in the Jing-well Points group was significantly prolonged (P &lt; 0.01) and the error frequency was significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.05) after therapy; the decrease in NO levels in both brain tissue and serum was significant (P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01, respectively); and the increase in SOD activity was also significant (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in latency, error frequency, NO levels and SOD activity between the Jing-well Points group and medication group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EA at related Jing-well Points can remarkably improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> in VD rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, decreasing the overproduction of NO and strengthening the ability of eliminating free radicals may provide therapeutic potential for the treatment of VD </plain></SENT>
