<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A group of 26 patients with SAE and a group of 16 age-matched healthy volunteers were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a well-established dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced MRI method, the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and blood volume (rCBV) were quantified for each subject in 12 different regions in the brain parenchyma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As compared to healthy volunteers, patients with SAE showed significantly reduced rCBF and rCBV values in white matter regions and in the occipital cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regions containing predominantly grey matter show almost <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rCBF and rCBV values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, quantitative analysis of rCBF and rCBV values demonstrates clearly that SAE is a disease that is associated with a reduced microcirculation predominantly in white matter </plain></SENT>
