<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In several longitudinal studies, light-to-moderate drinking of alcoholic beverages has been proposed as being protective against the development of age-related changes in cognitive function, predementia syndromes, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> of degenerative (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, AD) or vascular origin (vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, contrasting findings also exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The English literature published in this area before September 2011 was evaluated, and information relating to the various factors that may impact upon the relationship between alcohol consumption and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or predementia syndromes is presented in the succeeding texts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Light-to-moderate alcohol consumption may be associated with a reduced risk of incident overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and AD; however, protective benefits afforded to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>, and predementia syndromes are less clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The equivocal findings may relate to many of the studies being limited to cross-sectional designs, restrictions by age or gender, or incomplete ascertainment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Different outcomes, beverages, drinking patterns, and study follow-up periods or possible interactions with other lifestyle-related (e.g., smoking) or genetic factors (e.g., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E gene variation) may <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> contribute to the variability of findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Protective effects of moderate alcohol consumption against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> are suggested to be more likely in the absence of the AD-associated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E Îµ4 allele and where wine is the beverage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At present, there is no indication that light-to-moderate alcohol drinking would be harmful to cognition and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and attempts to define what might be deemed beneficial levels of alcohol intake in terms of cognitive performance would be highly problematic and contentious </plain></SENT>
