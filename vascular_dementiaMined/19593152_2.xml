<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The cognitive reserve hypothesis would predict that use of written Japanese should confer protection against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> because of the complexity of its ideograms compared with written English </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to test this hypothesis in analyses from a longitudinal study of Japanese-American men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants were second-generation Japanese-American men (Nisei) on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, who were seen in 1965 and in subsequent examinations to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> beginning in 1991-1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Use of spoken and written Japanese was self-reported in 1965 (Analyses 1 and 2), and midlife use of written Japanese and written English was self-reported in 1994-1996 (Analysis 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed prevalent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> outcomes in 1991-1993 (Analysis 1, n = 3139) using logistic regression, and incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> outcomes in 1994-2002 (Analysis 2, n = 2299) and in 1997-2002 (Analysis 3, n = 1655) using Cox proportional hazards regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> outcomes included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, probable and possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, and probable vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We adjusted models for probable and possible confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants who reported proficiency with written Japanese were older and had lower incomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For Analysis 1, there were 154 prevalent cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 74 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, and 43 of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; for Analysis 2, 236 incident cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 138 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, and 45 of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; and for Analysis 3, 125 incident cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 80 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, and 20 of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no relationship in adjusted models between self-reported proficiency with written Japanese and any <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Proficiency with written Japanese does not appear to be protective for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
