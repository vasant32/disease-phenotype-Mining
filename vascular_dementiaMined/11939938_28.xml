<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most neuroimaging studies of these disorders have involved comparisons with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to examine the clinical diagnostic value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) (in combination and in isolation) in the differentiation of one form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> from another from amongst a group of AD, FTD and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: T1 weighted MRI images and 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT images were obtained from consecutive patients with FTD (n=21), AD (n=23) and VaD (n=20) and rated visually by experienced neuroradiologists and nuclear medicine physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Asymmetrical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was seen only in FTD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>Frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> patients were the most atrophic whereas severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was rarely observed in VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severe frontal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (unilaterally or bilaterally) and/or asymmetrical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> on MRI is highly diagnostic (sensitivity 0.71, specificity 0.93, LR 10.24) of FTD from within a group of FTD and non-FTD (AD, VaD) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mild or severe parietal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> with severe reduction in parietal regional cerebral blood flow on SPECT is diagnostic (sensitivity 0.71, specificity 0.76, LR 3.02) of AD from within a group of AD and non-AD (VaD, FTD) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Anatomical (MRI) and functional (SPECT) imaging provide different information and a combination of these modalities improves diagnostic specificity </plain></SENT>
