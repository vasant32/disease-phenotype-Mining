<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Four cross-sectional examinations were conducted among residents of a Japanese community aged &gt;or=65 in 1985, 1992, 1998 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> significantly increased with time (6.0% in 1985, 4.4% in 1992, 5.3% in 1998 and 8.3% in 2005; P for trend = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A similar trend was observed for AD (1.1%, 1.3%, 2.3% and 3.8% respectively; P for trend &lt; 0.001), while the age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of VD and other/unclassified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> showed J-shaped patterns (for VD: 2.3%, 1.5%, 1.5% and 2.5%, respectively, P for trend = 0.82; for other/unclassified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>: 2.6%, 1.7%, 1.5% and 2.0%, P for trend = 0.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of AD was likely to increase with time from 1985 to 2005 among subjects aged 75 or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ratio of the prevalence of VD to that of AD decreased with time (2.1 in 1985, 1.2 in 1992, 0.7 in 1998 and 0.7 in 2005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and AD significantly increased over the past two decades in the general Japanese population </plain></SENT>
