<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The mice were subjected for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion repeatedly on bilateral common carotid arteries by knots to establish the VD models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals with the sham-operation were taken as control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The changes of behavior were observed through the step-down avoidance test and water maze test on the day 29, 30 after the operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hippocampal neurons were obtained immediately after mice were sacrificed and the resting [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i was measured using laser scanning confocal microscopy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5107">Fluo-3</z:chebi>/AM as fluorescence indicator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR technique was used to measure the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of CaM, CaMPKII in hippocampal neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) The abilities of learning and memorizing in model group were inferior to those of sham-operation group( P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(2) The resting [Ca2]i level in model group was significantly higher than sham-operation group (P &lt; 0.05), while the expression of CaMmRNA, CaMPKIImRNA in VD group was significantly reduced than sham-operation group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that excessive resting[<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> ]i level and lower CaM, CaMPKII expression in hippocampal neurons might participate in the pathogenesis of VD </plain></SENT>
