<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We optimized the sensitivity of the assay so that the inhibition of alpha-chymotrypsin could be measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The competitive inhibition was proportional to the amount of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) added to the reaction mixture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After correction for protein concentration, the inhibition was higher with CSF from patients with senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer's type than with those from patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inhibitory activity appeared to be specific for alpha-chymotrypsin because no inhibition for papain was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of alpha 1-antichymotrypsin from CSF by immunoadsorption revealed that this serpin was responsible for the disappearance of the inhibitory activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggested that the increased alpha-chymotrypsin inhibitory activity might represent an in vivo functional index of an abnormal protease metabolism in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
