<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to assess the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the Geriatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale (GDS-15 and GDS-5) in PWD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, five healthcare centers providing care for PWD from two cities in Spain participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ninety-six community-dwelling PWD aged 55 years and older, living with a known caregiver, completed a battery of scales including the GDS-15 and GDS-5, the Cornell Scale <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> (CSDD), a list of self-reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> health conditions (yes/no), severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (Mini-Mental State Examination), functional status (Barthel Index), generic quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF), and sociodemographic information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cronbach's Î± coefficients were 0.81 and 0.72 for GDS-15 and GDS-5, respectively, providing evidence for acceptable internal consistency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant associations between the GDS-15/GDS-5, the Barthel Index, CSDD, and the WHOQOL-BREF were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found on GDS-15/GDS-5 scores among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnostic groups (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) or between mild (MMSE 21-26) and moderate (MMSE 10-20) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Participants self-reporting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> on the comorbid condition list (yes) scored significantly higher on the GDS-15 and GDS-5 compared to those who reported not having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exploratory factor analyses suggested a two-factor structure on GDS-15 which accounted for 41.6% of the variability, while the one-factor structure on the GDS-5 accounted for 48.1% of the variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In general, this study provides evidence that GDS-15 and GDS-5 are suitable measures for screening depressive symptoms in community-dwelling PWD </plain></SENT>
