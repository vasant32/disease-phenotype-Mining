<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A consecutive series of 83 individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003587'>insidious onset</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>progressive dementia</z:hpo> clinically diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) or small vessel vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) completed neuropsychological measures assessing working memory, visuoconstruction, episodic memory, and language </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A clinical MRI scan was used to quantify leukoaraiosis, total white matter, hippocampus, lacune, and intracranial volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed analyses to detect the lowest level of leukoaraiosis associated with impairment on the neuropsychological measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Leukoaraiosis ranged from 0.63% to 23.74% of participants' white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Leukoaraiosis explained a significant amount of variance in working memory performance when it involved 3% or more of the white matter with curve estimations showing the relationship to be nonlinear in nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Greater leukoaraiosis (13%) was implicated for impairment in visuoconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relationships between leukoaraiosis, episodic memory, and language measures were linear or flat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Leukoaraiosis involves specific threshold points for working memory and visuoconstructional tests in AD/VaD spectrum <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data underscore the need to better understand the threshold at which leukoaraiosis affects and alters the phenotypic expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003587'>insidious onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
