<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although cyclooxygenase (COX) expression has been reported in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, no information is available on the expression of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) and its topographical correlation to COX induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to elucidate the comparative distribution of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23899">eicosanoids</z:chebi> in ischemic tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>COX and 5- LO, key enzymes for the synthesis of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandins</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotrienes</z:chebi>, respectively, were examined in autopsied brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>COX1 was expressed intensely in the microglia but weakly in the neurons in control brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These COX1-immunoreactive microglia showed a more activated form following ischemic damage and hypoxemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, COX2 was absent in the control brains, and was induced robustly in the neuronal cell bodies and dendrites during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stages of focal ischemic damage, and then subsided at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These COX2-immunoreactive neurons accumulated in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> regions, but were absent from the distant regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In focal ischemic damage and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e>, COX2 was up-regulated in the microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neuronal immunostaining for 5-LO was up-regulated occasionally during hypoxemia and focal ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Glial cells immunoreactive for 5-LO appeared in the foci of the ischemic damage, with small blood vessels being infiltrated by 5-LO-immunoreactive mononuclear leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the isozymes of COX are differentially regulated depending on the cellular source and the types of ischemic damage, and that vascular 5-LO may accelerate the migration of leukocytes and augment the blood-brain barrier permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The possibility of increased substrate availability for the other should be noticed in specific inhibition of either COX or 5-LO since these two enzymes are accumulated in parallel in ischemic tissues </plain></SENT>
