<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Patients with AD (n=75) and VaD (n=46) were recruited from a memory clinic along with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-free participants (n=28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They underwent specific tests of attention from the Cognitive Drug Research battery, and pen and paper tests including Colour Trails A and B and Stroop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a CT brain scan that was independently scored for white-matter change/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Attention was impaired in both AD and VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VaD patients had more impaired choice reaction times and were less accurate on a vigilance test measuring sustained attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Deficits in selective and divided attention occurred in both patient groups and showed the strongest correlations with Mini Mental State Examination scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates problems with the attentional network in mild-moderate AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The authors propose that attention should be tested routinely in a memory clinic setting </plain></SENT>
