<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate the rate that subjects with Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>Memory Impairment</z:hpo> /Not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> (MMI/ND) shifted to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in a population-based cohort and to establish simple diagnostic methods for identification of high-risk persons for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects in a community-based elderly cohort of MMI/ND were followed longitudinally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were selected from the participants in the first Nakayama study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MMI/ND was defined as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficit</z:e> with objective memory assessment, without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, impairment of general cognitive function, or disability in activities of daily living </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The conversion rate was calculated using the person-year method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, the sample consisted of 104 subjects (59 female; 45 male) selected from 1,162 community dwellers aged over 65 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the five-year follow-up, 14 subjects died, 13 moved to other communities, and six refused to participate further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven (10.6%) subjects were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), five (4.8%) were diagnosed with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), and six (5.8%) were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of other etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The annual conversion rate that MMI/ND shifted to AD is calculated on 8.5% per 100 person-year, and shifted to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> on 16.1% per 100 person-year in this survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The rate at which subjects with MMI/ND whose conditions shifted to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was the same as the rate that subjects with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) shifted to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in a previous report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It would be useful to identify groups of high-risk individuals for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> by simple diagnostic methods </plain></SENT>
