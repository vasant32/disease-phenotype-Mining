<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological findings also differ within the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The inconsistent findings with respect to the neuropathology and neurobehavior of patients with histories of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085762" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="aca">alcohol abuse</z:e> may be due, at least in part, to differing nosology and the highly variable inclusion/exclusion criteria employed by researchers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oslin et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>[Int J Geriatr Psychiatry 1998;13:203-212] have proposed and recently validated specific criteria for probable alcohol-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (ARD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We were interested in comparing the neuropsychological profile of ARD patients with the neurocognitive profiles of typical cortical and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007123'>subcortical dementia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Participants included 14 ARD patients, 15 patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), 13 patients diagnosed with subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), and 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patient subgroups were similar with respect to age (mean = 79), education (mean = 12 years) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity (MMSE; mean = 22.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The three <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patient subgroups demonstrated significantly worse performance than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls subgroup on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> neuropsychological tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ARD subgroup exhibited very similar executive control deficits to VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the different neurocognitive profiles of the patient subgroups suggest that ARD patients may also, in fact, demonstrate some degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> given that they perform slightly worse than subcortical patients on delayed verbal free recall and recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, the ARD patients did not display as severe impairment as the AD patients on the memory tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No significant differences between the three patient groups were identified on language tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In sum, we present preliminary evidence of a distinct neuropsychological profile for ARD patients that includes impairment on both executive control and memory tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This pattern of performance suggests that long-term <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085762" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="aca">alcohol abuse</z:e>, in comparison to AD and VaD, may be associated with both cortical and subcortical neuropathology </plain></SENT>
