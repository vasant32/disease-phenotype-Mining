<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and reduced cerebral blood flow and VCI is documented and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in midlife is associated with a higher probability of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is a main cause of vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disorder</z:e> (VBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) is the rat strain most extensively investigated and used for assessing hypertensive brain damage and treatment of it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They are normotensive at birth and at 6months they have a sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Time-dependent rise of arterial blood pressure, the occurrence of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, loss of nerve cells and glial reaction are phenomena shared to some extent with hypertensive brain damage in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SHR present changes of some neurotransmitter systems that may have functional and behavioral relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An impaired cholinergic neurotransmission characterizes SHR, similarly as reported in patients affected by VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SHR are also characterized by a dopaminergic hypofunction and noradrenergic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> similarly as occurs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0007018'>attention-deficit</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> disorder (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Microanatomical, neurochemical and behavioral data on SHR are in favor of the hypothesis that this strain is a suitable model of VBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Changes in catecholaminergic transmission put forward SHR as a possible model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hence SHR could represent a multi-faced model of two important groups of pathologies, VBD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As for most models, researchers should always consider that SHR offer some similarities with corresponding human pathologies, but they do not suffer from the same disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This paper reviews the main microanatomical, neurochemical and behavioral characteristics of SHR with particular reference as an animal model of brain vascular injury </plain></SENT>
