<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The absolute expression levels of APP and PS1 genes were quantified in 45 AD patients, 25 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) and 60 healthy controls by real-time quantitative PCR using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51461">SYBR Green I</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The APP expression levels in healthy controls, AD cases and VD cases are 0.026+/-0.005, 0.044+/-0.006 and 0.072+/-0.013 amol/microg cDNA, respectively; and the PS1 expression levels are 0.026+/-0.004, 0.051+/-0.011 and 0.039+/-0.005 amol/microg cDNA, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both APP and PS1 expression levels were significantly elevated in AD or in VD cases (APP, AD vs Control, t=2.639, P&lt;0.01, VD vs Control, t=3.028P&lt;0.01; PS1, AD vs Control, t=2.173P&lt;0.05, VD vs Control, t=2.012P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It seems that elevated APP and PS1 gene expression is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> but not especially with AD </plain></SENT>
