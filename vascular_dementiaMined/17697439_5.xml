<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are elevated in the brain tissue of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and may play a role in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MMP-9 and tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) are elevated in postmortem brain tissue of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a previous study we showed that circulating levels of MMP-9 are elevated in AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to examine circulating levels of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in the plasma of patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI), AD, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (FTD), to determine, whether plasma profiles of MMPs and TIMPs differ in various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Gelatinolytic activity (MMP-2 and MMP-9) was measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> plasma samples by zymography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-1 as well as TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found constitutive expression of MMP-1, -2 and -9 as well as TIMP-1 and -2 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the samples investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As shown previously, MMP-9 was significantly elevated in the plasma of AD patients (p = 0.004) as compared to controls and MCI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of TIMP-1 were significantly lower in VD samples as compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Levels of TIMP-2 were significantly lower in patients with FTD as compared to AD, VaD and MCI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no significant changes of MMP-1 and MMP-2 levels in the samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that circulating levels of MMP-9, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 and changes in the MMP/TIMP balance in plasma differ in various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
