<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Given the expected increase in the older population and driving in this age group, concerns have been raised about the safety of older drivers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>People over 65 years are over-represented in motor vehicle fatalities when calculated by distance driven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They are also at risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo>, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, that affect cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have examined the brains of older drivers (15M:12F) who died as a result of a motor vehicle accident (MVA) to determine the extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>-related neurofibrillary changes (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>neuritic plaques</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo>), Lewy body pathology and cerebrovascular disease and compared them to a control group of older licenced drivers (23M:5F) who died of other causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of moderate or severe neuritic plaque pathology was less than expected for the general population of this age and there was no difference between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, mild neuritic plaque pathology was increased for MVA <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The current mandatory age-related re-licencing procedures in NSW may contribute to the low percentage of drivers with severe pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further research into the role of mild pathology in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and older drivers is warranted </plain></SENT>
