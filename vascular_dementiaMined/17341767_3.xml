<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors studied the validity of these new EFSs in 51 demented (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer's type, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) and nondemented individuals (depressives and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The new EFSs were found valid to accurately differentiate between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> and nondemented subjects; however, they were considerably less so when specific diagnoses were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlations between the variously combined executive scores and the cognitive scales and subscales studied were prevalently low to moderate, and ranged from high and significant to low and nonsignificant when the 4 executive items were correlated to each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ability of the executive scores to discriminate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> from nondemented individuals was lower compared with the Cambridge Cognitive Examination-Revised scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EFS was found internally consistent </plain></SENT>
