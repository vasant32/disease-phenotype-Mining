<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Genotypes of the solute carrier family 6 (neurotransmitter transporter, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>) member 4 (SLC6A4) have been variously associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000722'>obsessive-compulsive disorder</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Less clear are data regarding their association with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, in particular with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate the possible involvement of different SLC6A4 genotypes/haplotypes in VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The analysis of the 3 markers rs3813034, rs140701 and rs4795541 spanning the SLC6A4 locus was made in 541 consecutive patients clinically diagnosed as having VaD (n = 372) or no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (n = 169) attending a geriatric ward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A community-dwelling sample of 353 healthy subjects, as a reference for the genetic frequencies in the recruitment area, was also included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients and subjects were free from any symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000722'>obsessive-compulsive disorder</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A complete neuroimaging documentation was available for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No important differences were observed in genotype distribution across the study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, no important differences were observed in haplotype distribution when a 3-point analysis was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that polymorphism C in the promoter region of the SLC6A4 gene plays a minor role, if any, in the pathogenesis of VaD </plain></SENT>
