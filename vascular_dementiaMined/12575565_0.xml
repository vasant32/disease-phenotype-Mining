<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of Xianlong Capsule (XLC) in treating vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) and to explore its therapeutic mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The criteria of learning and memory related cholinergic nerve system, oxygen free radical and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16480">nitrogen monoxide</z:chebi> (NO) in 35 patients with VD treated with XLC and 33 patients treated with hydergine were observed and compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: XLC could lower the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> esterase activity, increase the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> content in erythrocytes and plasma and decrease the NO content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No toxic adverse reaction was found in the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: XLC has definite effect in treating VD in aged patients, the therapeutic mechanism may be related with the actions in strengthening cholinergic nerve system, improving oxygen free radical metabolism, regulating NO and relieving its excitatory neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
