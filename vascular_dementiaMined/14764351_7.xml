<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study examined the clinical usefulness of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) performed using an automated single voxel technique at 1.0 T field strength in a district general hospital magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) scanner in the assessment of older people referred to a memory clinic with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 50 elderly subjects (M:F 20:30) examined and followed-up clinically over more than 2 years, 20 had clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), 18 had clinical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, six had mixed features and three were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRS was performed at the same time as structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), added &lt;15 min to the examination and was well-tolerated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with AD had significantly higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17268">myoinositol</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> (MI/Cr) ratios (mean +/- S.D.: 0.82 +/- 0.04) compared to those with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (mean +/-S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>D.: 0.71 +/- 0.07, P&lt;0.00001) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (mean +/- S.D.: 0.72 +/- 0.036, P&lt;0.0002); there was little overlap between the AD and vascular groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> group also had significantly higher MI/Cr ratios (mean +/- S.D.: 0.80 +/- 0.05) than vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.01) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (P&lt;0.03) groups, but with considerable overlap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were shown for N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> ratios between the different clinical groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that MI/Cr ratios can distinguish patients with AD from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and those with sub-cortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and that MRS will be useful to clinicians managing persons with AD in a district general hospital setting </plain></SENT>
