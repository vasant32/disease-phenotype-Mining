<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, clinical diagnosis and results of neuropathological examination were analyzed on 55 demented patients serially autopsied in a geriatric hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on clinical observations including Hachinski's ischemic score and CT scan, 30 cases were diagnosed as vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), 16 cases as Alzheimer-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (ATD), 6 as mixed-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MD), and 5 as other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the results of neuropathological examination, 25 cases were diagnosed as ATD, 19 cases as VD, 5 as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752347" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="DLB">diffuse Lewy body disease</z:e> (DLBD), 4 as MD, and 2 as other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of the clinical diagnosis for ATD was 78.6%, and that for VD was 53.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, misdiagnosis was more frequent on VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinically, VD cases were rarely misdiagnosed as ATD, while ATD or MD cases were more frequently misdiagnosed as VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is suggested that VD is overdiagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of the reasons is that risk factors of cerebrovascular disorders increase and Hachinski's ischemic score also becomes higher with the age of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ATD is clinically diagnosed only after excluding other dementing illnesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More detailed analysis of clinical features including cognitive function and brain images is required for more accurate clinical diagnosis of age-related dementing illnesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Also in our series, DLBD was the second most frequent degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> following ATD, although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> DLBD cases were clinically misdiagnosed as ATD or VD </plain></SENT>
