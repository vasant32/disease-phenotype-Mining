<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two polymorphisms of PON1 [192 (R or Q) and 55 (M or L)] exist and are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that serum PON1 activity (PON1a) is lower in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), suggesting that PON1a may distinguish VaD from AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As PON1 polymorphism modifies PON1a, we determined 192 and 55 PON1 polymorphisms by sequence-specific primer PCR in 64 healthy subjects (HS; mean age: 79.5 +/- 6.3 years; 38 women) and in 72 patients (mean age: 80.2 +/- 6.8 years; 51 women) undergoing cognitive evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV/NINCDS/ADRDA/NINDS/AIREN criteria, 45 patients (mean age: 80.0 +/- 7.2 years, 34 women) had AD and 27 patients (mean age: 79.8 +/- 6.6 years, 16 women) had VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also measured serum PON1a by spectrophotometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in phenotype distributions among the three study groups were detected by chi(2) test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the variables, age, sex, and phenotypes 192 and 55, logistic regression selected only polymorphism 192, but not 55, as a discriminating factor between AD and VaD (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Substitution of serum PON1a for genotype yielded a similar result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PON1 polymorphism 192 appears to be a reliable marker to distinguish patients with AD from patients with VaD and from healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Changes in 192 polymorphism distributions in AD and in VaD may at least partially explain the significant difference in PON1a in these two types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
