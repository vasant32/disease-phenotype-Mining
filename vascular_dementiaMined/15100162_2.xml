<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have already described that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50509">potassium channel blockers</z:chebi> including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44296">tetraethylammonium</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="29" ids="28621,35026">TEA</z:chebi>), ammonia and MET are hypophagic in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antisense oligonucleotides (aODNs) against Shaker-like Kv1.1 gene abolished the effect of <z:chebi fb="29" ids="28621,35026">TEA</z:chebi> but not of ammonia and MET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The central effects elicited in fasted mice by ammonia and MET were further studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For MET, an ED(50) value 71.4+/-1.8 nmol mouse(-1) was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The slope of the dose-response curves for these two compounds and the partial hypophagic effect elicited by ammonia indicated a different action mechanism for these <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aODNs pretreatments capable of temporarily reducing the expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven known subtypes of Shaker-like gene or to inactivate specifically the Kv1.6 subtype abolished the hypophagic effect of MET but not that of ammonia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot and immunohistochemical results indicate that a full expression in the brain of Kv1.6 is required only for the activity of MET, and confirms the different action mechanism of ammonia and MET </plain></SENT>
