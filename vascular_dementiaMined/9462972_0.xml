<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most important risk factor for this is previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vascular accident</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To eliminate the risk factors and/or progression of this illness would be of considerable benefit to these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Triflusal, a platelet anti-aggregant chemically related to the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30762">salicylates</z:chebi>, whose clinical efficacy has been shown in cardiac and cerebrovascular pathology, has been used in the treatment of patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: An open study was done a sample of 73 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> randomly distributed into two groups (control and undergoing treatment with triflusal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: To check the efficacy of treatment with triflusal, the percentage of variation in the scoring of the Cognitive Mini Examination was used after a clinical course of 12 months (IVP 12), considering the critical point of no efficacy to be a loss equal or greater than 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the control group, 33% (8/24) and in the group treated with triflusal 8% (3/35) had a negative course which was greater than this critical point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The difference in the IVP 12 between the two groups was statistically significant (p = 0.0375), with a statistical power of 87% (beta = 0.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This gives triflusal a therapeutic activity which is sufficient to limit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e> of patient with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
