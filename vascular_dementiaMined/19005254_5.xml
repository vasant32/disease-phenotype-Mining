<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is a lack of evidence to explain why patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are admitted to a general hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Main reasons for hospitalisation were investigated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients admitted to a multi-ethnic general hospital during 2002-2007, by analysis of type of admission and primary diagnosis on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anonymised data from the Hospital Activity Analysis Register was used to trace these patients; 505 were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), 283 with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) and 1,773 patients were classified as unspecified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (UnD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis was used to compare these groups to 53,123 age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical significance of p &lt; 0.001 was accepted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: More <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients were admitted as emergency cases compared to controls (AD = 95.8%, VD = 95.4%, UnD = 96.7%, controls = 54.4%; p &lt; 0.001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients admitted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> as their primary diagnosis was small (AD = 5.9%, VD = 10.6%, UnD = 6.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Primary diagnoses such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> and collapse, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006285" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bronchopneumonia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>urinary tract infection</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo> were more frequent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> patients are frequently admitted as emergency cases, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> itself is often not the primary diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Earlier detection of the specific conditions mentioned above may reduce emergency hospital admissions amongst <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
