<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 60 patients with the clinical syndromes of the behavioural variant of FTD (FTD-bv) (n = 32), primary progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> (PPA) (n = 22), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">corticobasal degeneration</z:e> syndrome (CBDS) (n = 4) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSNP1">progressive supranuclear palsy</z:e> (PSP) (n = 2) at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, referred to a cognitive neurology clinic who had subsequent post-mortem examination were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most common histological variety was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085084" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">motor neurone disease</z:e> type inclusion (MNDI) (n = 18), followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">corticobasal degeneration</z:e> (CBD) (n = 12), then <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236642" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pick's disease</z:e> (n = 6), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> lacking distinctive histology (DLDH) (n = 6) and PSP (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Others fulfilled the histological criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> combined with glial pathology (n = 6), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> only (n = 4), Lewy body variant (n = 2), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162534" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prion disease</z:e> (n = 1), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n = 1) and undetermined (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common first syndrome among the MNDI and DLDH (tau negative) pathologies was FTD-bv, but subsequently progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> (PA), occasionally CBDS and semantic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> also developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tau positive histologies of CBD, PSP and Pick bodies were most frequently associated with PPA <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or CBDS/PSP, but behavioural symptoms were also common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>Age of onset</z:hpo> was earlier in tau negative cases, but the duration of illness and gender distribution were about the same in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> histological variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the tau negative and positive histologies are predicted to some extent by the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, the extent of the overlap and the convergence of the syndromes in the course of the disease argue in favour of maintaining the clinical and pathological varieties under a single umbrella </plain></SENT>
