<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the EGF repeats of the human Notch 3 receptor lead to the vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> disease Cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>Autosomal Dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Arteriopathy</z:e> with Subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>Leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> (CADASIL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of CADASIL mutations are missense mutations removing or inserting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32460">cysteine residues</z:chebi> in the EGF repeats, but it is not yet clear whether these mutations primarily affect receptor trafficking, maturation, andor signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To address this issue, we have generated and analyzed stable cell lines expressing either <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> murine Notch 3 (mNotch 3) or the mutant mNotch 3(R142C), which corresponds to the prevalent CADASIL form of Notch 3, Notch 3(R141C) in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We find that a lower proportion of mNotch 3(R142C) is expressed in the site 1-cleaved configuration, and that reduced amounts of mNotch 3(R142C) appear at the cell surface, as compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mNotch 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This observation is accompanied by a higher propensity for mNotch 3(R142C) to form intracellular aggregates, which may be a result of increased accumulation or slowed transport in the secretory pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the impaired cell surface expression, mNotch 3(R142C) signals equally well in response to Delta 1 and Jagged 1 as <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mNotch 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data suggest that trafficking and localization rather than signaling of mNotch 3 are affected in mNotch 3(R142C) </plain></SENT>
