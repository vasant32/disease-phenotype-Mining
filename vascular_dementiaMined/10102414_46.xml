<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and both vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and abnormalities of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism have been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and poor cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> and glycosylation have been postulated to be associated with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>neuritic plaques</z:hpo> characteristic of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A historical prospective cohort study of Japanese-American men (n = 3,774), who were examined at ages 45 to 68 (1965 through 1968) and again at ages 71 to 93 (1991 through 1993) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurements were obtained by clinical and home examinations: assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> (nonfasting 1 hour after <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load) from 1965 through 1968 and history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosed by a physician at examinations given from 1965 through 1968 and from 1976 through 1978 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the 1991 through 1993 examinations, the Cognitive Assessment Screening Instrument (CASI)-an instrument designed for use in cross-cultural settings combining features of the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination, the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination, and the Hasegawa <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Screening Scale-was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis and classification of AD and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were made by a consensus panel using neuropsychologic assessment data, a neurologist's evaluation, and information from a family informant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e>, 3rd ed., revised criteria were used to establish <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and subclassification by cause was based on other published criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No association between AD and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, present either 25 or 15 years previously, was found after adjustment for age and education in a multiple regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant association was found between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> at baseline and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm expected relationships between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> but do not support an association of disordered <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism with AD </plain></SENT>
