<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ApoE <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level in the skin fibroblasts was also determined by the Northern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As compared with the control subjects, the frequency of the ApoE epsilon 4 allele was significantly higher in the DAT group as well as the VD group, but was not significantly different in the cerebrovascular disease without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The skin fibroblast ApoE <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level in the DAT group and the VD group was significantly lower than that in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the phenotype of ApoE is associated with DAT and VD, and that the lower level of ApoE <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> may play an important role in the development of DAT as well as VD </plain></SENT>
