<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) represents a common cognitive state between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognitive aging and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is limited information about the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of MCI and how this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> may influence the clinical course of MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined the longitudinal course of subtypes of MCI and assessed the rate of progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: As part of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Research Centers of California, we studied 327 patients with MCI (250 with amnestic MCI, 34 with single nonmemory MCI, and 43 with multiple domain MCI) who were followed longitudinally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We determined if subtype of MCI was independently associated with time to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnosis and time to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> using Cox proportional hazard models, and type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> using Fisher's exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age of the patients with MCI was 72.9 +/- 9.3 years and mean Mini-Mental State Examination score was 25.7 +/- 4.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 3.1 years, 199 (65%) progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 80 (24%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After multivariate adjustment, compared to those with amnestic MCI, patients with single nonmemory or multiple subtype MCI were less likely to receive a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (HR = 0.60; 95% CI 0.35-1.05 and HR = 0.71; 95% CI 0.44-1.14) but more likely to die (HR = 2.57; 95% CI 1.13-5.84 and HR = 1.73; 95% CI 0.72-4.18), but these results were of borderline statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnosed across MCI subtypes (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the patients who progressed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 76% had prior amnestic MCI; of the patients who progressed to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 50% had prior amnestic MCI; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who progressed to a frontal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> syndrome had single nonmemory MCI previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with MCI progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and a significant proportion died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Subtype of MCI may influence rates of progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and has a major influence on subsequent type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
