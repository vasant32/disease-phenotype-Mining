<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This EEG study investigates the role of the cholinergic system, cortico-cortical connections, and sub-cortical white matter on the relationship between individual EEG frequencies and their relative power bands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: EEGs were recorded at rest in 30 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly subjects (Nold), 60 mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) and 20 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) patients, comparable for Mini Mental State Evaluation scores (MMSE 17-24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Individual EEG frequencies were indexed by the theta/alpha transition frequency (TF) and by the individual alpha frequency (IAF) with power peak in the extended alpha range (5-14 Hz) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relative power was separately computed for delta, theta, alpha1, alpha2, and alpha3 bands, on the basis of the TF and IAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects as a reference, VaD patients showed 'slowing' of alpha frequency (TF-IAF) and lower alpha2 power; Mild AD patients showed lower alpha2 and alpha3 power; delta power was higher in both AD and VaD patients; Theta power was higher only in VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Individual analysis of the alpha frequency and power can discriminate mild AD from VaD and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: This analysis may probe pathophysiological mechanisms causing AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
