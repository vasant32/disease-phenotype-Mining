<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine if anthropometric measures, as markers of early life environment, are associated with risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD), and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 2,798 subjects were followed as part of the Cardiovascular Health Cognition Study for an average of 5.4 years; 480 developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Knee height was measured 3 years prior to and arm span 4 years after the study's baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine their association with subsequent risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, AD, and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among women, greater knee height and arm span were associated with lower risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (knee height: HR per 1-inch increase 0.84; 95% CI 0.74-0.96; arm span: HR per 1-inch increase 0.93; 95% CI 0.88-0.98) and AD (knee height: HR per 1-inch increase 0.78; 95% CI 0.65-0.93; arm span: HR per 1-inch increase 0.90; 95% CI 0.85-0.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Women in the lowest quartile of arm span had approximately 1.5 times greater risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (HR 1.45; 95% CI 1.03-2.05) and AD (HR 1.70; 95% CI 1.10-2.62) than other women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among men, only arm span was associated with lower risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (HR per 1-inch increase 0.94; 95% CI 0.89-1.00) and AD (HR per 1-inch increase 0.92; 95% CI 0.84-1.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For each gender, knee height was not associated with VaD, while arm span was associated with a nonsignificant lower risk of VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings with knee height and arm span are consistent with previous reports and suggest early life environment may play an important role in the determination of future <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
