<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was more than double that of previous years, and raised concern for the staff </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (n = 17) occurred within 2 months of admission to the unit, and 16 of the patients who died had a diagnosis of vascular or mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presenting behaviors for these patients may be similar to those of pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000711'>restlessness</z:hpo>, a condition that may affect individuals in their last hours or days of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No literature can be found linking pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000711'>restlessness</z:hpo> with end-stage vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It may be a relief for family and staff to know the patient is indeed dying, rather than exhibiting new and seemingly uncontrollable behaviors </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Accurate nursing assessment, evaluation, communication, and documentation of both the behaviors and interventions is vital in supporting both patients and families </plain></SENT>
