<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the changes in the cholinergic pathways, which project from the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nBM) and travel in the subinsular region, in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger</z:e> type (VDBT) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subinsular regions were examined in 6 autopsied brains with VDBT, 5 brains with AD and 4 control brains without any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456669" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurologic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cholinergic pathway was labeled either by histochemistry for <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> esterase (AChE), a degradatory enzyme of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>, or by immunohistochemistry for <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase, its synthetic enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The numerical density of nBM neurons did not differ significantly between these groups (163 +/- 49 in the VDBT, 105 +/- 82 in the AD and 198 +/- 76 in the control groups), but with a tendency towards a decrease in the AD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The subinsular cholinergic fibers were impaired, with relative preservation of the nBM neurons in VDBT, whereas both the subinsular cholinergic fibers and the nBM neurons were degraded in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the cholinergic pathway is damaged not only in AD, but also in VDBT, and may further provide a pharmacological basis for treatment with AChE inhibitors in VDBT </plain></SENT>
