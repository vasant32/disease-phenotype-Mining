<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-three patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were randomly divided into two groups, the 33 patients in the treated group and the 30 in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Basal treatment were given to both groups, besides, KXC was given to the treated group and Hydergine was given to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The levels of plasma HCY, beta-Ap as well as the changes of mini mental state examination (MMSE), activity of daily living (ADL) and TCM Syndrome scoring were observed before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: KXC could significantly decrease the levels of HCY and beta-Ap (P &lt; 0.01), rise the MMSE scores, reduce ADL scores and ameliorate TCM Syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: KXC can effectively regulate the levels of HCY, beta-Ap in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
