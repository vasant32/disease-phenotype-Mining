<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A common polymorphism in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (APOE) gene is considered to be the major risk factor in families with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> as well as in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The distribution of alleles and genotypes of the APOE gene in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (N = 68), other late-life <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> (N = 39), and in cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (N = 58) was determined, as also was the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> associated with the epsilon4 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood samples were obtained from a total of 165 individuals living in Brazil aged 65-82 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and the products were digested with HhaI restriction enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>APOE epsilon2 frequency was considerably lower in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> group (1%), and the epsilon3 allele and epsilon3/epsilon3 genotype frequencies were higher in the controls (84 and 72%, respectively) as were the epsilon4 allele and epsilon3/epsilon4 genotype frequencies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (25 and 41%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The higher frequency of the epsilon4 allele in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> confirmed its role as a risk factor, while epsilon2 provided a weak protection against development of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in view of the unexpectedly low frequency of the epsilon4 allele, additional analyses in a more varied Brazilian sample are needed to clarify the real contribution of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> in this population </plain></SENT>
