<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cerebellum has traditionally been seen as a brain area limited to the coordination of voluntary movement, gait, posture, speech, and motor functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are increasing evidence, however, proving that the cerebellum is implicated in processes associated with the control of cognition, behavior, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychiatric illness</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the fact that the cerebellum is reciprocally connected to a broad range of limbic structures including the amygdale and hippocampus, as well as the cerebral cortex including the prefrontal areas, provides a strong neuroanatomical argument in favor of cerebellar involvement in cognition regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studies have already found the fact that after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the cerebellum suffered from reduction in metabolism and blood flow in the cerebellar hemisphere contralateral to a destructive cerebral lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The notion of crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) may contribute to the explanation of the phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consequently, theoretically, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in any part of the brain including frontal lobe and hippocampus, will affect cerebellar function and the later then results in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More recently, a few clinical trials found that electrical stimulation of fastigial nucleus (FNS) in cerebellum could improve symptom of VD, though the relationship between cerebellum and VD is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, there seems to be sufficient empirical ground to assume that the cerebellum plays a role in the regulation of VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The hypotheses of cerebellar role in VD, which will be discussed in this paper, if confirmed, may lead to the formulation of new pathogenesis and new therapeutic approaches to VD </plain></SENT>
