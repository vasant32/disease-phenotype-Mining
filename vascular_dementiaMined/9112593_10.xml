<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The potential role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in differentiating between specific causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) has not yet been fully established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore decided to assess the supratentorial cerebral contents in 24 patients with a diagnosis of probable VD and in 24 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, matched for age and education level, using MRI volumetric parameters obtained by means of a quantitative method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The volumes of subarachnoid and ventricular spaces, cerebral tissue, and hyperintense areas on T2-weighted images were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to reduce interindividual variability caused by differences in intracranial size, each absolute measurement was normalized to the relative size of the intracranial volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we calculated the ratio between the areas of the corpus callosum (CC) and supratentorial brain at the same level on the T1-weighted image midsagittal plane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The MRI data were correlated with the deterioration of cognitive functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with VD showed significantly lower cerebral tissue volume and CC area, and higher ventricular space volume than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the total volume of the T2 signal alterations was higher in VD patients than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In VD patients, this volume was found to be proportional to the increase in the volume of the ventricular space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, no correlation was found between the volume of the T2 signal alterations and the area of the CC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The degree of global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> and the score of each neuropsychological test did not show any correlation with the MRI data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that ventricular enlargement in VD patients is correlated with the increase in volume of the T2 signal abnormalities, but that the degree of global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> is not influenced by the volume of these T2 signal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the CC <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> does not influence the score of any neuropsychological test or the degree of global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
