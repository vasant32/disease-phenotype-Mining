<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial, 788 patients with probable VaD who also satisfied strict centrally read MRI criteria were randomized to receive galantamine or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Efficacy was evaluated using measures of cognition, daily function, and behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy measures were the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog/11) and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL) total score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes included the Clinician's Interview Based on Impression of Change-Plus Caregiver Input (CIBIC-plus), Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and EXIT-25 for assessment of executive functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Safety and tolerability were also monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients treated with galantamine had a greater improvement in ADAS-cog/11 after 26 weeks compared with placebo (-1.8 vs -0.3; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between galantamine and placebo at week 26 on the ADCS-ADL score (0.7 vs 1.3; p = 0.783) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Improvement in global functioning measured by the CIBIC-plus associated with galantamine approached significance (p = 0.069) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A difference between treatment groups for EXIT-25 favoring galantamine was detected (p = 0.041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Safety data revealed that 13% of galantamine and 6% of placebo patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Significance was not reached for both co-primary endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Galantamine was effective for improving cognition, including executive function, in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, with good safety and tolerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, improvement in activities of daily living with galantamine was similar to that observed with placebo </plain></SENT>
