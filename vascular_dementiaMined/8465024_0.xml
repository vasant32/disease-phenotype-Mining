<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them were intensively evaluated considering both the clinical and neuropsychological aspects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of these patients were diagnosed of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> following the criteria proposed by Bennett et al for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was compared with the rest of patients with leucoaraiosis from the radiological, semiological and neuropsychological aspects; the incidence of vascular risk factors and the score obtained in the Ischemic Scale were also compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> have, in the CAT study, more severe periventricular lesions than the rest of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have not found any significative differences in the incidence of vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Deambulation disorders, constructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002186'>apraxia</z:hpo> and visual-perceptive disorders were the symptoms more strongly related with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, even tough only the latter two showed this relationship in the statistical multivariant analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differences in the score of test and scales were highly significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We think that Bennett's criteria are of great value for the clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
