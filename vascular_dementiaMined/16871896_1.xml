<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, other basic neuropsychological tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating (CDR) were also used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Generally, with the VAMT, AD patients had a worse performance than VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Particularly among patients with a CDR = 0.5, the AD patients had statistically significantly lower VAMT scores (score less than 3) (p = 0.026) compared to those of VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the VAMT could not predict clinical severity or disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The VAMT, as revealed in this study, is a brief, simply administered, and less biased test, and may offer a diagnostic adjunct to differentiate AD from VaD especially in an early <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> state </plain></SENT>
