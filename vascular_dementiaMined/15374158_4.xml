<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A statistical comparative study was carried out between two subgroups of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, i.e. 22 with Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD, 44% of the entire Alzheimer group examined) and 36 with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD, 97% of the entire vascular group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The selection of the two subgroups was based on a similar EEG spectral profile in the rest eyes closed condition: a great increase in low frequency powers and a dominant activity in the 6.5-12 Hz band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim was to identify any possible difference between the two groups analysing the spectral descriptors, of the two conditions eyes closed and open, the demographic figures and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>mental deterioration</z:hpo> scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results are as follows: (i) the spectral profiles and their numerical descriptors of the AD subgroup patients are not distinguishable from the same parametric figures of the VaD patients; (ii) the spectral analysis becomes useful in differentiating the two types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> when a dynamic EEG is processed, i.e. the power ratio of recordings during eyes closed and open; (iii) a more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>mental deterioration</z:hpo>, especially in attention and spatial and temporal orientation was found in the AD group as compared to the VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings are explained in the light of the changes in neural mechanisms which underlie both the alpha and slow rhythms </plain></SENT>
