<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aims at evaluating the relationship between plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or atherosclerotic small vessel disease </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) were significantly lower in VaD patients than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> levels, serum levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), max <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and plaque frequency were significantly greater in VaD patients than in controls </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that increased plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> and carotid plaque prevalence had significantly independent association with VaD as compared with serum levels of IGF-1, HGF, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and hs-CRP </plain></SENT>
