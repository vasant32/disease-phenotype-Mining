<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a 77-year-old woman with cerebrovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in whom acupuncture reproducibly induced an increase of blood flow velocity but a decrease of regional oxygen saturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At four of 11 acupuncture sessions, blood flow velocity was measured in the middle cerebral artery with transcranial Doppler sonography and cerebral regional oxygen saturation (rSO(2)) with transcranial near infrared spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow velocity increased by an average of 20% (range: 7-27%) at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four study points whereas rSO(2) consistently decreased by an average of 7% (range: 4-13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical status and cognitive function improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings in a patient with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> may suggest increased oxygen extraction by activated neuronal structures </plain></SENT>
