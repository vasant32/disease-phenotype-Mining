<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aberrant protein glycosylation has been recognized to play major roles in human disorders, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to examine possible involvement of protein genetic variants and degree of glycosylation of some serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> in the manifestation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> in a Czech population sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">Apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (Apo) E and three main serum markers of glycosylation defects (transferrin, Tf, alpha1-antitrypsin, aAT and ApoCIII) in patients with Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n=62, 139 and 44, respectively) were analyzed by isoelectric focusing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Children with serious neurological symptoms (n=55) and three age-matched control groups (n=45, 45 and 42) were examined for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the supposedly pathognomonic protein variants Tf C2, aAT ZM and ApoE e4 only the latter was detected with higher frequency in AD patients; significant synergy of the C2/e4 allelic combination was not confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most prominent finding among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> adults was an increased appearance of Tf C2 allele and significant mean hypoglycosylation of ApoCIII, besides a C2/e4 positive correlation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> seniors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Laboratory signs of Tf hypoglycosylation and a pattern of Tf/ApoCIII hyperglycosylation have been occasionally found </plain></SENT>
