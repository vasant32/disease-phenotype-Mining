<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The roles of several demographic, psychometric, and biological indices in predicting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e> were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sample consisted of 36 very old (M age at entry = 83.0 years, range = 75-95) adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> from a community-based study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were tested on two occasions separated by approximately 2.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results indicated significant longitudinal decline in MMSE scores over the retest interval; the average decline was estimated as 2.43 (SD = 1.81) points per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several factors were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher initial MMSE scores were associated with greater deterioration, whereas superior forward digit span and Block Design at entry were associated with attenuated decline, once differences in baseline severity were accounted for </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, a variety of other putatively important variables exhibited no relationship to decline, including age, gender, education, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> type, backward digit span, as well as a number of biological parameters (e.g., <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that although the magnitude of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is highly variable, several indicators may be useful predictors of future changes in cognitive functioning </plain></SENT>
