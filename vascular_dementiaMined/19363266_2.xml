<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This population-based retrospective cohort study was designed to evaluate factors associated with total hospital length-of-stay (tLOS) in the last year of life (1990-2005) in Western Australians with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using linked hospital and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> records, 29,884 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The average tLOS in the last year of life for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases was 31.8 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>tLOS was longer for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (41 versus 28 days; Rate Ratio (RR) 1.4; 95% CI 1.3-1.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After multivariate adjustment, tLOS was longer for males than females (RR 1.4; 95% CI 1.3-1.4); longer for remote (RR 1.7; 95% CI 1.4-2.0) and very remote (RR 3.0; 95% CI 2.4-3.9) compared to metropolitan areas; and shorter with increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>62% of admissions were emergency admissions. "Problems accessing alternative medical facilities" and "problems related to care provider dependency" accounted for a total of 16.4% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> bed days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> spend a considerable period of time in the hospital during their last year of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consideration of geographic isolation and accessibility to non-hospital facilities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-related healthcare planning may liberate in-patient beds for more elective and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> care admissions </plain></SENT>
