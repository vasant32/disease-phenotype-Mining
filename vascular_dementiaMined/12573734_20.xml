<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> is a common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> illness, affecting approximately 16 million Americans, and is slightly more common in women than men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data from population studies demonstrate that women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are at greater risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, the leading cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> among women and an independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal epidemiologic studies report an association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, but conflicting data on the association between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whether type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> has an effect on cognitive function, independent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, has received much attention since the 1980s, but the question remains unresolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The literature was rigorously reviewed for studies in which cognitive functioning was measured with neuropsychological (NP) tests in participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and a control/comparison group without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 32 studies that reported the effects of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on cognition in nondemented middle-aged and older adults, 30 included women in their samples, and two focused exclusively on women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of studies that included women, 20 (67%) reported that participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> performed more poorly than those without diabetics on one or more NP tests, leading the authors to conclude that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is positively associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Owing to the small number of studies with adequate numbers of women to report findings by gender, little is known about the effect of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on cognition in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is critical that studies on type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and cognitive functioning be designed to include women in numbers adequate for examination of gender effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The discussion addresses issues specific to women that warrant further research </plain></SENT>
