<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The number of people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> has increased dramatically with global ageing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the pathogeneses of these diseases are not sufficiently understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study aims to analyse the relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038443" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological stress</z:e> in midlife and the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in late-life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A representative sample of females (n = 1462) aged 38-60 years were examined in 1968-69 and re-examined in 1974-75, 1980-81, 1992-93 and 2000-03 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038443" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Psychological stress</z:e> was rated according to a standardized question in 1968, 1974 and 1980 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was diagnosed according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e> criteria based on information from neuropsychiatric examinations, informant interviews, hospital records and registry data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the 35-year follow-up, 161 females developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (105 Alzheimer's disease, 40 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 16 other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (hazard ratios, 95% confidence intervals) was increased in females reporting frequent/constant stress in 1968 (1.60, 1.10-2.34), in 1974 (1.65, 1.12-2.41) and in 1980 (1.60, 1.01-2.52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Frequent/constant stress reported in 1968 and 1974 was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reporting stress at one, two or three examinations was related to a sequentially higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared to females reporting no stress, hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were 1.10 (0.71-1.71) for females reporting frequent/constant stress at one examination, 1.73 (1.01-2.95) for those reporting stress at two examinations and 2.51 (1.33-4.77) at three examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To conclude, we found an association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038443" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological stress</z:e> in middle-aged women and development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, especially <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>More studies are needed to confirm our findings and to study potential neurobiological mechanisms of these associations </plain></SENT>
