<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether microvascular damage, indicated by cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> microvascular signs, is associated with cognitive function and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in older persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of 3,906 participants (mean age 76 years; 58% women) in the AGES-Reykjavik Study (2002-2006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed CMBs on MRI and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> microvascular signs on digital <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Composite Z scores of memory, processing speed, and executive function were derived from a battery of neurocognitive tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> and subtypes were diagnosed following international criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regression models were used to relate cognitive Z scores and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> to CMBs and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> microvascular signs, adjusting for demographics, cardiovascular factors, and brain ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: People with multiple (≥ 2) CMBs had lower Z scores on tests of processing speed (β-coefficient -0.16; 95% confidence interval -0.26 to -0.05) and executive function (-0.14; -0.24 to -0.04); results were strongest for having multiple CMBs located in the deep hemispheric or infratentorial areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 2.32 (95% confidence interval 1.02 to 5.25) for multiple CMBs and 1.95 (1.04 to 3.62) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Having both CMBs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, compared to having neither, was significantly associated with markedly slower processing speed (-0.25; -0.37 to -0.12), poorer executive function (-0.19; -0.31 to -0.07), and an increased odds ratio of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (3.10; 1.11 to 8.62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Having multiple CMBs or concomitant CMBs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> is associated with a profile of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that microvascular damage, as indicated by CMBs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> lesions, has functional consequences in older men and women living in the community </plain></SENT>
