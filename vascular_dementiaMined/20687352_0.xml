<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL/METHODS: The sample consisted of 155 persons investigated who were divided into four groups: the control group Y (44 persons, the mean age of 64.6 years) and 3 groups of patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group A (47 persons, the mean age of 65.6 years) with Alzheimer-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, group N (46 patients, the mean age of 64.8 years) with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and Group M (15 patients, the mean age of 65.3 years) with mixed type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Imaging (MRI) and spectroscopic (1HMRS) examinations were performed using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> Signa Horizon 1.5 T system (GEMS) with the use of a standard volume head coil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A single voxel spectroscopy (SVS) was used, with VOI located in the following areas: frontal, paraventricular, parietooccipital and the hippocampus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Qualitative analysis of the spectrum was made (the profile analysis) as well as quantitative analysis and the relative concentration ratios (RCR) were calculated for selected metabolites (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>, Cho, ml, Cr); the Cr concentration was assumed as the internal standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Detailed analysis of each group was made followed by the comparison with Group Y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 1HMRS spectra in the patients with Alzheimer-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> reveal characteristic changes: the increase in ml/Cr RCR and the decrease in <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/ ml RCRs, which were statistically significant almost for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There is a clear change in the spectrum profile: the lowered <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> peak and elevated ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the RCRs of the patients with angiogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> no characteristic changes were found either in the quantitative or qualitative spectrum analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the appearance of Lip and Lac peaks allows coming to the conclusion indicating the angiogenic character of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>. the quantitative analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, in the qualitative analysis in the patients in that group an elevated ml peak always occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The appearance of Lip and Lac peaks with elevated ml peak allows coming to the conclusion indicating the mixed character of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: On the base of the results obtainedit may be concluded that both the data of the analysis of the RCRs for selected metabolites (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>, Cho, Cr, ml) and spectra allow the diagnosis of Alzheimer-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
