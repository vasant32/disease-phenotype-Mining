<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Virchow-Robin spaces (VRSs) surround perforating cerebral arteries and are reported to be found with increasing frequency with advancing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, some studies indicate an association between VRSs and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study examined the incidence of VRSs in patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (INPH) and considered their use as a potential surrogate imaging marker of coexisting microvascular disease in patients with this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The MRI incidence of VRS in the centrum semiovale (CS), basal ganglia (BG), mesencephalon (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>), and the subinsular (SI) region was measured in 12 patients with INPH and in 12 control subjects, using the scoring system proposed by Patankar et al </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Historical control data were also used for further comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 12 INPH patients had clearly visible VRSs, distributed in the CS (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12), basal ganglia (11/12), SI region (9/12), and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> region (6/12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean Patankar scores of the INPH group were BG 2.25, CS 1.66, SI 0.91, and ME 0.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The respective scores for our control group were 1.41, 1.5, 1.16, and 0.16, and for historical controls were 1.46, 0.51, 0.96, and 0.51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were, however, no statistically significant differences between the INPH patients and either of the control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between age and the overall incidence of VRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This preliminary study suggests that there may be a higher incidence of VRSs in patients with INPH, when compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patients of similar age, but our small numbers prevent us from demonstrating statistical significance, and larger studies are clearly required </plain></SENT>
