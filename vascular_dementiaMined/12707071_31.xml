<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The validity of the clinical diagnosis of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) remains suboptimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate clinicopathologic correlations in VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the medical records-linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology Project to identify incident cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in Rochester, Minn, from January 1, 1985, through December 31, 1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) were defined by the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e>, Fourth Edition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was defined by criteria including imaging results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pathological characteristics of AD were quantified by means of standard scoring methods for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>neuritic plaques</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vascular pathological findings were assessed by expert neuropathological opinion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 419 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> who died before the study, neuropathological examination results were available in 89 (21%) with median age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of 80 years (range, 50-96 years; 52 [58%] women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pathological diagnoses were AD in 45 patients (51%), pure VaD in 12 (13%), combined AD and VaD in 11 (12%), and other diagnoses in the remaining 21 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Criteria for VaD that required either a temporal relationship between a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or worsening, or bilateral infarctions in specified locations demonstrated on imaging results (Mayo Clinic criteria) had 75% sensitivity and 81% specificity for pure VaD (positive likelihood ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval, 2.2-6.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five cases of pure VaD lacked the temporal relationship and accounted for the imperfect sensitivity of the criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based autopsy study, the presence of vascular pathological characteristics in the absence of major AD pathological findings was common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pure VaD without overt clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> remains a challenge for antemortem diagnosis </plain></SENT>
