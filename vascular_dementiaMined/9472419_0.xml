<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A negative correlation between P300 amplitude and MHPG concentration, negative correlation between P200 and N200 latencies and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> concentration, positive correlation between N200 latency and lysine concentration and positive correlation between N100 amplitude and tyrosine concentration were statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the noradrenergic system influences P300 amplitude, and that multiple systems may influence P300 components </plain></SENT>
