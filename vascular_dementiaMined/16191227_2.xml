<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There has been a move in recent years to recognize that the most effective treatment for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and for the mixed component of mixed vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, lies not in treatment but in prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This requires that cases be identified before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of vascular damage (a stage termed "brain-at-risk") or, failing this, as soon as possible but certainly before <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> has developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These early stages are termed vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (VCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No criteria exist for this early stage of cognitive loss due to cerebrovascular disease and relatively little data exist to indicate how such cases might be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data that do exist suggest that many of the traditional "vascular" features of sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and stepwise progression, etc., are not common in VCI and new criteria will be needed to identify cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This paper summarizes the data that describe the clinical, neuropsychological, and radiological features that are to be expected in VCI </plain></SENT>
