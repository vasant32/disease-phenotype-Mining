<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Paratonia is a progressive motor problem that is observed in individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and is not a well-known phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study explores the development and risk factors of paratonia in moderate stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A multi-center, longitudinal, one-year follow-up cohort study was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with an established diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, with a score of 6 or lower on the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The participants were assessed using the Paratonia Assessment Instrument (PAI), the Timed Up and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> test, the Qualidem, the Global Deterioration Scale (Reisberg et al., 1982) and the Mini-mental State Examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Information about each patient's diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, comorbidities and use of medication were obtained from the participant's medical file </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The PAI was assessed every three months, the other variables at baseline and after 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cross-tabulation χ2 and logistic regression tests were used for the statistical analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline measures were assessed in the 204 participants - 111 (54%) female and 93 (46%) male, with a mean age of 79.8 years (56-97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seventy-one patients (34.8%) were diagnosed with paratonia at baseline, and 51 patients developed paratonia over one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The highest hazard ratio (3.1) for developing paratonia within one year was observed in the vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The logistic regression analysis revealed that the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (OR = 10.7) was significantly related to the development of paratonia (Wald χ2 p-value &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and likely vascular damage are risk factors for the development of paratonia </plain></SENT>
