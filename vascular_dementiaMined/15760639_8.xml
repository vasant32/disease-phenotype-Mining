<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most frequent neurotoxic effect of RT at any age is diffuse cerebral injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain injury by therapeutic irradiation has traditionally been classified according to its time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> into <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, early delayed, and late forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The latter is not reversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neurocognitive sequelae of cranial irradiation can be mediated through vascular injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because the pathologic changes are most profound in the white matter, we compared a group of patients treated by RT (n=34) with a group of patients affected by subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (sVaD, n=34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with a total radiation does &lt;35 cGy did not show any sign of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients with a total irradiation dose &gt;45 cGy did show profound cognitive and behavioural alteration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients who received a total dose of brain radiation comprised between 35 and 45 cGy did show slowness of executive function, and profound alterations of frontal functions, such as attention focusing, mentation control, analogical judgement and insight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients who suffered from the consequences of RT had slowness of executive functions, and profound alterations of frontal functions, such as attention focusing, mentation control, analogical judgement and insight, similar to those obtained by the patients suffering from subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>High dose RT might result in a severely <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e>, bedridden patient, who "has been cured" from his <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e>, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006118" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This constellation demands serious consideration before RT is given </plain></SENT>
