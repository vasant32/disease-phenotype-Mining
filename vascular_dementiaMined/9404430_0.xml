<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Syst-Eur is a double-blind placebo-controlled outcome trial conducted in European patients over 60 years of age with isolated systolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a side-project--the Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Project--is designed to assess cognitive functions and to follow-up their evolution to determine the influence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> therapy on vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cognitive functions were evaluated at entry with the MiniMental State Examination (MMSE) in 2250 patients included in Syst-Eur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive impairment</z:hpo> was defined with a MMSE score &lt; or = 23 and led to further evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline blood pressure (BP) was based on the average of six sitting blood pressure readings at three run-in visits 1 month apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis used Spearman correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The MMSE was analysed in 1374 women and 751 men whose mean age was 70 years (range: 60-100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median level of education expressed as the age at which they stopped their education at school, was 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Baseline blood pressure averaged 173 +/- 10/86 +/- 6 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Before randomisation in the trial, 899 (40%) patients had received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> therapy and 602 (27%) had experienced cardiovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The MMSE-scores ranged from 15 to 30 (median = 29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The maximal score of 30 was reached by 609 (30%) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Among the 59 (3%) patients with a MMSE-score of 23 or less, 5 were considered to be <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> according to the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> IIIR criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The MMSE-scores decreased with advancing age in men (r = -0.16; p &lt; 0.001) and women alike (r = -0.24; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In both men and women, they were positively correlated with the level of education (r = 0.30 and 0.32, respectively; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>They were negatively correlated with systolic blood pressure (r = 0.10; p &lt; 0.001) and slightly positively correlated with diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.05; p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Previously treated patients or patients reporting cardiovascular complications at baseline had lower MMSE-scores than their non-treated counterparts or subjects without cardiovascular complications (median = 28 and 29, respectively, p &lt; 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a European cohort of 2225 patients over 60 years of age with isolated systolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, the level of cognitive functions evaluated with the MMSE decreases with advancing age or lesser educational level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>It also decreases with higher systolic blood pressure or lower diastolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The influence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> therapy on cognitive status will be prospectively evaluated in Syst-Eur Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Project </plain></SENT>
