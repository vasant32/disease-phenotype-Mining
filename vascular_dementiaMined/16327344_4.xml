<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to explore the effects of ethnicity on the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in a large Singaporean sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 357 patients were studied: 190 with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 167 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was more common among Chinese and Malays, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> was more common in Indians and Eurasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Factors that may contribute to the observed ethnic variability in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> etiologies include differential frequency of the ApoE-e4 allele, frequency of vascular risk factors, lifestyle choices, and cultural attitudes toward health care utilization </plain></SENT>
