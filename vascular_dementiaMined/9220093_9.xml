<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They were administered a complex reaction time test, a continuous performance test (<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>), and a neuropsychological battery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared to NE, both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups had significantly slower motor reaction times and made more errors on the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared to AD patients, the VaD patients were slower in stimulus categorization time and had increasing omission errors and persistent commission errors throughout the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> trial, VaD, which usually includes frontal-subcortical circuit injury, can impair mental speed and stimulus response initiation </plain></SENT>
