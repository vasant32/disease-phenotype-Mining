<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, an association between PRNP polymorphisms and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) has not been reported thus far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the PRNP polymorphisms are associated with an increased risk for developing VaD in the Korean population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared the genotype, allele and haplotype frequencies of PRNP polymorphisms in 160 VaD patients with those in 236 healthy Koreans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Codon 129 (M129V) and 219 (Q219K) polymorphisms in Korean VaD patients were found in the open reading frame of PRNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our study shows that there is no significant difference in the genotype, allele and haplotype frequencies of PRNP codon 129 and 219 polymorphisms between Korean VaD patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was the first genetic association study of the polymorphisms of PRNP with VaD </plain></SENT>
