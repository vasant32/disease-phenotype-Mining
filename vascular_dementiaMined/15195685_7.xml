<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analysis included frontal and occipital cortex as a paradigm of motor and sensory cerebrocortical areas respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Values of systolic pressure were slightly higher in 2-month-old SHR compared to age-matched WKY rats and augmented progressively with increasing age in SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In frontal cortex of SHR a decrease of nerve cell number and of cortical volume was observed in layers V and VI of 4- and 6- month-old SHR, and in layers I-IV of 6- month-old SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In occipital cortex a decrease of the number of nerve cells and of cortical volume was observed in layers V and VI of 2-, 4-, 6- month-old SHR, and in layers I-IV of 6-month-old SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Numerical decrease of neurons in SHR affected to a greater extent occipital cortex than frontal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An increase in the number of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactive astrocytes (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>) as well as in the mean immune reaction area (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>) was found in the two cerebrocortical areas investigated of 6-month-old SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> identified using the terminal deoxyribo-nucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-16-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling (TUNEL) technique was also observed in frontal and occipital cortex of 6-month-old SHR, but not of younger cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate the development of microanatomical changes in the cerebral cortex of SHR, the extent of which increases parallel with the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of cerebrocortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> as well as the obvious <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> occurring in established <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> may account for the increased risk of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> that represents a specific trait of complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
