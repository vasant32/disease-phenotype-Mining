<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study aimed at replicating previous findings on BPSD clustering in behavioral sub-syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: One hundred and sixty-six consecutive outpatients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> attending a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> outpatient clinic were enrolled and evaluated with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and the Mini Mental State Examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results: BPSD were reported in 157 patients included in the final sample: 140 patients (89.17%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), while 17 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most frequent BPSD were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in the whole sample and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo> in the AD subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> was predicted by two BPSD in the whole sample (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo> and motor disturbance) and only by nighttime behavior in the AD subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Factor analyses identified 4 factors, accounting for about 60% of variance in the whole group and in the AD subgroup of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: The current study confirmed findings of previous studies on BPSD clustering, regarding the number of BPSD clusters and the total variance explained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study has some limitations, including the small number of non-ADs and its monocentric character </plain></SENT>
