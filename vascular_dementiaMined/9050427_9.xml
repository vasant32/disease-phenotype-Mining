<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The hypothesis being tested was that low doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> would diminish persistent, purposeless vocalizations in two severely <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> geriatric women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A secondary hypothesis was that the severe tardive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100660'>dyskinesia</z:hpo> observed in one patient would improve after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: An intrasubject on-off-on design was employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> care facility in Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Two inpatients with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV (American Psychiatric Association) diagnosis of combined Alzheimer vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASURES: Nursing assessment of frequency of vocalizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Extrapyramidal System Rating Scale (ESRS) and Folstein Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> treatment, the vocalizations diminished to less than 20% of baseline ratings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100660'>dyskinesia</z:hpo>, ESRS dyskinetic movement scores decreased (baseline = 27; after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> 8 weeks = 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No change was observed for the MMSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the main hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The secondary hypothesis was also supported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies of larger numbers of subjects are required to substantiate these preliminary findings </plain></SENT>
