<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One patient was a 29-year-old male who complained of transient <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of the extremities and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computerized tomography (CT) scans showed multiple small infarctions, while cerebral angiography demonstrated findings of Moya-like disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cognitive function tests were subnormal and the study of cerebral blood flow (CBF study) showed diffuse low flow in both hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on his clinical symptoms and CBF study, the STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass was performed on both sides in two stages without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, his clinical symptoms and cognitive function improved gradually, in accordance with increased CBF in both hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six months after the operation, cognitive function tests were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Another patient was a 61-year-old hypertensive male who complained of motor <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, impairment of memory and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CT scans showed multiple small infarctions, while cerebral angiography revealed occlusion of both internal carotid arteries at the cervical portion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cognitive function was at the pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> level, and CBF study revealed diffuse low flow in both hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on the clinical symptoms and CBF study, the STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass was performed on both sides in two stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, clinical symptoms and cognitive function markedly improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>From our results, the diagnosis of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and indications for the use of STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass in this category of patients are discussed </plain></SENT>
