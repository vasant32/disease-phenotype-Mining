<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine what proportion of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> seen by family physicians are assessed and managed according to the recommendations of the Canadian Consensus Conference on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> (CCCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective medical record review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Outpatient services in university-affiliated family practice clinics in Calgary, Alta; Ottawa, Ont; and Toronto, Ont </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: One hundred sixty patients who were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> between January 1, 2000, and June 1, 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Use of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE); collateral history; physical examination maneuvers; initial laboratory tests; diagnostic imaging; caregiver identification, assessment, and referral; driving assessment; specialist referral patterns; and other recommendations of the CCCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average age of patients assessed was 83 years; most patients (66.3%) were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More than half (54.1%) were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More than 25% of patients were not given a specific diagnosis: 13.1% were labeled as "<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>," and 12.5% as "not yet diagnosed." For most patients (69.6%) a collateral history was obtained and a primary caregiver identified (79.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Few physicians, however, assessed caregiver stress (33.1%) or referred caregivers for support (12.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most patients (80.6%) seen by their family physicians for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1392786" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive changes</z:e> underwent at least one MMSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The average score on the first MMSE was 23.5 (of 30) points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most physicians ordered appropriate "basic" blood tests as part of their assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Forty percent of patients had computed tomographic examinations within 3 months of reporting symptoms of cognitive difficulties to their family physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of these, 25% met the criteria for computed tomographic scan as recommended by the guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Only 36.5% were asked about driving status or safety concerns and had this inquiry documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Of those, 15.5% were referred for driving evaluations and 12.5% were reported to the Ministry of Transportation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is fair to good compliance with recommendations of the 1999 CCCD guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>There is, however, little assessment of caregiver coping and referral of caregivers for support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there is little assessment of driver safety and referral for formal driving evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Computed tomographic imaging as part of the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is overused </plain></SENT>
