<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this work were to evaluate the risk of progression from mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo>/no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MMI/ND) to clinically diagnosable AD in a community-based prospective cohort and to establish the risk factors for progression from MMI/ND to AD in the elderly.Methods: Elderly subjects aged over 65 years were selected from the participants in the first Nakayama study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MMI/ND was defined as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficit</z:e> on objective memory assessment, without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, impairment of general cognitive function, or disability in activities of daily living </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 104 MMI/ND subjects selected from 1242 community-dwellers were followed longitudinally for five years.Results: During the five-year follow-up, 11 (10.6%) subjects were diagnosed with AD, five (4.8%) with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), and six (5.8%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of other etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) and a family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (within third-degree relatives) were positively associated with progression to AD, while no factor was significantly associated with progression to VaD or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>.Conclusions: DM and a family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were significant risk factors for progression from MMI/ND to clinically diagnosable AD in the elderly in a Japanese community </plain></SENT>
