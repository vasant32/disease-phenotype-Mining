<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal changes in memory, visuospatial and verbal functioning in a sample of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> persons were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of several demographic, psychometric, and biological indices in predicting the rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e> was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sample consisted of 31 very old (mean age at entry = 83.5 years, range = 75-95) persons with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (n = 22) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n = 9) from a community-based study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were tested on two occasions separated by approximately 2.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results indicated significant longitudinal decline in verbal fluency and visuospatial ability, but only on 1 of 3 measures of episodic memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results from regression analyses indicated that a variety of putatively important variables, including age, gender, education, digit span, as well as a number of biological (<z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi>, TSH), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> etiology, and psychometric (digit span) indicators, exhibited no relationship to rate of memory, visuospatial, or verbal decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is highly variable, and this variability in change appears to include a variety of characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A possible reason thereof may be that the role of individual-difference variables for cognitive functioning in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is overshadowed by the pathogenetic process itself </plain></SENT>
