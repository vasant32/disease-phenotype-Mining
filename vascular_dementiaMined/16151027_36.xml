<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate the relationship between arterial stiffness and cognitive function in a population of elderly subjects reporting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the association between cognitive function and arterial stiffness in 308 consecutive elderly subjects attending a geriatric outpatient clinic reporting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were classified into 4 categories according to neuropsychological evaluation: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognitive function, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD), or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arterial stiffness was evaluated by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurement using Complior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this population, 78+/-8 years of age (women 64%), AD was present in 41%, VaD in 6%, MCI in 27%, and 26% of subjects had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, gender, systolic blood pressure, education level, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> therapy, a significant association was observed between PWV and cognitive status (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PWV appears significantly higher in subjects with VaD (15.2+/-3.9 m/s) or AD (13.3+/-2.9 m/s) than in those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (11.5+/-2.0 m/s; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, PWV was higher in subjects with MCI (12.6+/-2.6 m/s) than in those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (11.5+/-2.0 m/s; P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For each 2 m/s increment in PWV, the adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) was 1.73 (1.27 to 2.47) for AD and 3.52 (1.87 to 8.05) for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed a relationship between arterial stiffness and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, suggesting that functional changes of the arterial system could be involved in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD or AD types) </plain></SENT>
