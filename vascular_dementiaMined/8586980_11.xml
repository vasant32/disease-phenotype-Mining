<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No differences in IL-2 secretion were found between mild AD patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there was a significant increase in IL-2 production both in the moderately-severe AD group and in the VaD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IL-6 levels in AD patients of both groups were similar and significantly higher than those of VaD and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that increased levels of IL-2-production correlate with severity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, whereas increased levels of IL-6 production seem to be related to AD and thus may play a role in AD pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
