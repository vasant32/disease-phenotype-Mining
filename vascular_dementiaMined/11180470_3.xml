<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Blinded evaluations of clock drawing tests and CT studies of elderly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients were conducted by a geriatric psychiatrist and a neuroradiologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Fifty-one community-dwelling elderly subjects meeting the criteria for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (Alzheimer's type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>: N=31; vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>: N=15; "mixed" type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>: N=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG), Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating (CDR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CAMCOG derived scored clock drawings were evaluated using adaptations of Shulman et al.'s and Freedman et al.'s methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CT studies were evaluated using six different linear measurements of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the CT linear measurements, only the Cerebro-Ventricular Index-2 (CVI-2; bicaudate index) significantly correlated with clock drawing ratings (CAMCOG's clock r=-0.407, p=0.003; Shulman's method r=0.357, p=0.01, Freedman's method r=-0.413, p=0.003) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between CVI-2 with demographic (age), cognitive (MMSE, CAMCOG) and clinical (duration of illness, CDR) ratings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Alzheimer's patients generally maintained a significant correlation between CVI-2 and clock drawings, but vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients did not; CVI-2 also correlated significantly with the Praxis subtest of the CAMCOG in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and Alzheimer's patients but not in the vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that only CVI-2 but not the other radiological measures studied, was selected as the significant variable to correlated with clock drawing test ratings in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> group and Alzheimer's patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Partial correlation analysis controlling for demographic and clinical variables shows that controlled variables had no significant effect on the relationship between clock drawing ratings and CVI-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A single and easy to perform measure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002340'>caudate atrophy</z:hpo> correlates specifically and consistently with impairments revealed in the clock drawing test and with a Praxis subtest, suggesting possible caudate involvement with clock drawings in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in general and of the Alzheimer's type in particular </plain></SENT>
