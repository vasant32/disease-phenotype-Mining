<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Propentofylline (HWA 285) has shown beneficial effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these common elements, thus favouring its use in both subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a multinational, randomized, 12-month, double-blind, parallel-group study 260 out-patients with mild to moderate AD or VaD received 300 mg propentofylline (n = 129) or placebo (n = 131) three times daily 1 h before meals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The efficacy was tested at four independent rater levels (physician, psychologist, relative and patient) with assessments covering three major domains of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (global function, cognitive function and activities of daily living) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 12 months, the total patient population showed statistically significant treatment differences in favour of propentofylline for the global measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (Gottfries-Br√•ne-Steen scale, GBS, p = 0.001; Clinical Global Impressions, CGI, item I: p = 0.004, item II: p = 0.072) as well as for the cognitive measures (Syndrome Short Test, SKT, p = 0.002) and Mini-Mental State Examination (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The activities of daily living also showed a significant treatment difference in favour of propentofylline (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant treatment differences were found for rating scales performed by the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At month 12, VaD patients showed treatment differences in favour of propentofylline for the GBS total score (p = 0.006), CGI item I (p = 0.004), GGI item II (p = 0.044) and SKT (p = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment differences for AD patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in favour of propentofylline and reached statistical significance for the SKT (p = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Propentofylline showed a good safety profile with respect to adverse events, vital signs, ECG and laboratory changes </plain></SENT>
