<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A multi-site randomized clinical trial with matched groups, and measurements at baseline and after seven months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Sixteen psychogeriatric wards in fourteen nursing homes in the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and forty-six elderly residents with the diagnosis <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer (DAT) type, mixed DAT and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> syndrome (NAO) and 99 nursing assistants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Integrated emotion-oriented care and usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MESUREMENTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Demented</z:e> elderly: Behaviour and mood related to adaptation to the illness and the institutionalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nursing assistants: General health as measured by feelings of stress, stress reactions, feeling of competence and illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Positive effects in favour of the integrated emotion-oriented care were found in mild to moderately <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> residents on two adaptive tasks: maintaining an emotional balance (less <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>) and preserving a positive self-image (less dissatisfaction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the trained group of nursing assistants fewer stress reactions were found only in those who perceived improvement in their emotion-oriented care skills after training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Emotion-oriented care is more effective with regard to the emotional adaptation in nursing homes of persons with a mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For the severely <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> elderly we did not find this surplus value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This outcome is of clinical importance for elderly persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> who are cared for in nursing homes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>With respect to the nursing assistants it is concluded that emotion-oriented care has a positive influence on stress reactions in some of them </plain></SENT>
