<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A Canadian economic evaluation of propentofylline (a therapy shown to be effective for patients with mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> and/or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) versus standard care was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were categorized by functional abilities according to the Alberta Resident Classification System by translating measures that were originally captured through the Gottfries-Br√•ne-Steen scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Alberta Resident Classification System was then linked to a community dataset of home care costs for a population with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cost and cost-effectiveness analyses were performed from the perspective of the Ministry of Health, the caregiver, and society using an intent-to-treat analysis for propentofylline versus placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results, limited to the 48-week clinical trial duration, indicated that propentofylline improved health outcomes of persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> as statistically significant treatment effects were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, although an incremental cost for the propentofylline intervention was incurred from the Ministry of Health perspective, home care and, to a larger extent, caregiver costs were reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Savings in these areas may have partially offset annual treatment medication costs because a non-statistically significant cost difference was observed from a societal perspective </plain></SENT>
