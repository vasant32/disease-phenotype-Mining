<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present meta-analysis was performed to derive a more precise estimation of the relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The meta-analysis was performed by searching PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 29 studies included 1763 VaD cases and 4534 controls were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed evidence for significant association between ApoE ɛ4 mutation and VaD risk (for ɛ3/ɛ4 vs. ɛ3/ɛ3: OR=1.65, 95% CI=1.40-1.94, p-value&lt;0.00001; for ɛ4/ɛ4 vs. ɛ3/ɛ3: OR=3.17, 95% CI=2.09-4.80, p-value&lt;0.00001; for ɛ4 allele vs. ɛ3 allele: OR=1.72, 95% CI=1.40-2.12, p-value&lt;0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The similar results were obtained in the subgroup analysis based on ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In summary, the present meta-analysis suggests an association between ApoE ɛ4 mutation and increased risk of VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, due to the small sample size in most of the included studies and the selection bias existed in some studies, the results should be interpreted with caution </plain></SENT>
