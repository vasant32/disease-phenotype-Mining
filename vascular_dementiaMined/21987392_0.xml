<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Vascular causes and factors remain the most significant preventable component of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009241" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disorders</z:e> of elderly individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Hachinski Ischemic Score (HIS) is the questionnaire most commonly used for diagnosis of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To consolidate and further validate the HIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The Canadian Study for Health and Aging was used for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was a cohort study conducted in 3 waves in 1991, 1996-1997, and 2001-2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The HIS containing 13 items was subjected to correspondence analysis to identify its optimal scaling of item scores and minimal set of items while maximizing the explainable variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A community-based cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: For this analysis, we used 2968 of 3054 well-characterized and well-diagnosed cases with complete HIS data (86 cases had â‰¥1 item missing) from Canadian Study for Health and Aging phases 2 (1996-1997; n = 2431) and 3 (2001-2002; n = 623) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two optimized HIS versions were identified that classify patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> vs those with nonvascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> as well as or more accurately than the original HIS instrument </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Assuming the HIS instrument measures only a single dimension, correspondence analysis identified the 7 most discriminative HIS items </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Binary scoring (0, 1) of these items led to a 7-item HIS model that classified as well as the original 13-item HIS instrument </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>By merging highly similar HIS items and applying correspondence analysis, a 5-item composite HIS model was created that measures 2 meaningful dimensions of information and classified vascular vs nonvascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> better than the original HIS instrument </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Each HIS version developed has specific advantages and disadvantages in terms of simplicity, scoring, generalizability, and accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Depending on the specific setting, 2 reduced HIS versions consisting of 5 composite-question items or 7 single-question items classify as well as or better than the original HIS instrument </plain></SENT>
