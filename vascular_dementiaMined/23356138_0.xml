<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated serum level of S100B in 11 patients with subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>) and 19 patients with subcortical vascular mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (SVMCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comparable groups were age-matched (79.18 +/- 7.76 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> group, 77.84 +/- 3.83 in SVMCI; P = 0.53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>22 patients were assessed after 1 month therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was shown that the serum S100B level significantly increased--(0.065 +/- 0.020) micro/l (P = 0.0005) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> patients comparing to SVMCI ones - (0.043 +/- 0.010) microg/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>S100B level was significantly correlated with the clinical parameters: MMSE performance (r(s) = -0.61), CDR (r(s) = 0.58), attention task (r(s) = -0.46), <z:hpo ids='HP_0007024'>pseudobulbar syndrome</z:hpo> severity (r(s) = 0.37) and walking alteration (r(s)= 0.37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with reduction of S100B level due to therapy (positive dynamics, n = 12) we registered significant improvement of some clinical parameters: MMSE, attention level, walking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with increasing of S100B level (negative dynamics, n = 10) we didn't registered improvement of any clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We made the conclusion that the serum level of S100B could be used as marker of progression SVMCI into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> and therapy effectiveness </plain></SENT>
