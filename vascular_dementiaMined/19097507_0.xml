<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-five cases of VD patients were randomly divided into acupuncture group (n = 33) and medication group (n = 32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For patients of acupuncture group, Duxil tablets were taken orally, scalp-points Dingzhongxian (MS 5), Ezhongxian (MS 1) and bilateral Dingpangxian I (MS 8) were punctured separately with the filiform needles retained for 10 h, once daily for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients of medication group were asked to take Duxil tablets orally, one tablet/time, twice daily for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Hastgawa <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> scale (HDS) were used to evaluate the patients' abilities of orientation, calculation, immediate and remote memory and speech </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Activity of Daily Living (ADL) Scale was used to evaluate their daily life ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The latency and amplitude of event-related potential P300 of electroencephalograph (EEG) were analyzed before and after the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After the treatment, of the 33 and 32 cases in acupuncture and medication groups, the controlled, markedly effective, effective and ineffective cases were 2 and 1, 9 and 4, 18 and 16, 4 and 11, respectively; with the total effective rates being 87.88% and 68.75% separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The total effective rate of acupuncture group was obviously higher than that of medication group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Self-comparison showed that MMSE and HDS scores of both acupuncture and medication groups increased significantly in comparison with their individual pre-treatment values (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01), while ADL of both groups decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Before treatment, compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> people, the latencies of P300 in two groups increased significantly (P &lt; 0.01), while the amplitudes of two groups decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After the treatment, the situations of two groups were corrected apparently (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The effects of acupuncture group were significantly superior to those of medication group in MMSE, HDS and ADL scores and the latency of P300 (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Long-term retention of scalp acupuncture needles can improve VD patients' intelligence, ADL ability and EEG </plain></SENT>
