<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recently devised test of motor cortex excitability, the short latency afferent inhibition (SAI), has been proven to depend upon the activity of cholinergic circuits in the human brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate, in vivo, the functional role of the cholinergic system in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> associated with VD, we used this test in 20 patients with subcortical ischemic VD (SIVD) and in 25 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean SAI was significantly reduced in the SIVD patients; however, individual data varied widely, with SAI responses ranging from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> to markedly reduced values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings provide physiological evidence for an important role for cholinergic mechanisms in the pathogenesis of VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The evaluation of SAI, similar to that described in AD patients, could help in identifying those patients who are more likely to respond to treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38323">cholinergic drugs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
