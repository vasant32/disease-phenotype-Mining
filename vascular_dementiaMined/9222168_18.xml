<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Multiethnic population-based studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are lacking in the literature; therefore, we conducted a study to determine the incidence and prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> among, black, white, and Hispanic municipal retirees age 50 and older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 1991, city of Houston municipal workers who retired between 1980 and 1984 received in-home screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> using the Mini-Mental State Examination and were referred for comprehensive neurologic evaluation if indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Families of deceased retirees were interviewed, medical records were reviewed, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates were obtained to determine case status of the retiree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Study participation was 90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Crude prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, among retirees age 60 and older, was 2.65 per 100 population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age-adjusted to the 1970 US population, age 60 to 80, the prevalence was 1.85 per 100 population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age-adjusted prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was similar among Hispanic and black men, 4.75 and 4.80 respectively, and lowest among white men, 2.42 per 100 population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-three percent of the prevalent cases (30% of the incidence cases) were not previously diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> calculated to age 80 was 39% for Hispanic men, 28% for black men, and 14% for white men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five percent of the incidence cases were diagnosed as having ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (IVD), 20% as having probable or possible Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD), and 25% as having unspecified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> by age 80 was more pronounced for Hispanic and black men compared with white men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IVD was the predominant cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> among both black and white men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Grouping Hispanics with whites may mask differences when studying <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
