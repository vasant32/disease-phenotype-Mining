<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, limited research has evaluated patterns (across specific timed intervals) of performance on tasks of language fluency in different forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The current study investigated semantic fluency in 488 elderly individuals (249 with Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 97 Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 97 Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive Impairment</z:hpo> and 45 cognitively intact) across 15-second intervals in an animal naming task using retrospective chart review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> controls produced significantly more exemplars and AD patients produced fewer animal names than the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the first 15- second time interval, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> groups produced significantly fewer exemplars than the non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the end of 30 seconds it was possible to differentiate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aging from MCI who no longer differed from the VaD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, it appears that the greatest and most clinically meaningful differences between the diagnostic groups were detected in the first three 15-second intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present findings support the use of time intervals and total scores on tasks of verbal fluency in clinical settings and for research purposes </plain></SENT>
