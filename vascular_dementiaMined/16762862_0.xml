<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were randomized into 2 groups, and the patients in the control group received the treatment with needling in the routine acupoints for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> (chosen from 6 Yang meridians of the hand and foot), while those in treatment group received needling at 3 additional acupoints, namely Baihui(DU20), Shuigou(DU26) and Shenmen(HT7), which were specific for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were examined by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi>-emission tomography(PET) to detect the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in different brain regions before and after acupuncture treatment by means of semiquantitative analysis of the average values of radioactive count in the brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Needling at the additional 3 acupoints could obviously enhance <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in the bilateral frontal lobes, bilateral thalamus, temporal lobe and lentiform nucleus on the uncompromised side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The effect of needling at Baihui(DU20), Shuigou(DU26) and Shenmen(HT7) on vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is closely related to improved cerebral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
