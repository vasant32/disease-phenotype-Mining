<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>8,199 randomly-sampled Koreans aged 65 years or older were invited to participate in the Phase I screening assessment using Mini-Mental State Examination by door-to-door home visit, and 6,141 subjects (response rate = 74.9%) responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among them, 2,336 subjects were invited to participate in the Phase II diagnostic assessment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and MCI, and 1,673 subjects responded (response rate = 71.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic assessments were administered using the Korean version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Assessment Packet (CERAD-K) Clinical Assessment Battery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CERAD-K Neuropsychological Assessment Battery was used for diagnosing MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age-, gender-, education-, and urbanicity-standardized prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was estimated to be 8.1% (95% CI = 6.9-9.2) for overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 24.1% (95% CI = 21.0-27.2) for MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) was the most prevalent type (5.7%) followed by vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (2.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Amnestic subtype (20.1%) was much more prevalent than nonamnestic subtype in MCI (4.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Older age, being male, lower education level, illiteracy, smoking, and histories of head trauma or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> were associated with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> risk, and alcohol use and moderately intense exercise were associated with decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We expect numbers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients to double every 20 years until 2050 in Korea and expect AD to account for progressively more <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases in the future </plain></SENT>
