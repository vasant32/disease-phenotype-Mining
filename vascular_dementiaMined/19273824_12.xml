<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency, clinical, neuropsychological, and imaging correlates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo> were assessed in a large cohort of patients with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> with subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo>, a genetic model of SIVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>Apathy</z:hpo> was diagnosed based on Neuropsychiatric Inventory assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Degree of disability was assessed by modified Rankin scale, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> by Mattis <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating Scale (MDRS) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), autonomy by the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale, and quality of life by SEP-59 self-questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Validated imaging methods were used to determine the total burden of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 132 patients, 54 (41%) were apathetic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Apathetic patients were older than nonapathetic subjects, had a lower MMSE and MDRS score, had more global disability, and were more limited in IADL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Apathetic patients were more frequently depressed compared to nonapathetic patients and more frequently presented additional neuropsychiatric symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression modeling showed a significant and independent association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo> and a lower score of overall quality of life and between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo> and a higher load of white matter and lacunar lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo> is common in cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> with subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> (CADASIL), appears in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, global functional disability, and severe neuropsychiatric symptoms during the course of the disease, and can occur separately from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>Apathy</z:hpo> has an independent impact on the overall quality of life in CADASIL </plain></SENT>
