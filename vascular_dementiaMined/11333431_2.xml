<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the appropriateness of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10 criterion for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> which requires unequal distribution of deficits between different domains of cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional comparative study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Referrals to a specialist memory clinic in Sheffield and a community sample of patients from a general practice population in Melton Mowbray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The CAMCOG part of the Cambridge <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mental disorders</z:e> of the elderly examination (CAMDEX) was assessed for 131 Sheffield subjects and 396 Melton Mowbray subjects to examine both total variability and differences between individual subscale items </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> was also examined as this was a potential confounding factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for age, sex and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scores, there were no significant differences between vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subjects and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> subjects at either centre for total variability of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> and little difference between diagnoses for individual subscale items </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Sheffield, subjects with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> had significantly higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scores compared to those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The usefulness of the concept of unequal deficits as a diagnostic criterion for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in routine clinical practice is doubtful </plain></SENT>
