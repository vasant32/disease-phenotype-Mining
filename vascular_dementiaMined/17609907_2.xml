<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty patients with VD were randomized into 5 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Needling on conventionally used acupoints of hand and foot three Yang-meridians aiming at <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> was applied to the patients in Group A, and needling on DU20 to Group B, on DU26 to Group C, on HT7 to Group D and on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the three to Group E was applied additionally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Assessments of Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Family Attitude Questionnaire (FAQ) were made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>And the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission computerized tomography (PET) and single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computerized tomography (SPECT) examinations were conducted in 5 selected patients from each group before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Needling on conventional acupoints plus DU20 could effect the inner temporal system, thalamencephalon system and prefrontal cortical system to improve memory and executive capacity of VD patients; conventional acupoints plus DU26 could effect more to the prefrontal cortical system to obviously elevate the executive capacity; that plus HT7 would reveal an effect similar to but rather weaker than plus DU20, and effect more to memory; and that plus <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the three simultaneously could effect rather roundly multiple aspects of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system related to intellectual activities, to elevate the recognition and enhance the executive capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Needling on various acupoints like DU20, DU26 and HT7 have effects on different brain areas </plain></SENT>
