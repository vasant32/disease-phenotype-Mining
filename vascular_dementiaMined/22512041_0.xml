<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>VD rats model was replicated by permanent bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (2VO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The learning and memory capability of VD rats was evaluated by <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and the content of glutamic acid (Glu) and malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) in hippocampus of VD rats' brain were determined, separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> could alleviate learning and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> of VD rats significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">Ferulic acid</z:chebi> was found to inhibit the activity of AChE and increased the activity of SOD in rat hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> could also decrease the content of Glu and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> in rat hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> could alleviate VD rats' learning and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e>, which might be due to antioxidation, the improvement of cholinergic system in brain, or the inhibitory of nerve injury by excitatory amino acids </plain></SENT>
