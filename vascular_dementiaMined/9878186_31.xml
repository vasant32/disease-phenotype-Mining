<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the multifunctional protein clusterin (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> J, SGP-2, SP-40,40) in brain tissue using quantitative Western blotting and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The material included postmortem brains from 19 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), 6 with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VAD), and 7 age-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intense clusterin staining was found in the soma of both neuronal and astroglial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, positive staining was found in a portion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>senile plaques</z:hpo> (SP) in AD brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative analysis showed that clusterin levels were significantly increased in AD, both in frontal cortex (150% of the control value, P = 0.002) and in the hippocampus (179% of the control value, P &lt; 0.001), while <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> clusterin levels were found in cerebellum (104% of the control value) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant changes were found in VAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within the AD group, there was a significant negative correlation between clusterin levels in hippocampus and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (r = -0.40), while no such correlation was found in frontal cortex (r = 0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant correlations were found between clusterin levels and the number of SP or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in clusterin levels were found in any brain region between AD patients possessing different numbers of the ApoE4 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The increased clusterin levels in AD brain, together with the absence of a correlation between SP counts and clusterin levels, and the finding that clusterin is only found in a smaller portion of SP do not suggest a link between clusterin and beta-amyloid dependence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Instead we hypothesize that the increase is part of a regional response in AD brain </plain></SENT>
