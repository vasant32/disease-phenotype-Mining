<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> has also become recognized as a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the possible effect of the APOE genotype on the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is unexamined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the independent and combined effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and APOE epsilon4 on the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and its subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The Honolulu-Asia Aging Study, a population-based prospective cohort study of Japanese American men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Depressive symptoms and presence of the APOE epsilon4 allele were assessed between March 1991 and October 1993 in 1932 cognitively healthy men aged 71 to 90 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incident cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were diagnosed during approximately 6 years of follow-up based on neurologic assessment at 2 repeated examinations (April 1994-April 1996 and October 1997-February 1999) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The interaction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and APOE epsilon4 was statistically significant in the analytical models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with men with neither APOE epsilon4 nor <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in nondepressed men with APOE epsilon4 was not significant (hazard ratio, 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6-1.8); however, depressed men without APOE epsilon4 had a 1.6-fold greater risk (95% CI, 0.8-3.0), whereas depressed men with APOE epsilon4 had a 7.1-fold greater risk (95% CI, 3.0-16.7) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For subtypes, we found similar increased risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The APOE epsilon4 status modifies the association between depressive symptoms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in elderly men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because individuals with depressive symptoms and the APOE epsilon4 allele had a markedly increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, one might be especially watchful for early signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the older person with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> who is also positive for the APOE epsilon4 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Because this cohort includes only men, further investigation in women is required </plain></SENT>
