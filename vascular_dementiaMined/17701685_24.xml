<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) measurements (ABPM) correlate more closely with target organ damage and cardiovascular events than clinical cuff measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ABPM reveals the significant circadian variation in BP, which in most individuals presents a morning increase, small post-prandial decline, and more extensive lowering during nocturnal rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, under certain pathophysiological conditions, the nocturnal BP decline may be reduced (non-dipper pattern) or even reversed (riser pattern) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is clinically relevant because the non-dipper and riser circadian BP patterns constitute a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, cerebrovascular disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hence, there is growing interest in how to best tailor and individualize the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> according to the specific circadian BP pattern of each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> previous trials that have demonstrated an increased cardiovascular risk in non-dipper as compared to dipper patients have relied on the prognostic significance of a single ABPM baseline profile from each participant without accounting for possible changes in the BP pattern during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the potential benefit (i.e., reduction in cardiovascular risk) associated with the normalization of the circadian BP variability (conversion from non-dipper to dipper pattern) from an appropriately envisioned treatment strategy is still a matter of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the MAPEC (Monitorización Ambulatoria de la Presión Arterial y Eventos Cardiovasculares, i.e., Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring and Cardiovascular Events) study was designed to investigate whether the normalization of the circadian BP profile toward more of a dipper pattern by chronotherapeutic strategies (i.e., specific timing during the 24 h of BP-lowering medications according to the 24 h BP pattern) reduces cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prospective MAPEC study investigates 3,000 diurnally active men and women &gt;/=18 yrs of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At inclusion, BP and wrist activity are measured for 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The initial evaluation also includes a detailed medical history, an electrocardiogram, and screening laboratory blood and urine tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The same evaluation procedure is scheduled yearly or more frequently (quarterly) if treatment adjustment is required for BP control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> and mortality are thus evaluated on the basis of changes in BP during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The MAPEC study, now on its fourth year of follow-up, investigates the potential decrease in cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal risk from the proper modeling of the circadian BP profile by the timed administration (chronotherapy) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medication, beyond the reduction of clinic-determined daytime or ABPM-determined 24 h mean BP levels </plain></SENT>
