<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on the amyloid cascade theory, many reports indicated that immunotherapy is effective for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We developed a mucosal immunotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> via oral vaccine with recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector and nasal administration of recombinant sendaivirus vector expressing Al 1-43/IL-10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oral or nasal administration of recombinant virus vector induced the long-term expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> in the epithelial cells and presented the Ap antigen to the mucosal immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antibody levels in the mouse serum were elevated after 4 weeks and the antibody inhibited the aggregation of Ap in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry of the APP transgenic mouse brain tissue showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> burdens were markedly decreased in the treated mouse compared to the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was not recognized in any organ including brain and kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mucosal immunotherapy with <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> vectors significantly cleared the Ap depositions without <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and reduced the levels of Al in the brain homogenates of APP transgenic mice; therefore, it might be effective for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
