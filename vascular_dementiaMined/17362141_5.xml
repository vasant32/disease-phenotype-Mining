<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Participants were healthy adults and patients diagnosed with probable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological test records, which included the HVLT-R, were collected from an archival database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ratio semantic clustering (RSC) scores were calculated for each HVLT-R recall trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Factor analysis including RSC and other HVLT-R scores yielded high loadings of RSC scores on a distinct clustering factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group comparisons showed that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls had higher HVLT-R recall and RSC scores than DAT and VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only the DAT group showed significant decline in RSC from the final learning trial to delayed recall, and only the DAT group performed more poorly than controls on other semantic processing measures (e.g., HVLT-R semantically-related false positives, Boston Naming Test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that these newly developed semantic clustering indexes are easily calculated and potentially useful for discriminating between elder controls and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
