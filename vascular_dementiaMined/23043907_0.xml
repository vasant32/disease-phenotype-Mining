<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These age-related changes may cause some <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and frontally accentuated diffuse decrease in metabolism </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The differential diagnosis of these disorders is based on symptoms of cognitive and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> and is supported by results of neuropsychological tests and of imaging </plain></SENT>
