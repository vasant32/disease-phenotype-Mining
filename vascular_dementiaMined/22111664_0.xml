<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A genome-wide association study (GWAS) failed to detect any genetic associations with susceptibility to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) by the Bonferroni multiple test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to discover false negative associations from the GWAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We selected a candidate gene in which multiple associations were identified with its single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genetic associations were intensively examined with its SNPs using 207 VaD patients and 207 age- and sex-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functions of candidate SNPs on splicing of the gene were predicted by an in silico analysis and evaluated by a minigene assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Genetic analysis with 80 SNPs of pleckstrin homology like domain beta 2 (PHLDB2) revealed 6 SNPs associated with VaD (P &lt; 6.25 Ã— 10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among them, four SNPs in introns 2 and 3 were in complete linkage and associated also with VaD-related phenotypes (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Especially, rs951660 was predicted to produce splicing enhancers or serine/arginine-rich protein binding sites, and its minor allele (A) delayed expression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The current study suggested a novel association of susceptibility to VaD with the gene encoding PHLDB2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The minor allele, A, of its intronic SNP 'rs951660' might induce a delayed splicing and thus increase the susceptibility to VaD </plain></SENT>
