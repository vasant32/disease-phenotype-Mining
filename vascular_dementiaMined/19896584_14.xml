<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight mildly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients with SIVD (mean +/- SD; aged 77 +/- 8 years; Mini-Mental State Examination score 26 +/- 3 years) and 14 patients with AD were compared with 18 cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects had CBF measured using arterial spin-labeling magnetic resonance imaging, and brain volumes were assessed using structural magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AD and SIVD showed marked CBF reductions in the frontal (P = 0.001) and parietal (P = 0.001) cortices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In SIVD, increased subcortical WMLs were associated with reduced CBF in the frontal cortex (P = 0.04), in addition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> (frontal, P = 0.05; parietal, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Subcortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> is associated with reduced CBF in the cortex, irrespective of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
