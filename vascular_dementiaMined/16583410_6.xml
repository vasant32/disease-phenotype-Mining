<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A case-control study was performed to identify single nucleotide variants of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene associated with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven SNPs in promoter, 5'-UTR, 3'-UTR, and introns of VEGF gene were identified in 24 Koreans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three of them, -1154G/A, -7C/T, and 13553C/T, were selected based on allele frequency and linkage disequilibrium (LD), and genotyped in 207 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients and 207 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant association with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was not shown (P &gt; 0.05) in the alleles and genotypes of single locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequent analysis of composing VEGF risk haplotypes associated with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was performed with maximum likelihood estimates of their possible haplotypes employing the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of three-locus haplotypes, only GTC was significantly associated with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, conferring a risk of 1.87 (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of two-locus haplotypes, the risk was observed with the nested forms of the risk haplotype GTC, that is, GT at the loci -1154G/A and -7C/T and TC at the loci -7C/T and 13553C/T (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggested some interaction among -1154G/A, -7C/T, and 13553C/T variants in the determination of risk for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
