<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: APOE allele and genotype frequencies were determined by PCR in 89 patients with possible and probable VaD and compared with those in 97 patients with possible and probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) of similar age of disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and ethnic background, and with 766 control subjects drawn from the same geographical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The APOE epsilon4 allele frequency in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 97 patients with possible and probable AD was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) than that in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the APOE epsilon4 allele frequency in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 89 patients with possible and probable VaD was also significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) than that in control subjects, but not significantly different from that in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The APOE epsilon4 allele frequency was similarly, and still significantly (p &lt; 0.001), increased when only those patients with probable AD or probable VaD were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Possession of APOE epsilon4 allele increases the risk of VaD </plain></SENT>
