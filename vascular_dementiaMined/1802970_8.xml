<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study tested aspects of a novel etiological/pathogenetic hypothesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), which proposes that alterations in <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> regulation of peripheral calcium/phosphate (Ca/PO4) homeostasis (e.g., by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>, etc.) induce and/or reflect altered calcium homeostasis and neurotoxicity in brain neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two key predictions of this hypothesis were tested, namely that: (1) alterations in serum Ca and/or PO4 regulation should be present before or near the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of AD and (2) these alterations should be found consistently in subjects with unconfounded AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have sought evidence of changes in Ca regulation primarily late in the disease, and usually in severely <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e>, thin and immobile inpatients in whom Ca/PO4 measures are likely to be confounded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, only mobile, relatively healthy, adequately nourished outpatients with probable AD were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In comparison to age-matched controls or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> subjects with even mild indications of vascular contributions, the AD subjects were characterized by lower serum PO4 and, to a lesser degree, lower serum Ca as well as a higher <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>/PO4 ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On serum chemistry tests from the first stages of AD (within 1 or 3 years after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of cognitive symptoms), these changes in serum PO4/Ca were as pronounced as they were later in the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moderately low values of either PO4, Ca, or both (below -1.0 S.D. from the control group mean) identified 74% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> AD subjects and 100% of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AD subjects, in comparison to only 46% of mixed/vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subjects and 31% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the results were consistent with the predictions and may have significant etiological/pathogenetic implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If larger tests confirm these frequencies, serum Ca/PO4 indices may also prove useful in differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
