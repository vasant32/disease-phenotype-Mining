<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify the associations of ApoE polymorphism with AD, VD and ICVD in Japanese, we examined ApoE polymorphism in samples of 255 patients with AD, 87 patients with VD, and 123 patients with ICVD, as compared with 117 age-matched healthy control subjects (CTL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the ApoE sigma4 allele was significantly higher in the VD group (0.21), the ICVD group (0.15) as well as in the AD group (0 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the genotype of ApoE sigma4 is associated with not only AD but also VD and ICVD, and that ApoE sigma4 plays an important role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and ICVD </plain></SENT>
