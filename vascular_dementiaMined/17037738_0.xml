<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats of experimental group were treated with a permanent bilateral common carotid arteries (CCA) occlusion (2-VO) for establishing vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were evaluated on learning-memory ability by Y-type water maze test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dynamic expression of HIF-1alpha and EPO in hippocampal CA1 region were measured by immunohistochemical assay method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) The learning-memory ability of rats in VD groups was progressively decreased as the ischemic duration prolonged (P &lt; 0.05); (2) In VD group, the expression of HIF-1alpha and EPO in hippocampal CA1 region were most obvious at 1 w, and then declined progressively but still above the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level (P &lt; 0.01); (3) In VD group, the expression of HIF-1alpha and EPO at each ischemic point and their corresponding learning-memory ability were in significant correlation at the 0.01 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Both HIF-1alpha and EPO contribute to the formation of VD, and HIF-1/EPO anoxic signal transduction may play a protecting role in this process </plain></SENT>
