<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of structures in the medial temporal lobe has been considered an indication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), atrophic changes on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images have also been associated with other dementing diseases and are not specific to AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to determine whether characteristic alterations in the hippocampus of patients with AD are detectable with magnetization transfer (MT) imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Coronal MT imaging was performed in 35 patients with probable AD, in 14 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, in 13 patients with other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and in 23 control subjects to measure MT ratios of the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medial temporal lobe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was graded subjectively on a five-point scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Scores of medial temporal lobe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups were significantly higher than those in control subjects, but no differences were found among the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MT ratios in the hippocampus were significantly lower in patients with AD than in those with non-AD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and in the control subjects; however, no differences were found between the non-AD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients and the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MT ratio measurements were better than visual analysis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> for differentiating AD patients from those with non-AD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (an overall discrimination rate of 77% versus 65%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MT ratios significantly correlated with scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination and with medial temporal lobe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in AD patients but not in patients with non-AD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MT measurements may be more specific than visual analysis in detecting structural damage of the hippocampus in AD patients and might be useful in discriminating AD from vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
