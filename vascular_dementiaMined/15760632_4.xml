<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37733">cholinesterase inhibitor</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi>, is clinically effective in both AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results from a 10-study metaanalysis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> (5 or 10 mg/day) in AD and a two-study combined analysis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> (5 or 10 mg/day) in VaD are presented to compare patient characteristics and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> treatment outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analyzed studies were randomized, placebo-controlled, and of up to 24 weeks duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both AD and VaD, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> provided significant benefits compared with placebo on measures of cognition and global function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Placebo-treated AD patients showed a decline in cognition and global function, whereas placebo-treated VaD patients remained stable, suggesting treatment effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> in VaD were driven by improvement rather than stabilization or reduced decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More VaD patients than AD patients received concomitant medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular adverse events were more common in VaD than AD patients but were not increased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, although there are differences between AD and VaD patients in comorbid conditions and concomitant medications, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> is effective and well tolerated in both types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
