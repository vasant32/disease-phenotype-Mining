<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine relative contributions of first-degree familial and individual risk factors to clinical manifestations of two major age-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors interviewed 183 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) and 137 patients with ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (IVD) together with family members and caregivers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Information was also obtained from medical records and collateral sources as required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Risk factor data within a predictive model for differentiating the two <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a greater incidence of family history of degenerative and dementing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurologic disorders</z:e> in DAT than in IVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both groups were equivalent for family histories of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite familial equivalence, patients with IVD had a greater individual incidence of risk factors for cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis by gender revealed three observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among DAT patients, family history for degenerative and dementing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurologic disorders</z:e> proved to be significantly greater among women than among men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This risk factor did not, however, predict individual diagnoses for DAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Women with IVD were more likely to have a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> than men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analyses revealed that reduced educational levels in women predicted greater liability for IVD than for DAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> risk factors for IVD, but not for DAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Individual and familial historical data provide useful information concerning identification, pathogenesis, prevention, and treatments for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> but little predictive information for identifying patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
