<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that patients with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> have higher levels of circulating brain-derived <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">24S-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">cerebrosterol</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two recent epidemiological studies indicated that treatment with inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>) reduces the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that treatment with high-dosage <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> reduces circulating levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">24S-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, 24-week treatment trial for lowering of cholesterol levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conducted assessments at baseline, week 6, and week 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: An academic outpatient clinical study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Eighteen patients who met the criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Treatment with 80 mg/d of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> at night </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> levels were measured enzymatically; lathosterol, by means of gas chromatography; and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">24S-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi>, by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> reduced total plasma cholesterol levels by 36% and 35% after 6 and 24 weeks, respectively (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lathosterol levels were reduced by 74% and 72%, respectively, and the ratio of lathosterol to cholesterol, an indicator of whole-body cholesterol synthesis, was reduced by 60% and 61%, respectively (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">24S-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi> levels were lowered by 45% and 53%, respectively (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The ratio of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">24S-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi> to cholesterol also decreased significantly (-12% [P=.01] and -23% [P&lt;.002], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The further reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">24S-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi> levels and its ratio to cholesterol from weeks 6 to 24 was also significant (P=.02 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The greater reduction of plasma concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">24S-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi> compared with cholesterol indicates that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> in a dosage of 80 mg/d reduces cholesterol turnover in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The present results might describe a possible mechanism of how long-term treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> could reduce the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
