<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 108 VaD patients were randomly divided into two groups: scalp-acupuncture group and Western medicine group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The scores of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Blesse <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Scale (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BDS</z:e>), Hasegawa <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Scale (HDS), Abilities of Daily Life (ADL) before and after treatment in the two groups were detected </plain></SENT>
