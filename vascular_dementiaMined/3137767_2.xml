<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 16 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), 28 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), their age-matched controls and multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS) patients in order to evaluate the humoral immune response within the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system both quantitatively and qualitatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intra-blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) protein synthesis was calculated by CSF IgG index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of oligoclonal banding (OCB) was investigated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> isoelectric focusing (IEF) followed by immunoblotting with antihuman IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No patient with AD and only 4 patients with VD had slightly elevated IgG indexes, and no statistically significant differences in the indexes were found between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No bands were found in the CSF of AD patients but 3 VD patients had OCB in both serum and CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One VD patient had bands in serum but no bands in CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No kappa or lambda free light chains were found in those <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients with demonstrable bands in the CSF and serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No OCB were found in control sera and CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For comparison, the majority of patients with MS had OCB in CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, no consistent increase of intrathecal protein synthesis was found in patients with AD and VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Methodological differences explain at least part of the conflicting results published earlier </plain></SENT>
