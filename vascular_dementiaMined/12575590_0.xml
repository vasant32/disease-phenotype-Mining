<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To probe into the effect of Huancongdan capsule (HCDC) on the vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) related factors, including <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (apo) and serum immunoglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-two patients of VD were divided into the HCDC group (27 patients, treated with HCDC) and the control group (25 patients, treated with Naofukang) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Changes of related parameters were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The effects in lowering <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and total cholesterol and elevating <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> in the HCDC group were superior to those in the control group (P &lt; 0.01 or P &lt; 0.05), but the effect in lowering <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> was similar in the two groups (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with data before treatment, in the HCDC group after treatment, the levels of serum apoA1 increased, and serum apoB100, IgA, IgG and circulating immune complex decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.05 or P &lt; 0.01), but the change of apoE level was insignificant (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Through adjusting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism, HCDC could improve blood rheologic characteristics, promote cerebral blood flow, improve the oxygen carrying capacity of blood to prevent and treat VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One of its mechanisms is increasing apoA1 and decreasing apoB100 levels, preventing and improving <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and reducing damage of vascular endothelial cells, the another may be its action in improving immune function </plain></SENT>
