<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A prospective longitudinal clinical work-up with postmortem NP examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> referred for clinical evaluation and follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The diagnostic scores in a set of three short clinical rating scales for AD, FTD, and VaD were evaluated against NP diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of the AD scale were 0.80 and 0.87, respectively, of the FTD scale 0.93 and 0.92, respectively, and of the Hachinski Ischemic Score (HIS, VaD diagnosis) 0.69 and 0.92, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases with mixed AD/VaD generally presented a combination of high AD and ischemic scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A preferred cutoff score of six was identified for both the AD and FTD scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three clinical rating scales showed a high sensitivity and specificity, in close agreement with final NP diagnosis-for the HIS a moderate sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These scales may thus be considered good diagnostic tools and are recommended for clinical and research center settings </plain></SENT>
