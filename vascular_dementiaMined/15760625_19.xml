<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Sydney Older Persons Study examined 6-year outcomes of 630 community-dwelling participants aged 75 or over at recruitment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At baseline, participants were defined as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e>, cognitively intact or having a syndrome possibly representing the preclinical phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, an extrapyramidal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or various combinations of the three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in combination with gait and motor slowing were the most likely to dement over the 6-year period (OR 5.6; 95% CI 2.5-12.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This group was also the most likely to die (OR 3.3; 95% CI 1.6-6.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>White matter indices on MRI scanning were not consistently correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Simple measures of gait may provide useful clinical tools, assisting in the prediction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
