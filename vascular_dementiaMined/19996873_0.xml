<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty AD the National Institute of Neurological and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009460" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Communicative Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) and 30 VaD the state of California <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Diagnostic and Treatment Centers (ADDTC) patients and 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (NC) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Everyday activities in the community were assessed with the Social Activities Questionnaire (SAQ), and tool uses were evaluated with the single-tool and the multiple-tool sequence tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The SAQ scores of the AD and VaD groups were significantly lower than that of the NC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the single tool tasks, the AD and VaD groups exhibited lower scores than the NC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sequence score of the VaD group was lower than that of the AD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The multiple regression analysis disclosed that the SAQ of the AD group was explained by the Mini-Mental State Examination and sequence scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, that of the VaD group was mainly explained by the sequence scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Disturbances in everyday life activities of AD are associated with general <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and sequence disabilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By contrast, those of VaD may be based only on sequence disabilities </plain></SENT>
