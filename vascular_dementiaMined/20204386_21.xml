<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A retrospective hospital-based study of the relative prevalence of different disorders was performed in 1,110 consecutive autopsy cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> elderly in Vienna, Austria (66% females, MMSE &lt;20; mean age 83.3 +/- 5.4 SD years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It assessed clinical, general autopsy data and neuropathology including immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuropathologic diagnosis followed current consensus criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four age groups (7-10th decade) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the total cohort AD pathology was seen in 82.9% ("pure" AD 42.9%; AD + other pathologies 39.9%), VD in 10.8% (mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, MIX, i.e. AD + vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> in 5.5%); other disorders in 5.7%, and negative pathology in 0.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relative prevalence of AD increased from age 60 to 89 years and decreased slightly after age 90+, while "pure" VD diagnosed in the presence of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> of different types with low neuritic AD pathology (Braak stages &lt;3; mean 1.2-1.6) decreased progressively from age 60 to 90+; 85-95% of these patients had histories of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, morphologic signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, 65% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018802" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CHF|chf">cardiac decompensation</z:e>, and 75% a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Morphologic subtypes, subcortical arteriosclerotic (the most frequent), multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo>, and strategic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> showed no age-related differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relative prevalence of AD + Lewy pathology remained fairly constant with increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and AD with minor cerebrovascular lesions increased significantly with age, while other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study using strict morphologic criteria confirmed increased prevalence of AD with age, but mild decline at age 90+, and progressive decline of VD, while AD + vascular pathologies including MIX showed considerable age-related increase, confirming that mixed pathologies account for most <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases in very old persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A prospective clinicopathologic study in oldest-old subjects showed a significant increase in both AD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> (CAA), but decrease in VD over age 85, while in a small group of old subjects CAA without considerable AD pathology may be an independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
