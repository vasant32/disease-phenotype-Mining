<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants consisted of 86 patients with SVaD who fulfilled the criteria proposed by Erkinjuntti et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MBs occurred in 73 of 86 (84.9%) patients with SVaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MBs were most commonly distributed in the cortex, and the cortical MBs were most pronounced in the temporoparietal area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A multiple regression showed that the number of cerebral MB was an independent predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in multiple domains and the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> even after controlling confounding factors such as age, education, ischemic severity, and number of lacunes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that cerebral MB is one of the important factors that cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> in SVaD </plain></SENT>
