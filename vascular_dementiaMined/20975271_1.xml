<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 260 subjects with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) were included in the study and 209 (79%) were followed up after 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At baseline, the subjects were assessed with a neuropsychological battery covering the cognitive domains speed/attention, memory, visuospatial, language and executive functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 2 years, 9 subjects were considered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, 148 had stationary MCI and 47 (23%) had converted to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty subjects were diagnosed with AD, 15 with MD and 9 with VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The others were 2 with unspecified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> and 1 with primary progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> converters had a high proportion of impairment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cognitive domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The profiles of incipient AD and MD/VaD differed, with memory, visuospatial and language symptoms preceding AD, and executive and speed/attention symptoms preceding MD/VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk of converting to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is increased when domains in addition to memory are impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incipient AD and MD/VaD profiles differed quite clearly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Considering that the vascular group consisted of a majority of patients with MD, the differences are convincing - <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> seems to have an essential impact on cognition </plain></SENT>
