<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is higher than in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The other consistent biochemical finding is an increase of lysine in blood and cerebrospinal fluid, but lysine loading does not increase L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid concentration in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This autosomal recessively <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inherited disease</z:e> is expressed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002073'>progressive ataxia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental deficiency</z:hpo> with subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001272'>cerebellar atrophy</z:hpo> on magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since these features were described in 8 patients by Barth and co-workers in 1992, 4 more patients with similar findings have been diagnosed and added to the present series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>L-2-Hydroxyglutaric acid is found in only trace amounts on routine gas chromatographic screening in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> persons, and its origin, its fate and even its relevance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> metabolism are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore its catabolism was studied in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Incubation of rat liver with L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid did not produce <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi>, which excluded (peroxisomal) L-2-hydroxyacid oxidase as the main route of catabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid is rapidly dehydrogenated if <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi>+ is added as a co-factor to the standard reaction medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This could also be demonstrated in human liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The preliminary evidence for this enzyme activity in rats and humans, L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid dehydrogenase, is given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further investigations are required to clarify the possible relevance to the metabolic defect in L-2-hydroxyglutaric acidaemia </plain></SENT>
