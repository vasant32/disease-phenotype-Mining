<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: H-MRS in posterior portion cingulate gyrus was conducted in gender, age, and educational background-matched 24 patients with AD, 8 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), and 11 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (NC group) to measure the values of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> (N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi>)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17268">myo-inositol</z:chebi> (mI), and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> and phosphocreatine (Cr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the 4 subjects underwent MMSE and assessment with ADAS-cog as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The correlations among these results were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr ratios in posterior portion cingulate gyrus of the AD and VD groups were (1.24 +/- 0.12) and (1.25 +/- 0.15) respectively, both significantly lower than that of the NC group [(1.46 +/- 0.19), P = 0.003, P = 0.017] without significant difference between the AD and VD groups (P = 0.800) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mI/Cr value of the AD group was (0.74 +/- 0.15), not significantly different from that of the VD group [(0.65 +/- 0.15), P = 0.153], and significantly higher than that of the NC group [(0.62 +/- 0.09), P = 0.007], however, the mI/Cr value of the VD group was not significantly different from that of the NC group (P = 0.662) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr ratio &lt; 1.31 was used as criteria of AD, the positive predictive value of AD was 73% and negative predictive value was 71% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr ratio was positively correlated with the MMSE score (r = 0.731, P = 0.000), and negatively correlated with the ADAS-cog score (r = -0.541, P = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr ratio decreases in the posterior portion cingulate gyrus of AD patients, and has statistical significant correlations with the score of MMSE and ADAS-cog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The H-MRS characteristics of posterior portion cingulate gyrus cannot effectively differentiate the early AD from early VD </plain></SENT>
