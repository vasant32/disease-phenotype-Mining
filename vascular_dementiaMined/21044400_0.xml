<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The economic cost of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is high and can be predicted by cognitive and neuropsychiatric profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The differential costs of the various subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are unknown in Argentina, and this study therefore aimed to compare these costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer-type (DAT), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (FTD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), and their primary caregivers, were evaluated between 2002 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 104 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (DAT = 44, FTD = 34, VaD = 26) were screened and matched by age and educational level with 29 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic variables showed no significant differences among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The annual direct costs were US$4625 for DAT, US$4924 for FTD, and US$5112 for VaD (p &gt; 0.05 between groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the post hoc analysis VaD showed higher hospitalization costs than DAT (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>VaD exhibited lower medication costs than FTD (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DAT exhibited higher anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> drug costs; FTD had higher psychotropic costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, activities of daily living, and caregiver burden were correlated with direct costs (r2 = 0.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The different <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> types have different costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, costs increased with the presence of behavioral symptoms, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and functional impairment of activities of daily living </plain></SENT>
