<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the etiopathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> from the hemorheology viewpoint, platelet activation in the cerebral circulation was studied in 30 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e>, who satisfied the diagnostic criteria of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> proposed by Bennett et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma beta-thromboglobulin concentration gradients (delta BTG) between the jugular vein and the antecubital vein, as indicators of platelet activation in the cerebral circulation, were determined in these patients (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> group) compared with those of different <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes groups (lacunar, atherothrombotic, cardioembolic) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase and 25 patients with various diseases other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among these groups, the elevation of delta BTG levels in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> group (4.55 +/- 6.95) were so frequent and prominent that differences were significant, especially in comparison to those of the cardioembolic group, and the non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The enhanced platelet activation in the cerebral circulation observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> indicated not only the widespread development of underlying vascular lesions, but also accelerated release reaction of vasoactive substances from platelets into the blood stream, which could biochemically injure the vascular wall and neurons downstream, resulting in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
