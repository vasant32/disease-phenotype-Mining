<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined the frequency of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (VCI) and investigated the feasibility of using the Korean version of the VCIHS neuropsychological protocol in a multicenter, hospital-based <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cohort in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 620 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> within 7 days of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> among 899 patients who were consecutively admitted to 12 university hospitals in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological assessments using the 60-minute Korean VCIHS neuropsychological protocol were administered at 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 620 patients, 506 were followed up at 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, 353 (69.8%) were evaluated for cognitive function using the 60-minute Korean VCIHS neuropsychological protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of VCI at 3 months was 62.6%: VCI with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in 49.9% and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in 12.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Old age (P=0.014), poor functional outcomes at 3 months (P=0.029), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes other than small vessel disease (P=0.004) were independent risk factors of VCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: VCI, evaluated using the Korean VCIHS neuropsychological protocol, is substantial at 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The use of the 60-minute Korean VCIHS neuropsychological protocol was feasible in large-scale multicenter studies </plain></SENT>
