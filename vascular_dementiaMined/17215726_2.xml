<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The question was addressed with a structured, evidence-based, clinical, neurologic practice review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants included consultant and resident neurologists, clinical epidemiologists, medical librarians, and clinical content experts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A critically appraised topic format was employed, with a clinical scenario, structured question, search strategy, appraisal, results, summary of evidence, commentary, and bottom-line conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight relevant systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials were identified and served as the principal sources of information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The best evidence to date revealed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> 5 mg/d [number needed to treat (NNT) = 10] was the most effective and best tolerated [number needed to harm (NNH) = 50] of the available agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Galantamine 24 mg/d (NNT = 7) was also effective but less well tolerated (NNH = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Due to insufficient evidence, rivastigmine could not yet be recommended for the treatment of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Memantine appeared to be safe and well tolerated but did not demonstrate effectiveness across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cognitive outcomes and clinical global measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38462">Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, in general, displayed promise as treatments for patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most effective, evidence-based treatments were <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> and galantamine </plain></SENT>
