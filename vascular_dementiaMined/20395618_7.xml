<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This international, multicenter, 24-week trial was conducted from March 2003 to August 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients (N=974; mean age, 73.0 years) with probable or possible VaD were randomized 2:1 to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> 5 mg/d or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coprimary outcome measures were scores on the Vascular-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer Disease</z:hpo> Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale and Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change, plus carer interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyses were performed for the intent-to-treat population with the last-observation-carried-forward method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with placebo, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi>-treated patients showed significant improvement from baseline to end point on the Vascular-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer Disease</z:hpo> Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (least-squares mean difference, -1.156; 95% CI, -1.98 to -0.33; P&lt;0.01) but not on the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change, plus carer interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> who were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> demonstrated stable cognition versus a decline in the placebo-treated group; in those without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, cognition improved with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> versus relative stability with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results on secondary efficacy measures were inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of adverse events was similar across groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eleven <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> group (1.7%), similar to rates previously reported for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> trials in VaD, whereas no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> 5 mg/d demonstrated significant improvement in cognitive, but not global, function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">Donepezil</z:chebi> was relatively well tolerated; adverse events were consistent with current labeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mortality in the placebo group was unexpectedly low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The differential treatment response of VaD patients by hippocampal size suggests that hippocampal imaging warrants further investigation for understanding VaD </plain></SENT>
