<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> in a semi-urban elderly Sinhala-speaking population in Ragama, Sri Lanka </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was conducted in two phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phase I: After informed consent 703 subjects aged &gt; or =65 years from the study area (population 15 828) were screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> using the Sinhalese Mini Mental State Examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects scoring &lt; or =17 were regarded as suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phase II: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects who screened positive in phase I were included in phase II for detailed evaluation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> according <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> IV and NINCDS-ADRDA criteria which included structured neuropsychiatric assessment, laboratory investigations, an axial CT scan of the brain and an informant interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the study sample, 61% were female and 86% were between 65-75 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>42 subjects screened positive in phase I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these, 28 subjects were diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, giving an overall prevalence rate of 3.98% (95% Confidence Intervals (CI) =2.6-5.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these, 20 (71.4%) had probable AD, four had vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (14.3%), two had mixed (vascular and AD) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (7.1%), one had Lewy body <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Greater age, illiteracy and female gender were associated with higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Comparison with other community studies performed in North India suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> prevalence is higher in Sri Lanka </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This may be due to regional differences in disease incidence </plain></SENT>
