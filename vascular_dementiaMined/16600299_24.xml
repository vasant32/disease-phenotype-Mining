<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A possible increase in plasma cytokines levels has been reported in LOAD and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), but the results of previous studies are conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the plasma levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-10 in four groups of older individuals: 60 patients with LOAD, 80 patients with VD, 40 subjects with cerebrovascular disease but without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (CDND), and 42 controls (C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By analysis of covariance (adjustment for age, gender, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, smoking, and alcohol consumption) we found that: *IL-1beta was higher in VD, LOAD, and CDND compared with controls (p&lt;0.005). *TNF-alpha was higher in VD and LOAD compared to C (p&lt;0.05), and in VD compared to LOAD (p&lt;0.03). *IL-6 was higher in VD compared with LOAD (p&lt;0.03) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By logistic regression analysis, we demonstrated that high levels (defined as above the median) of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, but not of IL-6, were associated with increased likelihood of having VD and LOAD compared to C, while high IL-6 levels were associated with a increased probability of having VD, compared with LOAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study support the notion of a low-grade systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in older patients with LOAD or VD, characterized by an increase in plasma IL-1beta and TNF-alpha levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The high IL-6 levels found in VD might be not a specific finding, as it might come from several conditions including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and related vascular risk factors, comorbidity, and frailty </plain></SENT>
