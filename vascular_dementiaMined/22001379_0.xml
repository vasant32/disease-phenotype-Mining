<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162534" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prion diseases</z:e>, in particular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CJD</z:e>), are often suspected, many other nonprion diseases may present as RPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to review the causes of RPD in our center to better understand the underlying conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reviewed clinical, neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid data from patients with RPD admitted to our hospital from 1994 to 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine patients (mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> 72.4 y) with RPD were admitted to our center during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean interval between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and admission was 4.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The final clinical diagnoses were as follows: nonprion <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> (36.8%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CJD</z:e> (30.6%), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (8.2%), toxic-metabolic conditions (8.2%), and other disorders (16.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among cases with informed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (n = 19), the average survival time was 8.6 Â± 9.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survival was shorter among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162534" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prion disease</z:e> (n = 10) than in those with other diagnoses (n = 9, P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, nonprion <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> are the most common cause of RPD in our center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CJD</z:e> is often suspected as a cause of RPD, its frequency depends on the referral differences across specialized centers </plain></SENT>
