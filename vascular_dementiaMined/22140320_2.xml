<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is the second most common type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The underlying association of tobacco and alcohol with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is not completely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Determine the relationship of tobacco and alcohol use with the development of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a matched case-control study of subjects living in Olmsted County, MN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases of VaD were identified through medical record abstraction using conventionally accepted definitions of VaD, using the National Institute of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> and the Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Ensignement en Neurosicences ( NINDS-AIRENS) criteria and were matched to controls by gender and age within 3 years among persons free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> on the index date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exposure data for alcohol and tobacco use were abstracted by trained nurses, along with demographic, lifestyle, cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, and vascular comorbid disease characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Matched conditional logistic regression for univariate and multivariate evaluation of the association of tobacco and alcohol use with VaD was utilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Current alcohol exposure was associated with a decreased risk of VaD with an odds ratio of 0.48 (95% confidence interval: 0.31-0.74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This protective effect of alcohol was seen in men, women, and subjects under 80 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Tobacco use was not associated with VaD in univariate and multivariate analysis, and stratified analysis did not reveal any subgroup-specific associations between tobacco use and VaD in the study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Current alcohol use appears to have protective effects against the development of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The effects are more pronounced in subjects under age 80 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This may reflect the direct vascular effects of alcohol on the vascular system or may represent a surrogate for better social or functional status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Previous alcohol use was not protective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Tobacco use was not a risk factor for VaD status, which was possibly an indication of survivorship bias in the cohort </plain></SENT>
