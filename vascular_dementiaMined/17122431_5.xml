<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: As a measure of cholinergic function, we assessed <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase (ChAT) activities in the frontal and temporal neocortices and the immunocytochemical distribution of ChAT and p75 neurotrophin receptor (P75(NTR)) by in vitro imaging in the nucleus basalis of Meynert of CADASIL subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ChAT activities were significantly reduced by 60% to 70% in frontal and temporal cortices of CADASIL cases, as were ChAT and P75(NTR) immunoreactivities in the nucleus basalis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest cholinergic neuronal impairment in CADASIL and implicate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38323,38324">cholinomimetic</z:chebi> therapy for subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
