<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> (BD), no information is available concerning the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related pathologic changes that may occur in the white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is included in the pathophysiology of the white matter changes in BD, autopsied brains from patients with BD (n = 5) were compared with those of non-neurologic controls (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> in situ nick end labeling (TUNEL) was used as a marker for cell damage with DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A proteolipid protein (PLP) <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) hybridization signal was also used as a sensitive and specific marker of oligodendrocytes as well as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity as a marker of astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were frequent TUNEL-positive cells in the rarefied white matter of patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TUNEL-positive cells were found 15-fold more numerously in BD than in controls (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TUNEL-positive cells were presumably oligodendrocytes because of their coexpression with PLP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The numbers of GFAP-positive astrocytes were significantly decreased in BD compared with those in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reduction in numbers of PLP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>-positive oligodendrocytes were also seen in BD, but these changes did not reach the level of significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The pathologic alterations in BD brains include increased TUNEL-positive oligodendrocytes, associated with degradation of myelin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although TUNEL-positive glial cells did not show typical apoptotic morphologic features, these findings suggest that increase in in situ nick end labeling of oligodendrocytes in white matter may play an important role in the pathophysiology of BD </plain></SENT>
