<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and hip fracture was studied in a representative sample of 85-year olds (N = 485) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was made according to the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of hip fracture was obtained by history and inspection of the hip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone mineral density was measured with dual <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> absorptiometry of the right calcaneus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hip fracture was associated with both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (p &lt; 0.01) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.01) in women, but not in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, the rate of hip fracture was more than twice that found in the general population (32.7% vs 13.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bone density was not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or hip fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Body mass index and body weight were lower in women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and in women with hip fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of hip fracture was also increased in subjects who used <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35471">psychotropic drugs</z:chebi>, especially <z:chebi fb="1" ids="36809">tricyclic antidepressants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A logistic multiple regression analysis showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, use of antidepressants and gender independently contributed to hip fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The reason why subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are at increased risk for hip fractures may be that these subjects have a defective neuromuscular regulation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010521'>gait apraxia</z:hpo>, use more antidepressants, and have a lower body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Another explanation of the association may be that surgery and anesthesia give rise to systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> that leads to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> and ischemic and neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in vulnerable brain areas, and as a consequence may lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or worsen the symptoms in subjects already affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
