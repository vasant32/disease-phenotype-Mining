<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: the aim of the present study was to elucidate a possible relationship between depressive symptomatology and regional brain symptomatology in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 170 consecutive inpatients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (103 patients), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (48 patients), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (19 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients underwent a neuropsychiatric investigation, which included assessments of (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and (2) regional brain symptomatology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Depressive symptomatology was assessed as presence of (a) depressed mood, and (b) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the further statistical analysis, the presence of depressed mood and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The principle of the regional symptom analysis was the successive aggregation of observable symptom variables, leading to the final determination of four possible regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1446648" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain syndromes</z:e> (frontal, subcortical, parietal and global), by way of the Stepwise comparative status analysis (STEP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The possible correlations between regional brain symptomatology and depressive symptomatology were analysed by means of (a) chi(2) statistics, and (b) a logistic regression analysis in which confounding factors were included (age, degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, duration) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: the subcortical syndrome correlated with depressed mood (chi(2), p = 0.002; logistic regression, p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A negative correlation was noted between the parietal syndrome and depressed mood (p = 0.010 and p = 0.013, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No other significant correlations between presence of regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1446648" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain syndrome</z:e> and presence of depressive symptomatology could be seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients with a clinically established subcortical dysfunction appear to be more susceptible to depressive symptomatology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results of this study also suggest that posterior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain dysfunction</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is not correlated with depressive symptomatology </plain></SENT>
