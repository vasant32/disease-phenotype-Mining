<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The link between biometals and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) has been investigated with a focus on local metal accumulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this work, we have looked at systemic metal changes and computed a score (M-score) based on metal disarrangements to discriminate patients with AD from patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) and from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured serum levels of iron, copper, ceruloplasmin, transferrin, and total <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> capacity (TAS), performed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">Apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (APOE) genotyping and calculated non-ceruloplasmin copper ('free' copper') levels, transferrin saturation, total iron binding capacity, and ceruloplasmin-transferrin ratio (Cp/Tf) in 93 patients with AD, 45 patients with VaD, and 48 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects underwent biochemical, neuroimaging and cognitive evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were observed among the tested groups for the levels of copper, free copper, <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxides</z:chebi>, and TAS and for the Cp/Tf with disparity in couple comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On this basis we created the M-score as linear combination of biometal variables and APOE genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Besides its ability to discriminate AD patients vs. controls (ROC AUC=90%), M-score was able to distinguish AD vs. VaD (ROC AUC=79%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we calculated the sensitivity and the specificity for M-score and for the other significant variables: M-score reached the highest sensitivity without a relevant loss in terms of specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When we compared M-score with APOE genotype and Medial Temporal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>Atrophy</z:mpath> score, it resulted statistically better than these diagnostic markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we confirm the link between biometals and AD and suggest its potential as diagnostic tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies may elucidate its potential role as reliable diagnostic test </plain></SENT>
