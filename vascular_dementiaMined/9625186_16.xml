<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A population-based study in Helsinki, Finland (the Helsinki Ageing Study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A prospective birth cohort study with 5-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: A total of 550 subjects of three birth cohorts of 75 (n = 182), 80 (n = 185), and 85 (n = 183) years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: ApoE phenotype was determined from baseline blood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cognitive function of the subjects was tested at baseline and at a 5-year follow-up using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating (CDR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis and type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were determined by a neurologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cohorts were followed for 5 years, and causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards model was used for survival analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analyses were performed comparing the apoE e4 allele and others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, the apoE e4 allele was found in 148 of 550 subjects (27%), in 24% of nondemented persons, in 51% of patients with probable or uncertain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), and in 34% patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The CDR score was worse among subjects with an e4 allele compared with others at baseline (P &lt; .001) and after a 5-year follow-up (P = .007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The crude mortality rates of subjects with and without an e4 allele were 48% (n = 71) and 37% (n = 148), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After controlling for age and gender, the hazard ratio of an e4 allele was 1.61 (95% CI, 1.21-2.14) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> 2.20 (95% CI, 1.03-4.72), and presence of AD 3.24 (95% CI, 1.67-6.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a population aged 75 to 85 years, the presence of an apoE e4 allele is associated with impaired cognitive function, clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, AD, and excess 5-year mortality resulting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes </plain></SENT>
