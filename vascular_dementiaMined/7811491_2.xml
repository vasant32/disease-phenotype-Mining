<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forerunners of the present project are also described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The group's principal aim, which is to determine the distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the "neurological" environment is pursued by enrolling consecutive index cases (new presentations) arriving at 18 Spanish neurological units over a period of 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A standard protocol was used to study the patients and final diagnoses were agreed upon in keeping with international criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and the main <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R, CDR and others) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A second objective is to study risk factors for the main etiological groups of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) and to follow each patient in the cohort until <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in order to assess the course of disease and its biological markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The series will be large, as there are already over 800 cases listed in the coordinating centre even though the period of enrollment has not ended </plain></SENT>
