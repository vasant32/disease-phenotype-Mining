<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Disequilibrium of unknown cause is common in older people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Postmortem specimens from six patients and four control subjects, who were part of a longitudinal study of older people with disequilibrium, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>Cerebral atrophy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventriculomegaly</z:hpo>, and histologic appearance were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Astrocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, arteriolar sclerotic index (1 - [inner diameter/outer diameter]), and arteriolar density were quantified in the frontal periventricular white matter (FPVWM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In comparison with control subjects, most patients had prominent frontal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventriculomegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no other gross pathologic findings, microscopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, or areas of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in patients or control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Markedly reactive astrocytes were found in FPVWM of most patients and not in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients tended to have higher mean sclerotic indices compared with control subjects, but arteriolar density was no different in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>Senile plaques</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo> were no different in patients and control subjects except in one patient, in whom AD developed after entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> (CAA) without intraparenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although there was some overlap between the two groups, the main differences between patients and control subjects were prominent frontal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventriculomegaly</z:hpo>, reactive astrocytes in FPVWM, and increased arteriolar wall thickness (sclerotic index) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest an association between subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> and disequilibrium in older nonhypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
