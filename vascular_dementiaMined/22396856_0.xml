<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in aging is the consequence of a growing vulnerability to an asymptomatic state of neuroinflammation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it is becoming more evident that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> occurs in the brain of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) patients and that the classical mediators of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23899">eicosanoids</z:chebi> and cytokines, may contribute to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In agreement with this observation, aspirin (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) - a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug</z:chebi> - may protect against AD and/or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, both the time of prescription and the dose of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> may be critical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A major indication for low-dose <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> is in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi> (DHA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DHA plays an essential role in neural function and its anti-inflammatory properties are associated with the well-known ability of this fatty acid to inhibit the production of various pro-<z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp>, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23899">eicosanoids</z:chebi> and cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher DHA intake is inversely correlated with relative risk of AD and DHA+<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> supplement may further decrease <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in healthy elderly adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although low-dose <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> may be insufficient for any anti-inflammatory action the concomitant presence of DHA favours a neuroprotective role for <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This depends on the allosteric effects of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> on cyclooxygenase-2 and following production - from DHA - of specific <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> mediators (resolvins, protectins, and electrophilic oxo-derivatives) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> and DHA might protect against AD, although controlled trials are warranted </plain></SENT>
