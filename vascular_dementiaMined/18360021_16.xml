<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The presence of cerebral white matter lesions (WMLs) on MRI is suggested to be a predictive factor for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the relationship between arterial stiffness and WMLs, we performed brain MRI to evaluate the presence of two subtypes of WML-periventricular hyperintensities (PVH) and deep white matter lesions (DWML)-and furthermore, determined the brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (ba-PWV) as a marker of arterial stiffness in 132 elderly asymptomatic subjects (49 men and 83 women, 70.3+/-9.0 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PVH and DWML were observed in 41 (31.0%) and 53 (40.2%) subjects, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ba-PWV values were significantly greater in subjects with PVH than in those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DWML also tended to be associated with ba-PWV, but the correlation was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multiple logistic regression analysis, age and decreased <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> were independently associated with PVH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ba-PWV was also detected as an independent factor for the appearance of PVH (adjusted odds ratio: 2.84, p=0.015) but not DWML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the increase in arterial stiffness contributes to the pathogenesis of PVH rather than DWML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although further study is needed to clarify the difference between WML subtypes, our study suggests that the measurement of ba-PWV is a simple and useful tool for detecting cerebral arterial dysfunction </plain></SENT>
