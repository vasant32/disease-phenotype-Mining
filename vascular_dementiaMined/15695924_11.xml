<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From 1976 to 1995, there were 175 VaD cases, 49 of which were pure, without Alzheimer pathology and only one type of cerebrovascular lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it was found that 6 cases suffered hypoxic hypoperfusive disease, while 7 were found to have large vessel disease and 36 small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to Alzheimer pathology, more than one type of vascular brain pathology was found in the remaining 126 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these cases, diagnosed in accordance with the predominant type of VaD, hypoxic-hypoperfusive lesions were found in 55, large vessel lesions in 50 and small vessel lesions in 110 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It should be stressed that 87% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with hypoxic hypoperfusive lesions also had Alzheimer pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular and aortic pathologies were more prevalent in small vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> than in the other VaD groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinically diagnosed arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was significantly associated with small vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, but not with hypoxic-hypoperfusive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular symptoms varied considerably in frequency between different <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>VaD is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group regarding lesions caused by different pathophysiological mechanisms and with different combinations of brain pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is therefore necessary to identify the various types of vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> for a correlation with clinical symptoms and for diagnostic purposes in the search for risk factors and therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
