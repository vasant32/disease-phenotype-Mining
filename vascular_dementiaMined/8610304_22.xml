<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A consecutive series of patients who met either the criteria of the National Institute of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> and Related Disorders Association for probable AD or the State of California AD Diagnostic and Treatment Centers criteria for probable IVD were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty consecutive patients with IVD were matched for age, sex, and Mini-Mental State Examination scores with 40 consecutive patients with probable AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent a psychiatric interview, a neuropsychological assessment, and single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT imaging with 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with IVD showed significantly more severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0234507" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anosognosia</z:e> (P&lt;.05) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000712'>emotional lability</z:hpo> (P&lt;.01) than AD patients, but no significant between-group differences were found in the frequency and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IVD patients showed significantly more severe deficits in tests of planning, sequencing (P&lt;.05), and verbal fluency (P&lt;.05) as well as significantly more severe cerebral blood flow deficits in the basal ganglia (P&lt;.01) and the frontal lobes (P&lt;.001) than AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IVD showed a relatively more severe dysfunction of the frontal lobes as demonstrated by single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT and expressed in specific psychiatric and neuropsychological changes than AD patients matched for age, sex, and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
