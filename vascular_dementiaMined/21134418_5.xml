<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Behavioral tests and histological evaluations were performed using female Tg2576 mice eight weeks after right common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (rCCAO), which is known to induce a type of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> without neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in nontransgenic mice </plain></SENT>
