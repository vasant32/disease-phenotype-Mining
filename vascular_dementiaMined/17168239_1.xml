<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: 64 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) (n=31), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n=6), mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) (n=9), and major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (n=18), were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent cerebral MRI and single-volume 1H MRS using two echo times (TE, 31 and 136 ms) in the posterior cingulate gyrus and right temporal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The metabolites analyzed were N-acetylaspartate (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17268">myo-Inositol</z:chebi> (mI), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> (Ch), and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> (Cr), and the ratios of Ch/Cr, mI/Cr, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/mI and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to differentiate among the different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, the alterations in imaging and spectroscopy findings were graded from 0 to 4, as was the mean combination of the two, and then ROC curves were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found between the spectra of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) and those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MCI and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>) in the posterior cingulate gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/mI ratio yielded the best area under the ROC curve, with the best sensitivity (82.5%) and specificity (72.7%) in the diagnosis of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/mI and mI/Cr quotients differentiated between the four degenerative pathologies causing the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combination of MRI and 1H MRS significantly improved the accuracy of the diagnosis of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The metabolic differences found among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> using 1H MRS can be useful for differentiating AD, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, MCI, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The combination of spectroscopy and MRI findings is useful in the diagnosis of AD </plain></SENT>
