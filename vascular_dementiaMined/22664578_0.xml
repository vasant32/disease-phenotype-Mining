<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The success of the ageing global population brings with it a growth in the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> sufferers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Older adults are at highest risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and are likely to manifest both vascular and Alzheimer's pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure also changes with ageing and there is evidence linking <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> in midlife to an increased risk of later <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data from later life is sparser </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A number of intervention trials have been carried out with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensives</z:chebi> and have shown mixed results with regard to cognitive and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> outcomes (both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> overall and of vascular and Alzheimer's types) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meta-analyses have in general not found an association between blood pressure lowering and reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> incidence, although the number of cases reported in the placebo controlled trials is invariably lower in the actively treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have also been published with regard to smoking and alcohol use and incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite mixed reports, overall smoking was associated with an increased risk of later <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and alcohol with a 'U' or 'J' shaped relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following the systematic reviews subsequent publications tend to report similar findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The literature in this area suffers from differing populations, lengths of follow up and assessments of both risk factor and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, at present, maintenance of cognitive function would seem to be best served by treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in accordance with current guidelines, controlling blood pressure, reducing smoking and if consuming alcohol doing so in moderation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This review will concentrate on the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and attempt to provide an overview of the evidence relating to vascular related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and the potential risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, alcohol use and smoking behaviour </plain></SENT>
