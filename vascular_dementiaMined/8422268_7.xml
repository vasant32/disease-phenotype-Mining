<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Differences between vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> may be present in both risk factors and in behavioral manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Behavioral distinctions may be apparent only at particular stages of the disease process, but comparisons at different stages require a large number of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The California <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer Disease</z:hpo> Diagnostic and Treatment Center Program has collected data on a large number of subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined differences in risk factors and in behaviors in 502 subjects with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 810 subjects with probable Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With respect to risk factors, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subjects were more likely to have a history of general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found no difference in history of closed head trauma, family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, or cigarette smoking, suggesting that these factors are less likely to have a disease-specific etiologic role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With respect to behaviors, subjects with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subjects with Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were more likely to exhibit wandering in the middle or late stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subjects were similar in five other behavioral factors in the three stages studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that general anesthesia is a risk factor for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> is more prevalent in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, while wandering is more characteristic of Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
