<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We included 47 studies conducted in mainland China, each testing different HM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 43 HM monotherapy studies, 37 reported HM to be significantly better than OM or placebo; six reported similar efficacy between HM and OM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four HM adjuvant studies reported significant efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No major adverse events for HM were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo> in diagnostic criteria, interventions and outcome measures hindered comprehensive data analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Studies suggested that HM can be a safe and effective treatment for VaD, either alone or in conjunction with OM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, methodological flaws in the design of the studies limited the extent to which the results could be interpreted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty most commonly used herbal constituents, including Rhizoma Chuanxiong (Chuanxiong in Chinese), Radix Polygoni Multiflori (Heshouwu in Chinese) and Radix Astragali (Huangqi in Chinese). were ranked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further multi-center trials with large sample sizes, high methodological quality and standardized HM ingredients are necessary for clinical recommendations to be made </plain></SENT>
