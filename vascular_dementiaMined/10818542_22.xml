<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A number of studies have suggested that cerebral changes, particularly deep white matter lesions (WML) visualized on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may be involved in the genesis of late life <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This has been confirmed in a prospective study which also found a relationship between the presence of WML and poor 3-year outcome in elderly depressed subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most studies find these lesions to predominate in frontal lobe and basal ganglia, supporting the hypothesis of "fronto-striatal" dysfunction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether WML are associated with mood disturbance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, proton density and T2-weighted images were obtained in 80 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo>, n = 27; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, n = 28; vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, n = 25) and 26 age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Periventricular lesions (PVL), white matter lesions (WML), and basal ganglia hyperintensities (BG) were visually rated blind to diagnosis using a semiquantitative scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Frontal WML were associated with higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scores in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, implying a common pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> irrespective of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further study of the neurobiological basis of WML is needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This can best be achieved by serial clinical assessment combined with in vivo and in vitro MRI and neuropathological examination </plain></SENT>
