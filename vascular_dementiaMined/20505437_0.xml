<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined serum nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO), oxidized <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoproteins</z:chebi> (ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>), and 3-nitrotyrosine levels (3-NT) in healthy elderly individuals (controls, n=15, mean age=73.4+/-7.9 y), AD patients (n=30; mean age=71.2+/-12.7 y) and VaD patients (n=20; mean age=75.2+/-7.5 y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were under anticholinesterase drug therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that serum NO and ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> levels in AD patients group were significantly higher than in both controls (P&lt;0.001 and P&lt;0.001) and VaD patients (P&lt;0.01 and P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, no significant differences in plasma NO and ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> levels were found between VaD and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our study did not reveal significant differences in plasma 3-NT values of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients when compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant negative correlation between Mini-Mental State Examination score and serum NO levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients (r=-0.349, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum NO levels were also positively correlated with serum ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> levels (r=0.358, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, elevation in serum levels of NO was present in probable AD patients but not in VaD patients, and this seems to be related to both ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> levels and cognitive status </plain></SENT>
