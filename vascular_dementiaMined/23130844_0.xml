<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no studies have examined the Chinese version of the HVLT scale, and appropriate cut-off scores for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the Chinese population remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 631 subjects aged 60 and over were recruited at a memory clinic at Dongzhimen Hospital in Beijing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 249 were classified as exhibiting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognition (NC), 134 were diagnosed with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI), 97 were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), 14 met the diagnosis for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), and 50 were diagnosed with other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, including mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The discriminative capacity of the HVLT total learning score, recognition score and total score were calculated to determine their sensitivity and specificity for detecting MCI, AD and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>, and various cut-off scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HVLT scores were affected by age, education and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The HVLT total learning score exhibited an optimal balance between sensitivity and specificity using a cut-off score of 15.5 for distinguishing AD and other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> from NC using the ROC curve, with sensitivity of 94.7% for distinguishing AD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and specificity of 92.5% for detecting AD and 93.4% for detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We stratified the AD and MCI groups by age, and calculated the validity in each age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the 50-64 years age group, when the cutoff score was 18.5, the sensitivity of 0.955 and specificity of 0.921 were obtained for discriminating the NC and AD groups, and in the 65-80 years group, and optimal sensitivity and specificity values (0.948 and 0.925, respectively) were obtained with a cutoff score of 14.5.When the cutoff score was 21.5 in HVLT total recall, an optimal balance was obtained between sensitivity and specificity (69.1% and 70.7%, respectively) in distinguishing MCI from NC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A cut-off score of 15.5 in the HVLT total learning score led to high discriminative capacity between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and NC groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the HVLT total learning score can provide a useful tool for discriminating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, but not MCI, from NC in clinical and epidemiological practice </plain></SENT>
