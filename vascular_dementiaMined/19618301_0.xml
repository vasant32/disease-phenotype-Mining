<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>Atrophy</z:mpath> of the midbrain in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSNP1">progressive supranuclear palsy</z:e> (PSP) has been demonstrated using conventional brain MRI, and it was recently reported that some patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> also have midbrain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate if the patients with subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (SIVD) have atrophic changes in the midbrain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRIs of 23 SIVD patients, 18 probable PSP patients, and 96 controls were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differences in the distances between midbrain structures were compared across the patient groups and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We measured the anteroposterior diameter (AP), and the distance between the interpeduncular fossa and the aqueduct (IF–AQ), the aqueduct and posterior margin of the superior colliculi (AQ–SC), and the peduncular prominence and the interpeduncular fossa (PP–IF) of the midbrain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The AP diameter and IF–AQ were negatively correlated with age in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (r = -0.21, p &lt; 0.005 for AP; r = -0.14, p &lt; 0.0001 for IF–AQ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In SIVD patients, the AP diameter and IF–AQ were both significantly smaller than in controls (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Changes in the midbrain found for SIVD patients were similar to those seen in PSP patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the midbrain decreases in size with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aging, especially around the tegmental region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This change is more pronounced in patients with SIVD and in patients with PSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prospective functional studies are needed to ascertain the clinical relevance of midbrain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in SIVD </plain></SENT>
