<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatments and cognitive function in elderly hypertensive patients with memory complaints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The association between cognitive function and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drug</z:chebi> therapy was studied in 1241 hypertensive elderly patients with memory complaints attending a geriatric outpatient clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and validated neuropsychological tests (Cognitive Efficiency Profile; CEP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified into four categories according to their cognitive status: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognitive function, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this population aged 78 +/- 8 years, with a mean blood pressure of 152 +/- 19/86 +/- 12 mmHg, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment was prescribed for 57% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, sex and education, treated hypertensive patients had better cognitive function than untreated patients (MMSE score 23.9 +/- 5.6/30 versus 22.7 +/- 6.4/30, P &lt; 0.001, CEP score 49.1 +/- 24.9/100 versus 45.4 +/- 23.7/100, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This association was observed independently of the cognitive status, both in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, MCI, AD and VaD hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio (OR) for AD was 0.58 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42-0.81] in treated compared with untreated hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> therapy, higher cognitive function was observed in patients using calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> compared with those without calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> (CEP 52.9 +/- 24.6/100 versus 46.4 +/- 23.4/100, P &lt; 0.001; OR for AD 0.67; 95% CI 0.45-0.99), independently of blood pressure level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">Antihypertensive</z:chebi> therapy was associated with a lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In particular, the use of calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> was associated with a decreased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and AD independently of the blood pressure level, suggesting a specific neuroprotective effect of these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
