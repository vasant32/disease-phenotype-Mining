<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> in the brain, we designed gene therapeutic constructs to suppress E-selectin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The constructs were composed of microRNAs (miR-E1 and miR-E2) complementary to the human E-selectin cDNA, which were directed by a minimum cis-element of the human E-selectin promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transfection in human aorta endothelial cells (HAECs) with these constructs revealed that the E-selectin promoter was sufficiently activated in response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and miR-E1 and miR-E2 could suppress E-selectin expression resulting in the significant inhibition of leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that the combination of the E-selectin promoter and microRNAs could allow the restricted expression of transgenes in activated endothelial cells and diminish leukocyte recruitment </plain></SENT>
