<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional data from the randomization period of the European Trial in Elderly with Systolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> (Syst-Eur Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Project) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Sixteen European countries and Israel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: We studied 2252 patients aged 60-100 years (mean 70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Spearman correlation of MMSE scores to demographic data or blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The MMSE was successfully completed for 1474 women and 751 men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The baseline blood pressure averaged 173 +/- 10/86 +/- 6 mmHg (means +/- SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median age at which education of patients at school had stopped was 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Men and women who consumed alcohol (28%) had median intakes of 8 and 3 g/day, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median MMSE score was 29 (range 15-30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The maximum score of 30 was attained by 609 (30%) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fifty-nine (3%) patients had a MMSE score of 23 or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The MMSE score decreased with advancing age (r = -0.21, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Both for men and for women, it was positively correlated to the level of education (r = 0.30 and r = 0.32, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>For women after adjustment for age and the level of education, the score was correlated negatively to systolic blood pressure (r = -0.07, P &lt; 0.05) but positively to intake of alcohol (r = 0.06, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a cohort of elderly patients with isolated systolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, baseline cognitive function measured in terms of the MMSE score was high, probably due to selective recruitment of patients who were not clinically <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure was a weak contributor to cognitive status compared with age and level of education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Baseline cognitive function of women was negatively and independently correlated to systolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
