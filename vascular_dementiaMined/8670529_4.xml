<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently new criteria for diagnosing vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) have been suggested by (a) the State of California <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Diagnostic and Treatment Centres (ADDTC) and (b) the NINDS-AIREN group after an international workshop convened by the National Institute for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> (NINDS), with support from the Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (AIREN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have retrospectively applied the new criteria to two groups of patients who are thought by us to be suffering from VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first group (20 patients) had a raised Hachinski Ischaemic Score, i.e. 7 or more (mean HIS = 9.5), and a second group (20 patients) with an HIS between 4 and 6 points (mean HIS = 4.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In group 1, 19 patients fulfilled the ADDTC criteria for probable or possible VaD, compared with 16 patients who fulfilled the NINDS-AIREN criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In group 2, 11 patients fulfilled the ADDTC criteria for probable or possible VaD, compared with only five patients who fulfilled the NINDS-AIREN criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the ADDTC criteria may be more sensitive than the NINDS-AIREN criteria and the HIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, post-mortem validation studies of the new criteria are needed to determine if the improved sensitivity of the ADDTC criteria is at the expense of their specificity </plain></SENT>
