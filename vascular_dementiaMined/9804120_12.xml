<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the prevalence and subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in southern Taiwan, a two-phase study consisting of a phase I screening survey using the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and a phase II diagnostic examination using the CERAD neuropsychological battery and the neurobehavioral examination was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to the household records, stratified random sampling by the degree of urbanization of the community was used, and 2915 inhabitants aged 65 and over participated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10NA criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, NINCDS-ADRDA guidelines for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), and NINDS-AIREN criteria for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) were employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three hundred and ninety-eight persons who had MMSE scores below the cutoff values were recruited into the phase II study, of whom 108 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence rate (PR) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 3.7%, increasing from 1.3% in people 65-69 years old to 16.5% in people 85 years old and older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The age-standardized PR (ASPR) was 4.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AD (58 cases, 53.7%, PR=2.0%, ASPR=2.3%) was the most common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, followed by VaD (25 cases, 23.1%, PR=0.9%, ASPR=0.9%), and mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (eight cases, 7.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age, sex and education using logistic regression analysis, aging was a significant risk factor for AD, VaD and total <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Female sex and illiteracy were significant risk factors for AD only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We concluded that the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in Taiwan is lower than in the developed countries, which could be due to a relatively young elderly population and a high mortality from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>AD is the leading cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Considering the high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevalence, the relatively lower prevalence of VaD in Taiwan deserves further investigation </plain></SENT>
