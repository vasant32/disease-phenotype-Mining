<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight outpatients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> confirmed by cranial computed tomography were enrolled into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and nine patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) based on neuropsychologic test and imaging findings, as well as 10 neurologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly subjects underwent Doppler sonographic examination of extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) and vertebral artery (VA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angle corrected time averaged flow velocity and cross-sectional areas of vessels have been measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow volumes and tCBFV have been calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The measures of tCBFV, anterior CBFV (aCBFV), right CBFV (rCBFV) and right ICA flow volume were significantly lower in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The amounts of tCBFV, aCBFV, rCBFV and right ICA flow volume have been found to be low in AD and VaD patients compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parameters measured for AD and VaD, no significant difference was found except Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reporting the CBF measurements using Doppler ultrasound of extracranial ICA and VA in the differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The tCBFV, aCBFV, rCBFV and right ICA flow volumes and MMSE scores are significant in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, whereas only MMSE scores are significant in the differential diagnosis of AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
