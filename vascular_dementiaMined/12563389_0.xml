<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: From 1989 to 1998, 261 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients were admitted (89.7% studied retrospectively, and 10.3%, prospectively); mean age 63.5 years (+/-13.2), and education 3.6 years +/- 3.9; 25% illiterate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and its subtypes was based on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV criteria, CAMDEX, NINCDS-ADRDA, NINDS AIREN/ADDTC, Lund-Manchester, besides tap-test, including laboratory and neuroimaging examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty five patients (24.9%) had vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 62 ( 23.7%) Alzheimer's, 29 (11.1%) depressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033797" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">pseudodementia</z:e>, 28 (10.9%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, 14(5.4%) mixed, 12 (4.6%) post-traumatic, 9 (3.4%) frontotemporal and 38 (14.5%) had diverse or unknown causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was minimal or mild in 123 (47.1%), moderate in 95 (36.4%), and severe in 43 (16.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Frequency of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 24.9%, Alzheimer's 23.7%, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> 10.7%, in disagreement with that found in the neurological literature (20-30%, 50%, and 1-4%, respectively), probably because we are dealing with cases admitted to a tertiary university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological studies are needed to disclose the true proportion of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> syndromes in the population </plain></SENT>
