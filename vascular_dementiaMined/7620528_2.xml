<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 10 years (1983-1992), clinically overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 35/136 (25.7%) in the age group over 65 years (mean age 79.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Autopsy was performed in 85 cases (mean age 81 years), and clinically overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was seen in 25 subjects (29.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuropathologically, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) was seen in 9 cases (10.6%), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) in 9 cases (10.6%), mixed type in 3 cases (3.5%) and unclassified in 4 cases (4.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the age group of 65-84 years, AD was 5/58 (8.6%), VD was 4/58 (6.9%), mixed type was 2/58 (3.4%), and unclassified was 1/58 (1.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with previous Japanese general population-based data, where VD was more frequent than AD, the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in our leprosarium was high, and pathologically confirmed AD was as common as VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recently, a prophylactic effect of the antileprosy and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory drug</z:chebi> DDS (dapsone, 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35850">sulfone</z:chebi>) has been suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lepromatous patients take more DDS (51.9%) than tuberculoid patients (11.5%), however, as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023351" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tuberculoid leprosy</z:e> (17.9%) in those 65-84 years old is similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lepromatous leprosy</z:e> (15.9%) in our study, we do not support their viewpoint </plain></SENT>
