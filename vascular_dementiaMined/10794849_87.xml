<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neuropathic cerebrovascular lesions and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> have been associated with elevated blood pressure (BP), however, to our knowledge there have been no prospective investigations of an association of blood pressure levels measured in midlife with the microscopic lesions of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship of BP level in midlife to development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo> (NFT), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>neuritic plaques</z:hpo> (NP), and <z:mp ids='MP_0002175'>low brain weight</z:mp> at autopsy among Japanese-American men who were members of the Honolulu Heart Program/Honolulu-Asia aging Study (HHP/HAAS) cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The HHP/HAAS is a population-based, longitudinal study of cognitive function and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with 36 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neocortical and hippocampal NFT and NP were counted per mm(2), and fixed brain weight was measured for 243 decedents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elevated systolic BP, (&gt; or =160 mm Hg) in midlife was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002175'>low brain weight</z:mp> and greater numbers of NP in both neocortex and hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diastolic BP elevation, (&gt; or =95 mm Hg) was associated with greater numbers of NFT in hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results indicate that in addition to the accepted association of high BP with neuropathic cerebrovascular lesions, there is a direct relationship with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, NP and NFT </plain></SENT>
