<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>277 patients with ICVD, 49 patients with probable VaD and 112 controls were recruited for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Distributions of ApoE epsilon4 carriers and allele frequencies were 28.5 and 14.5% for patients with ICVD, 20.4 and 10.2% for patients with VaD, whereas these values were 22.9 and 11.6% for controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Distributions of ApoE epsilon2 carriers and allele frequencies were 10.1 and 5.2% for ICVD patients, 6.1 and 3.1% for VaD patients, but 12.5 and 8.0% for controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between ICVD patients and controls, or VaD patients and controls in their epsilon4 carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those patients aged 65 and under, carrying the epsilon2 allele, had a lower risk of developing ICVD and VaD than did their counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that ApoE epsilon4 plays no significant role in the development of ICVD and VaD, but that ApoE epsilon2 has a protective effect with regard to the development of ICVD and VaD for Taiwan Chinese below the age of 65 </plain></SENT>
