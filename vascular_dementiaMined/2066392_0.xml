<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD, 31 cases), senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer type (DAT, 36 cases) and mixed type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (14 cases) were studied by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was made according to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III and Hachinski's ischemic score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The areas of periventricular high intensity lesions (PVH) and those of brain parenchyma were measured by digitizer which was connected to a computer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The PVH score was obtained by dividing the areas of PVH by those of brain parenchyma at the level of the body of the lateral ventricule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A multiple variable analysis was applied to the PVH scores and risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> using Hayashi's quantification method I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The multiple correlation coefficient between the PVH and the risk factors was 0.685 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most significant correlation was found between Hachinski's ischemic score and the PVH score (partial correlation coefficient: 0.58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations were also found between ADL and the PVH score (0.25), as well as between the Hasegawa <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> score and the PVH score (0.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using the student T test, it was shown that the large PVH group was significantly correlated to poor ADL, whereas the small PVH group was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The large PVH group in VD showed lower Hasegawa score than the small PVH group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, there was no such correlation in DAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>PVH with prolongation of T2 could exist in various pathological states irrespective of their causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Diffuse PVH tended to be frequently observed in VD together with poor ADL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It was therefore thought that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> was the main cause of PVH </plain></SENT>
