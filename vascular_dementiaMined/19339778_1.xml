<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: AD and SIVD were diagnosed using the NINCDS-ADRDA and the criteria proposed by Erkinjuntti et al., respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating (CDR) scale was used to guide the identification of patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> from a prospective clinical database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis was applied to compare the 2 groups on global and individual cognitive domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The greatest cognitive differences between the 2 groups were observed in the domains of visuospatial function (p = 0.001), working memory (p = 0.013) and visuomotor speed (p = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant variation was demonstrated in the executive function domain (p = 0.646) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant differences between AD and SIVD patients were found in episodic memory delayed recall tasks but not in the immediate recall tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A trend towards severer depressive symptoms (p = 0.052) was observed among the SIVD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SIVD patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> have greater deficits in visuospatial function, working memory and visuomotor speed and may also be more depressed compared to AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Executive function tests in general do not distinguish the 2 groups, although timed executive tasks can separate them </plain></SENT>
