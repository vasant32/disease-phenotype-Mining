<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine which of 10 neuropsychological test scores can accurately differentiate patients with probable AD from those with subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (SIVD) for use in evidence-based clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Patients with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were referred to the study by family physicians, geriatricians, and neurologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants received a thorough assessment according to standard diagnostic guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses of probable AD (n = 31) and probable SIVD (n = 31) were made according to consensus criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnosticians were blind to the results of the 10 neuropsychological test scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups in age or Mini-Mental State Examination scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analyses identified 2 neuropsychological tests that best distinguished the groups (sensitivity = 81%; specificity = 84%; positive likelihood ratio = 5.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These were the recognition memory subtest of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test and the Controlled Oral Word Association Test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The AD group performed better on the oral association test, whereas the SIVD group did better on the recognition memory test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with probable AD and probable SIVD can be distinguished with a high degree of accuracy using these 2 neuropsychological tests </plain></SENT>
