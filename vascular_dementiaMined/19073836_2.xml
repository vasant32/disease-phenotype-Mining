<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> is a well-known risk factor for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> is less well-established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Records from Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were abstracted for demographic and medical information for participants with an age &gt;or=60 years who reported being free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five self-reported symptoms (<z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, numbness, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>loss of vision</z:hpo>, inability to speak, and severe dizziness) were used as surrogates representing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information on conventional risk factors for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was also obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 4617 participants were included with a sample-weighted prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> of 6.6% (1417 participants) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The final multivariable analysis revealed a significant association between transient <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> (odds ratio 1.52, 95% CI 1.11-2.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The other 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> symptoms were not significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> in the final model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Systolic blood pressure &gt;140 was most strongly associated with prevalent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> (odds ratio, 9.78, 95% CI 1.49-64.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other associated risk factors included non-white race, male gender, age, education &lt;or=12 years, and history of any alcohol use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> symptoms, self-reported <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> in the face, arm, or leg was significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study indicates that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> symptoms are, even in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Aggressive risk factor modification in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> symptoms may be warranted to prevent potential future <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
