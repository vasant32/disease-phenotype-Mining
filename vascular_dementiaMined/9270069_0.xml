<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By genotyping 193 Japanese patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or AD, and 186 elderly control subjects, we have shown no association between vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and this PS-1 polymorphism, though PS-1 genotype 1/1 and allele 1 frequencies were both significantly higher among patients with AD than among controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These results argue for a specific role of PS-1 allele 1 in the pathogenesis of AD, rather than suggesting a broader role for this allele as, for example, in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
