<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate the association between psychosocial workplace factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in a case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (aged 55-99 years) were recruited from 23 general practices in the city of Frankfurt-on-Main and surrounding area in 1998-2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, 108 were suffering from possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 59 from possible vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 28 from secondary or unclassified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 229 control subjects (aged 60-94 years) was recruited from the same study region: 122 population controls and 107 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-free ambulatory patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A detailed job history was elicited in a structured personal interview (next-of-kin interviews of cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Psychosocial work exposure was assigned to cases and control subjects by linking lifetime job histories with a Finnish job-exposure matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were analysed using logistic regression, to control for age, region, sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in parents, education, smoking, and the psychosocial network at age 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were decreased odds ratios for high challenge at work, high control possibilities at work, and high social demands at work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High risks for error at work revealed a significant positive association with the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Restriction of the analysis to cases with possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> or to cases with possible vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> led to similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results support a role for psychosocial work factors in the aetiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As an alternative explanation, people might have chosen jobs with poor work factors due to preclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, which becomes clinically manifest decades later </plain></SENT>
