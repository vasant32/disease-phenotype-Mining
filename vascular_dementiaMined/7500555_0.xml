<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Though an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarcted lesion was demonstrated as a high signal area on the T2-weighted image, it was impossible to determine whether it was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> because of extensive deep white matter lesions (periventricular hyperintensity and white matter hyperintensity lesions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, only the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarcted lesion was detected on DWI which showed it as a high signal area, suggesting reduced molecular diffusion of water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>), a physiological parameter that characterizes the self-diffusion on water in tissue, was lower in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lesion and higher in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DWI can differentiate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, which is not possible by conventional CT and MRI </plain></SENT>
