<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was run on non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients, at least 60 years old, with isolated systolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (sitting blood pressure of 160-219 mmHg for systolic and below 95 mmHg for diastolic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment was initiated with nitrendipine (10-40 mg/day) possibly associated with enalapril (5-20 mg/day) and/or hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cognitive function was assessed at baseline and annually by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was based on the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was established using the Modified Ischemic Score or the Hachinski score when brain imaging was not available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up by intention-to-treat was 2.0 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was reduced by 50% from 7.7 per 1000 patient-years in the placebo group (number of patients 1,180) to 3.7 cases per 1000 p-a in the active treatment group (n = 1,238) (21 vs 11 patients, p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the last available evaluation, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 8.3 mmHg and 3.8 mm Hg lower (p &lt; or = 0.001) in the active-treatment group, but on average the MMSE scores remained stable in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In older people with isolated systolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment started with nitrendipine may reduce the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the rate observed in the placebo group, treating 1,000 patients for 5 years would prevent 19 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
