<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An increase in the CSF-level of 'neuronal thread protein' (pancreatic thread protein (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi>) immunoreactive material in the brain) has been suggested to be just such a biochemical marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have studied CSF 'neuronal thread protein'-like immunoreactivity (NTPLI) using a microparticle enzyme immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CSF-NTPLI did not differ significantly between AD type I (pure AD) and controls, but was significantly higher in AD type II (senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VAD) as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Signs of blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) damage (elevated CSF/S albumin ratio) were found in both AD type II and in VAD, but not in AD type I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a multiple ANOVA, with age and CSF/S albumin ratio as covariates, no significant difference in CSF-NTPLI between diagnostic groups was noted though both CSF/S albumin ratio and age (P &lt; 0.0001 and P &lt; 0.001 respectively) were found to influence the CSF-NTPLI level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> function was found to influence the CSF-NTPLI level, we examined whether NTPLI was present in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Indeed, serum NTPLI was about 40 times higher than CSF-NTPLI in neurological patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there was a statistically significant correlation between S-NTPLI and CSF-NTPLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, present findings suggest that most of NTPLI in CSF comes from the serum, by passage over the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
