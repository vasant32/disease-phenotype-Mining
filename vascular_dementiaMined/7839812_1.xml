<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to evaluate the prognostic value of early EEG findings in patients after first ischemic cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed routine EEG recordings in 199 consecutive non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients with first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, within 48 h of the event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were subsequently followed for their mental state for 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival analysis, wherein <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was the end-point, was performed on the total sample population and conducted separately on those who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> EEG at time of the event and on those who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>abnormal EEG</z:hpo> findings (focal or diffuse slowing) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>abnormal EEG</z:hpo> at baseline had 2.6 times the risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> than those who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> EEG; this odds ratio was statistical significant (CL: 1.3-5.1, p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was not related to any specific EEG abnormal pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>Abnormal EEG</z:hpo> performed close to the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> appears to be an indicator of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>, probably because it indicates cortical involvement by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or an underlying indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0007313'>cerebral degeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
