<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Binding is a cognitive function responsible for integrating features within complex stimuli (e.g., shape-colour conjunctions) or events within complex memories (e.g., face-name associations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This function operates both in short-term memory (STM) and in long-term memory (LTM) and is severely affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, forming conjunctions in STM is the only binding function which is not affected by healthy ageing or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whether this specificity holds true across other non-AD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> is as yet unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated STM conjunctive binding in a sample of AD patients and patients with other non-AD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> using a task which has proved sensitive to the effects of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The STM task assesses the free recall of objects, colours, and the bindings of objects and colours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with AD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, lewy body <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> showed memory, visuo-spatial, executive and attentional deficits on standard neuropsychological assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, only AD patients showed STM binding deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This deficit was observed even when memory for single features was at a similar level across patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Regression and discriminant analyses confirmed that the STM binding task accounted for the largest proportion of variance between AD and non-AD groups and held the greatest classification power to identify patients with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>STM conjunctive binding places little demands on executive functions and appears to be subserved by components of the memory network which are targeted by AD, but not by non-AD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
