<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study describes the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtypes in Spanish elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified screening surveys, both published and unpublished, in Spanish populations, which fulfilled specific quality criteria and targeted prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in populations aged 70 years and above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surveys covering 13 geographically different populations were selected (prevalence period: 1990-2008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Authors of original surveys provided methodological details of their studies through a systematic questionnaire and also raw age-specific data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prevalence data were compared using direct adjustment and logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The reanalyzed study population (aged 70 year and above) was composed of Central and North-Eastern Spanish sub-populations obtained from 9 surveys and totaled 12,232 persons and 1,194 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (707 of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 238 of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results showed high variation in age- and sex-specific prevalence across studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reanalyzed prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was significantly higher in women; increased with age, particularly for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>; and displayed a significant geographical variation among men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prevalence was lowest in surveys reporting participation below 85%, studies referred to urban-mixed populations and populations diagnosed by psychiatrists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> in Central and North-Eastern Spain is higher in females, increases with age, and displays considerable geographic variation that may be method-related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>People suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> in Spain may approach 600,000 and 400,000 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, existing studies may not be completely appropriate to infer prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and its subtypes in Spain until surveys in Southern Spain are conducted </plain></SENT>
