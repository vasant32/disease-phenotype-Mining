<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Elderly Chinese patients with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> were screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 168 patients who met the criteria for MCI were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma CRP levels were measured at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The global cognitive functions were assessed at baseline and during follow-up periodically with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> enrolled patients were followed and evaluated regularly for 2 years to determine if the patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 168 patients with MCI diagnosed at baseline, 14 (8.3%) deceased, 13 (7.7%) lost to follow-up, and 58 (34.5%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MMSE score of the enrolled patients declined significantly during follow-up (22.1 +/- 3.0 vs 18.6 +/- 5.5, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MMSE score was significantly lower for the patients with high CRP levels than that for those with low plasma CRP levels (-4.9 +/- 5.4 vs -3.2 +/- 4.2, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with high plasma CRP level had an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> as compared with patients with low level of plasma CRP (Log rank test, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High plasma CRP level was associated with accelerated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in patients with MCI </plain></SENT>
