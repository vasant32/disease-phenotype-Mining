<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AAT was performed between July 27 and October 12, 1999 for a total of six biweekly sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The AAT group consisted of 7 subjects; 5 with senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer's type (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e>) and 2 with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The control group was 20 elderly subjects (7 SDAT, 13 VD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were as follows: Comparing between <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> scores at the baseline and those three months later, the average score on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> before AAT (baseline) was 11.43 (+/- 9.00), and that three months later was 12.29 (+/- 9.69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the AAT group, the average baseline N-ADL score was 28.43 (+/- 14.00) and that after ATT was 29.57 (+/- 14.47) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the results of eight subscales of communication behavior three months later were significantly low comparing to those at the baseline in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The evaluation of CgA, which was a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038443" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mental stress</z:e> index, showed a decreasing tendency in the AAT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggested we should use several evaluation methods for evaluation of the changes of patients receiving AAT </plain></SENT>
