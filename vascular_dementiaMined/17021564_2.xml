<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the incidence of Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is rising with age, the future anaesthesiologist will be increasingly confronted with perioperative care of patients with impaired cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper tries to highlight some topics specifically related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: Psychometric testing and behaviour vary according to the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuroanatomical and biochemical correlates for different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are more precise and better documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evidence exists that cognition may be impaired for weeks after anaesthesia, but the mental capacities of those who have undergone surgery are comparable to those of age controls in the long term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most research efforts are focused on improving the daily functioning of people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several new anticholinesterases are being evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is advantageous to keep cognition optimal throughout the perioperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="25" ids="35476">Neuroleptics</z:chebi> may be badly tolerated and, most importantly, pain pathways may be differentially affected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: Anaesthesia in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patient may be complicated by a number of potential problems, including the comorbid pathology, the concomitant anticholinesterase activity, the need for normoventilation, monitoring of anaesthesia depth and the evaluation of postoperative pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Anaesthesia in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376329" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="vcjd">variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</z:e> is aimed at preventing the spread of the causing prion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There is a broad consensus that early return to the preoperative level of cognition is to be pursued, with the help of short-acting drugs and loco-regional anaesthesia </plain></SENT>
