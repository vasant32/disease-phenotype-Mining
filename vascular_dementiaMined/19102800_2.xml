<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that local culture and socioeconomic structure affect our Chinese patients who present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>forgetfulness</z:hpo> to our memory clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective case notes review was undertaken on 454 consecutive patients referred to the memory clinic at Princess Margaret Hospital, Hong Kong </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 385 patients were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 27 had mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was identified in 24 patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognition in 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 55.8% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 26.2% had vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 6.0% had other irreversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 5.2% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo>, 4.9% had undetermined <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 1.8% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median duration from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to medical consultation was two years; 66.5% had advanced disease with initial Mini-mental State Examination scores &lt; or = 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On their first visit, 85% of patients were living in the community; after two years this proportion had fallen to 63% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> patients in Hong Kong apparently enjoy a long subclinical period and only seek medical attention at late stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Local Chinese culture and socioeconomic backgrounds could be the main reasons that underlie these observations </plain></SENT>
