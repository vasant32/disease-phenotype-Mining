<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nondemented controls and subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD), probable/ possible vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), or mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MD) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A cohort design was followed, with follow-up of three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> groups and one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group; data were analyzed in a multiple-equation regression model estimated with full-information methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study was conducted at <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Research Center sites at the University of California, Irvine, and at the University of Southern California </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 226 patients and controls who had completed initial assessment and at least one annual reassessment were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dependent variables were annualized rates of change in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Short-Blessed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating Scale (DRS), the Consortium to Establish a Registry for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> drawings test (CD), the WAIS-R Block Design test (WRB), and the Boston Naming Test (BNT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Independent variables were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity, diagnosis (AD, VD, MD, or control), sex, age, marital status, education, and age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Full-information methods reduced the variance in the change scores by &gt; or = 25% compared with previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The model's prediction of a test's rate of change was almost entirely due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> stage and diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effects of other explanatory variables (sex, marital status, age, and education) were weak and statistically insignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When the effects of other independent variables were controlled, AD and MD patients were found to decline at significantly faster rates than VD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Full-information methods, relative to single-equation methods, substantially reduce the variance of rates of change for multiple psychometric tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>They do so by simultaneously considering the correlated error terms in the regression for each dependent psychometric change score variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The robustness of these results to minor variations in follow-up time suggests that annualization is a reasonably valid procedure for making change scores comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This study's results suggest that change scores in psychometric tests provide information that can be used to aid differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, the large variances of change scores preclude many other uses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Finally, since standardization of psychometric change scores translates <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tests to the same scale (0-100%), standardized change scores are easier to interpret </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The analysis of standardized change scores deserves further investigation </plain></SENT>
