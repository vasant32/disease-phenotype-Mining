<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have characterised the alterations taking place in the intima, media and adventitia of obliterated arterial vessels in seven autopsy cases of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The adventitia of fibrosed vessels showed immunoreactive material indicating a marked deposition of normally occurring collagen types, i.e. I, III and V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar deposits occurred in degenerated parts of the media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two of the cases had, in addition, signs of collagen type VI-immunoreactive material in the adventitia and media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The elastica of arteries was often split and formed multiple layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The inner part of the blood vessel walls contained immunoreactivity to collagen type IV and laminin, indicating increased amounts of basal lamina components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using actin immunostaining the fibrosed arterial vessels showed a severe reduction of smooth muscle cells of the media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, many terminal arterioles presented a marked actin immunostaining, possibly indicating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The endothelial cell layer did not show any changes with regard to expression of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter 1, factor VIII, Ulex europaeus agglutinin I and CD34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Degeneration of the media associated with depositions of collagens type I, III, IV, V and possibly type VI, as well as other components of extracellular matrix, will jeopardize the regulatory functions of the afflicted vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The maintenance of the endothelial lining of the obliterated vessels probably counteracts <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the vessels </plain></SENT>
