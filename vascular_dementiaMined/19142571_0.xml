<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Upon a population study, three polymorphic sites (-491, -427 and -219) and two mutations were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated newly reported -427T/C promoter polymorphism in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), vascular (VD) and mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MD) along with APOE genotype and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Observed polymorphisms were investigated in 267 subjects, 122 of them formed a control group, the group of patients consisted of 145 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty patients were diagnosed with AD, 41 patients were diagnosed with VD and 35 patients left were diagnosed with MD in Slovak Caucasians (Central Europe) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gene-gene interaction analysis showed increase of the risk to develop AD in subjects carrying both the at least one C allele and the APOE E4 allele (OR = 17.93, 95%CI = 3.50-171.54) </plain></SENT>
