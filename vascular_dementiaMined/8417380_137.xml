<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included a psychiatric interview, neuropsychological and physical examinations, comprehensive laboratory tests, electrocardiography, chest radiography, computed tomography (CT) of the head, and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A person close to each subject was also interviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was defined according to the criteria proposed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e> (third edition, revised), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> according to the criteria of the National Institute of Neurological and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009460" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Communicative Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> and Related Disorders Association, and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> according to recently proposed criteria that incorporate information from CT scanning and the patient's neurologic history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 29.8 percent (147 subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The condition was mild in 8.3 percent, moderate in 10.3 percent, and severe in 11.1 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant sex-related differences in prevalence or severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 43.5 percent had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 46.9 percent had vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in 34.6 percent, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> in 4.1 percent, and mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in 8.2 percent), and 9.5 percent had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> due to other causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The three-year mortality rate was 23.1 percent in the subjects without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 42.2 percent in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, and 66.7 percent in the patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> detected by CT scanning were significantly more common in the subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> than in those without it (27.9 percent vs. 12.6 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was present in nearly a third of unselected 85-year-olds in Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Almost half these subjects appeared to have vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, which may currently be more amenable to prevention or treatment than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
