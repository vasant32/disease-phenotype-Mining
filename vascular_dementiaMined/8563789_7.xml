<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was assessed with the Mini Mental State Examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CSF/serum ratio for albumin and IgG as well as the IgG index were used to evaluate blood-CSF barrier function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Various patients showed signs of blood-CSF-barrier (BCB) dysfunction and only few displayed evidence of local IgG synthesis in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) in the AD, VD and in the MD group (IgG index &gt; 0.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The permeability of the blood-CSF barrier was not correlated to measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data support the hypothesis of a BCB leakage in a subgroup of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> investigated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found a small number of patients with increased intrathecal IgG synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elevated CSF immunoglobulins combined with BCB impairment might be associated or caused by a general immune activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data are in agreement with the assumption that an inflammatory process may play a role in a subgroup of patients with AD but also with MD and less likely in VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion BCB impairment and elevated IgG immunoglobulin levels are unspecific either for AD, VD or MD </plain></SENT>
