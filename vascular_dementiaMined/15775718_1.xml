<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Partial least squares discriminant analysis was used to evaluate variables of importance for diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in a clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polymorphism for genotypes of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase (GST) and sulfotransferase 1A1, hypothetically of importance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> disorders, was also included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study population consisted of 73 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), 14 with mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 75 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 28 control cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that several of the variables, such as the presence of ApoE4 allele, high cerebrospinal fluid levels of total tau protein, low levels of beta-amyloid((1-42)), and a low score on the Mini-Mental State Examination, facilitated a discrimination between the diagnoses compared with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The different diagnoses overlapped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were indications that genotypes of GSTs contributed to a subgrouping within AD </plain></SENT>
