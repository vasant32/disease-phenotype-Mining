<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Elevated plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level has been associated with increased risk for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Variation in the levels of this amino acid has been shown to be due to nutritional status and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Under a case-control design we compared fasting levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> and MTHFR genotypes in groups of subjects consisting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls from Northern Ireland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant increase in plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 disease groups compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This remained significant after allowance for confounding factors (age, sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, cholesterol, smoking, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, and nutritional measures) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MTHFR genotype was not found to influence <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels, although the T allele was found to increase risk for VaD and perhaps <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We report that moderately high plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, VaD, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is not due to vascular risk factors, nutritional status, or MTHFR genotype </plain></SENT>
