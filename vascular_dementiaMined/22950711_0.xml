<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine is a dihydropyridinic calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> with a role in neuroprotection, making it a promising therapy for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS/DESIGN: The NICE study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study being carried out in 23 centers in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study population includes patients aged 30-80 who have suffered an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (â‰¤7 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants are randomly allocated to nimodipine (90 mg/d) or placebo (90 mg/d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy is to evaluate the level of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> following treatment of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> with nimodipine or placebo for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Safety is being assessed by observing side effects of nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Assuming a relative risk reduction of 22%, at least 656 patients are required in this study to obtain statistical power of 90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The first patient was recruited in November 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Previous studies suggested that nimodipine could improve cognitive function in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is unclear that at which time-point intervention with nimodipine should occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the NICE study is designed to evaluate the benefits and safety of nimodipine, which was adminstered within seven days, in preventing/treating mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
