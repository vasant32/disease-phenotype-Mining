<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>, like in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> disturbances were found in cholinergic transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cholinergic deficit as manifested in changes of synaptic potentials is reflected in EEG signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL: 31 patients with probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> (according to NINCDS-AIREN and T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Erkinjuntii's criteria) and mean age 72.3 yrs;(M--43%, F--57%) and 14 healthy control subjects with mean age of 72.3 yrs (M-57%, F-43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to the Mini Mental Scale Examination (MMSE) the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> group was divided into two subgroups with mild and moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, their EEGs being recorded with a Medelec and Neuroscan 4.2 system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Visual EEG findings were classified with the use of eight-degree scale of pathological changes by the presence of slow waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Then QEEGs were made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The following parameters were calculated: alpha/slow wave power ratios, the mean wave frequency in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> and in some selected derivations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant difference was found between QEEGs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> subgroups with mild and moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (p&lt;0.05), but there was no significant difference between visual EEGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation between QEEG parameters such as alpha/slow wave ratio or mean wave frequency and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>mental impairment</z:hpo> (according to MMSE results) was found (p&lt;0.001), but there was no significant correlation between degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>EEG abnormalities</z:hpo> in visual analysis and MMSE results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Only QEEGs are correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>mental impairment</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Visual EEG technique as a less precise tool does not reflect the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>mental impairment</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> due to cholinergic deficit </plain></SENT>
