<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently reported that experimental <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as well as hyperhomocystenemia induces VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present research work, for the first time we are reporting the genesis of VaD by deoxycorticosterone <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (DOCA)-salt induced experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we have also investigated the beneficial effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi>, an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi>, an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38462">acetylcholinesterase inhibitor</z:chebi> (AChEI), on DOCA-salt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> induced VaD in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DOCA-salt hypertensive rats performed poorly on <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp>, reflecting impairment in their learning and memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, DOCA-salt treatment has shown a significant impairment of vascular endothelial function (DOCA attenuated <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> induced endothelium dependent relaxation), with a significant reduction in serum <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi>/nitrate levels, along with increased aortic, serum and brain <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> levels (aortic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi>, serum and brain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi> reactive species, brain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>) and brain acetylcholinesterase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatments of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> as well as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> significantly attenuated DOCA-salt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> induced learning and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e>, and changes in various biochemical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It may be concluded that DOCA-salt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> induces VaD in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ARBs and AChEIs may be considered as potential pharmacological agents for the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> induced VaD </plain></SENT>
