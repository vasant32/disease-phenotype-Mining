<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship of two polymorphisms (rs944050 and rs4986938) and their associated haplotypes in the ERβ gene with VaD were examined in 121 Chinese Han women (&gt;50 years of age) including 61 with VaD and 60 healthy age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The potential associations were evaluated using unconditional logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The variant allele G of rs944050 in the ERβ gene increased the risk of VaD (odds ratio = 2.02, 95% confidence interval = 1.08-3.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In haplotype analyses, the ERβ haplotype containing the polymorphism rs944050 variant allele and the polymorphism rs4986938 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> allele was associated with VaD (odds ratio = 1.70, 95% confidence interval = 1.03-2.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The polymorphism rs944050 in the ERβ gene was associated with an increased risk of VaD in Chinese Han women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further studies regarding the association between the ERβ gene polymorphisms and VaD are needed to confirm these findings </plain></SENT>
