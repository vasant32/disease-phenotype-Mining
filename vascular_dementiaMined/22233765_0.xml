<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of L-NBP on learning and memory in AβPP and presenilin 1 (PS1) double-transgenic AD mouse model (AβPP/PS1) and the mechanisms of L-NBP in reducing Aβ accumulation and tau phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve-month old AβPP/PS1 mice were given 15 mg/kg L-NBP by oral gavage for 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>L-NBP treatment significantly improved the spatial learning and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> compared to the vehicle-treated AβPP/PS1 mice, whereas L-NBP treatment had no effect on cerebral Aβ plaque deposition and Aβ levels in brain homogenates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, we found an L-NBP-induced reduction of tau hyperphosphorylation at Ser199, Thr205, Ser396, and Ser404 sites in AβPP/PS1 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the expressions of cyclin-dependent kinase and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase 3β, the most important kinases involved in tau phosphorylation, were markedly decreased by L-NBP treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effects of L-NBP on decreasing tau phosphorylation and kinases activations were further confirmed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> SK-N-SH cells overexpressing <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> human AβPP695 (SK-N-SH AβPPwt) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>L-NBP shows promising candidate of multi-target neuronal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50267">protective agent</z:chebi> for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
