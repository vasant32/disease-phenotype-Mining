<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we evaluated its reliability Belgian French speakers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five groups were studied : <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, depressive patients, patients with AD, patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 47 patients for a validation of a logistic model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of the 5-Word test with the MMSE, both values were included as variables in a logistic regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The probability of diagnosis of AD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> can be calculated and used prospectively for assessment of new cases in a validation study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The importance of the study of free and cued response during immediate and delayed recall was assessed by variance analysis in 4 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A third order interaction (p &lt; 0.001) was observed between the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and AD groups, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) groups and between AD and VD groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With this initial model, 98% of the 62 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and the 57 patients with AD were correctly classified (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For AD diagnosis at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, the sensitivity of the MMSE is increased when it is associated with the 5-Word </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This low-tech bedside method associating the 5-Word test and MMSE has a good specificity for the diagnosis of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is very useful for screening a population of patients at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of cognitive and memory deficiency and for selecting the patients requiring an examination at a memory clinic </plain></SENT>
