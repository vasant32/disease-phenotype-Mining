<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cathepsin D, the most abundant lysosomal and endosomal aspartyl protease, shows beta and gamma secretase activity in vitro by cleaving the amyloid precursor protein (APP) into amyloid beta protein (AÎ²) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polymorphism at position 224, C224T, on exon 2 of cathepsin D gene (CTSD) has been associated with an increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) by some investigators, but there have been contrary findings by others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, an association between CTSD polymorphism and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) has not been reported thus far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether a polymorphism at CTSD C224T is associated with VaD in the Korean population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared the genotype and allele frequencies at this polymorphism site in clinically assessed 162 VaD patients with those in 197 healthy Koreans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The major genotype frequency at CTSD C224T in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls was higher in the Asian population than in various European populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study does not show a significant difference in genotype (P=0.3071) and allele (P=0.2291) frequencies of CTSD C224T between VaD and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was the first genetic association study of CTSD in a VaD population </plain></SENT>
