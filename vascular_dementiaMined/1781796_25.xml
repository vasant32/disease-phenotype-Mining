<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The target variables assessed were the baseline differences of the Sandoz Clinical Assessment Geriatric scale (SCAG) and Syndrom-Kurz-Test (SKT) total scores and the total time required in the subtests of Activity of Daily Living tests (ADL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additional parameters assessed were the physician's global impression, the Mini Mental State Evaluation (MMSE), the Tapping and Trace tests for fine motor rating and the quality in performing the ADL tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adverse drug effects were recorded by DOTES/TWIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>59 of the 66 patients included in the study terminated the trial (29 in the placebo and 30 in the memantine group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the baseline differences of the SCAG total score a statistically significant improvement was observed already after 14 days of memantine treatment as compared to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 42 days this difference was still more pronounced and highly significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant improvements after 14 and 42 days of memantine treatment could also be demonstrated for the SCAG subscales <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disturbances</z:e>, lack of drive, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013985" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">emotional disturbances</z:e>, social behaviour and somatic disturbances </plain></SENT>
