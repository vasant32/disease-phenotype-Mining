<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although serological findings indicate the presence of a relationship between Helicobacter pylori (HP) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, no data have been reported about a possible association of HP with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> HP <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> might play a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level, serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and vitamin B(12) concentrations, plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18405">pyridoxal phosphate</z:chebi> level, IgG and IgA antibodies to HP, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were determined in 30 AD patients, 30 patients affected by vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), and 30 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients and control subjects were matched for age, educational level, and nutritional and socioeconomic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the subjects had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005231'>chronic gastritis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcer</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo>, or major abdominal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HP-IgG level was significantly increased in VaD patients as compared to controls and AD patients, while AD patients had HP-IgG levels higher than those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HP-IgA levels were equally increased in both VaD and AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CRP was higher in AD patients than in VaD patients and controls, although CRP levels in VaD patients were also significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study found an association between HP <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The question remains as to whether this association is due to the ubiquity of HP, or whether it contributes to the neuroinflammatory process in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The relationship between HP and AD, if confirmed by additional studies with a greater number of patients, may have important clinical and therapeutic implications </plain></SENT>
