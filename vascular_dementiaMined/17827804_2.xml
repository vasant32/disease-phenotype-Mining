<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: We examined the level of awareness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> in 63 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), 17 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>), 14 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), and 56 patients with amnestic mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The unawareness of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> was evaluated with a standardized memory questionnaire system based on the Everyday Memory Checklist (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMC</z:e> scores for the patient's own rating, the caregivers' rating and the unawareness score, defined as the discrepancy between these (caregiver rating-patient rating), were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMC</z:e> self-rating scores were comparable among the four groups, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMC</z:e> scores in caregivers were significantly higher in the AD group than in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>, VaD, and MCI groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the unawareness scores were significantly higher in the AD groups than in other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When an unawareness score of 9 or more was defined as significant, impaired awareness was found in 41 (65%) patients with AD, 1 (6%) patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>, 5 (36%) patients with VaD, and in 19 (34%) patients with MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found that impaired awareness was found in two-thirds of patients with mild AD and even in one-third of patients with MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>, in particular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>, had less severe and less frequent unawareness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> than AD, suggesting the difference in the pathophysiology between them </plain></SENT>
