<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To highlight contributions to knowledge made by the Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The CSHA began in 1991, with follow-ups in 1996 and 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was national in scope, with 18 study centres and a coordinating centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It included 10 263 participants; of these, 9008 were in the community, and 1255 were in institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each phase, community participants were screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, and where appropriate, cognitive status was determined by a detailed clinical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data on possible risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were collected at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data on caring for people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were collected in each phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was established at 8% of those aged 65 years and over; incidence (new cases each year) was about 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive impairment</z:hpo> not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (CIND) was more than twice as common as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Factors affecting the risk of institutionalization, mortality, and the health of caregivers were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The costs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were conservatively estimated at dollar 3.9 billion in 1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are presented; it is noteworthy that physical activity appeared to protect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>, particularly for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinical contributions include the development of norms for several neuropsychological tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Other topics include the health of those with CIND, predicting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, medication use, frailty and healthy aging, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The CSHA has contributed substantially to knowledge of the epidemiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, including AD, and to many other topics relevant to seniors' health </plain></SENT>
