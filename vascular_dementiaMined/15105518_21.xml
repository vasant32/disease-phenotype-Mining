<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Vascular causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are increasing in importance because of the aging of the population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Biological markers to distinguish patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) would be very useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because cerebrovascular disease increases expression of brain matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors to metalloproteinases (TIMPs), we hypothesized that MMPs would be elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with VaD, but not in patients with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen patients with VaD were identified, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> caused by multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>progressive dementia</z:hpo> caused by disease of the small cerebral blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed-up for 4 to 10 years to confirm the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients with AD were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients had CSF collected at their initial evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gelatinase A (MMP-2) and gelatinase B (MMP-9) were quantified by gelatin-substrate zymography, and TIMPs were measured by reverse zymography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Control CSF was obtained from neurologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MMP-9 levels were significantly elevated in the CSF of VaD patients compared either to those with AD (P&lt;0.0001) or to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MMP-2, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 were similar in patient groups and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with multiinfarct and small vessel VaD have elevated levels of MMP-9 in the CSF compared with AD and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although CSF MMP-9 increases in other neurological conditions and is not specific for VaD, it could provide an additional biological marker for the separation of patients with VaD and AD </plain></SENT>
