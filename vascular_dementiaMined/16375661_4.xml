<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present longitudinal study compares and contrasts MRI abnormalities among MCI subjects as they progress to DAT versus VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects converting to DAT and VaD confirmed ultimate diagnosis during MCI staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In "mixed cases" the predominant MRI pathology was judged the primary cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Subjects (n = 153) were selected from elderly outpatient volunteers who have been enrolled for 25 years in planned longitudinal studies of aging, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (CN, n = 52), MCI of neurodegenerative (N-MCI, n = 30) and vascular (V-MCI), n = 35) subtypes, plus converted DAT (n = 19) and VaD (n = 17) were diagnosed according to established protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combined Mini-Mental-Cognitive Capacity Screening Examinations (CMC) screened, identified and confirmed MCIs or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebral MRI abnormalities were analyzed utilizing volumetric measurements and visual rating scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with persistently cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, MCI subjects and converted <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> were significantly older without significant gender differences, but cognitively impaired subjects were older than the CN group since age is a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were more frequent among subjects with VMCI and VaD, confirming that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> vascular risk factors contribute to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>, but since vascular risk factors were treated, not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> progressed to VAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative disease</z:hpo>, particularly DAT, were more prevalent among NMCI and converted DAT subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>VMCI showed more extensive leucoaraiosis and lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> than subjects with NMCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>NMCI, prodromal for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer's type (DAT), showed more medial temporal lobe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> with enlarged temporal horns, and fewer vascular lesions </plain></SENT>
