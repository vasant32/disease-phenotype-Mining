<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These criteria include <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, bilateral radiological abnormalities on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and at least two of the following three clinical findings: A) a vascular risk factor or evidence of systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>; B) evidence of focal cerebrovascular disease; and C) evidence of "subcortical" <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
