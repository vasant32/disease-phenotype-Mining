<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and risk factors has not been fully investigated in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following a prevalence study in 1998, we investigated the incidence and associated factors in the same population in 2003 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Randomly selected 771 residents in Tajiri were targeted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The final participants included 204 (65.2%) healthy older adults (Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating, CDR 0) and 335 (73.1%) people with questionable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (CDR 0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and dementing diseases, and possible risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk factors included demographics, lifestyle-related factors, vascular risk factors, cognitive functions, and MRI findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, 3.9% of the CDR 0 and 37.0% of the CDR 0.5 participants developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> during the 5-year period, whereas 40.2% of the CDR 0.5 participants developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> during the 7-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Older adults had a higher incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Higher CDR Box scores had a higher incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the dementing diseases, 60.8% of participants developed Alzheimer' disease (AD), followed by vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), 17.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analyses showed that age, MMSE, cognitive functions such as recent memory, and generalized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> were significant predictors of progression to AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Similarly, predictive factors for progression to VaD were age, MMSE, cognitive functions such as frontal function, and white matter lesions and cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive system including CDR, cognitive tests, and MRI, is recommended in community-based health policy planning </plain></SENT>
