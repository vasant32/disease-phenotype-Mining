<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five (9%) patients and no controls exhibited an intrathecal synthesis of IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The IgG index increased with the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was positively related to presence/absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (p less than 0.05) and correlated positively with diastolic blood pressure (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that immunological factors might be involved in the pathogenesis of VD </plain></SENT>
