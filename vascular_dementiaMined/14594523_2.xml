<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We describe eleven patients, aged 57-90 years, fulfilling the consensus diagnostic criteria for probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, Lewy body <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or Parkinson's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with galantamine that may enhance cholinergic function in the brain by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase and potentiating the effects of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> at nicotinic <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical features were rated according to eight assessment scales in old age psychiatry and additional information was obtained from family and other carers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In some cases caregiver distress was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients described showed a general improvement in cognition and neuropsychiatric symptoms, although observed improvements and effects were not always reflected by the results of formal assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several patients became more independent, particularly in their activities of daily living, and treatment was felt to have helped maintain independence in their home environment, either alone or with their family or carers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One man continued in employment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adverse events included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes in this case series indicate that galantamine is well tolerated and highlight aspects of the different side-effect profiles of the anticholinesterase inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subjective benefits were not always apparent from objective measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These case studies demonstrate the type of patients that may benefit from galantamine </plain></SENT>
