<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other factors, such as health and hygiene, socioeconomic status, and climate can also play an important role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen-hundred subjects (886 women and 614 men; mean age, 67.8 years; range, 39-90 years) were admitted to the Department of Geriatrics at the Oasi Institute between 1992 and 1997; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these subjects were carefully evaluated from a dermatologic point of view </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each subject underwent specialist examinations, routine blood analyses, thoracic X-rays, cerebral computerized tomography (CT) scan, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) when appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A group of subjects without significant neurologic or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e>, comprising 116 women and 60 men (mean age, 64.5 years; range, range, 40-90 years), was selected and used as a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, our attention was focused on the eventual presence of the following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456669" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurologic diseases</z:e>: Alzheimer-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, mixed-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0007123'>subcortical dementia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e>, vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, different subgroups were formed on the basis of such diagnostic categories and the frequency of skin pathology in each subgroup was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 1500 subjects, 1439 stated that they had never been affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatologic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant difference in frequency of skin pathology was found between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and the different patient subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Unsuspected and singular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatoses</z:e> were found, however, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030472" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">paraneoplastic syndromes</z:e>, idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0406352" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tripe palms</z:e>, white fibrous papulosis of the neck as an expression of photoaging, conditions induced by former popular traditions of Sicilian culture (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1288283" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anetoderma</z:e> secondary to the application of Hirudo medicinalis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> ab igne), pigmented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatoses</z:e> never described before in Italy (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0406301" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prurigo pigmentosa</z:e> and friction <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo>), and nail abnormalities (atypical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0423832" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">half-and-half nail</z:e>, and dyschromic nail changes in multiple system <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The dermatologic screening performed in 1500 patients revealed several unexpected diagnoses and some original observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Some rare <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatoses</z:e> were described and certain hypotheses were suggested to explain the peculiar dyschromic changes of the fingernails in multiple system <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, the atypical cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0423832" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">half-and-half nail</z:e>, and the so-called idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0406352" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tripe palms</z:e> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
