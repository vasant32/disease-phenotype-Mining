<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we report our findings from tracking eye movements during a visual search task with different array sizes in 9 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> and compare the number and duration of eye fixations they made with the values obtained in 9 healthy elderly control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> were significantly slower in the tasks with longer center to target distances (mean reaction time), the number and duration of fixations they made did not differ from those in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Impairment of visual search in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> seems to be an effect of general cognitive slowing in more demanding arrays of visual search rather than a specific deficit in parameters of eye fixation </plain></SENT>
