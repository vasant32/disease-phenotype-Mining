<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the literature for original studies reporting either (a) duration of survival or (b) cognitive status following a diagnosis of multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MID) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 13 papers (combined sample size = 470; mean duration of follow-up = 4.3 years), survival was significantly shorter following a clinical diagnosis of MID compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine studies (combined sample size = 175; mean duration of follow-up = 2.9 years) reported at least two mental status scores separated by at least 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among four studies using the Mini-Mental State Examination, no consistent differences in annualized rate of decline could be observed for MID compared with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, no factors were identified that predict rate of decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This review reveals many limitations in our current knowledge about the natural history of VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Understanding would be enhanced by multinational harmonization of definitions for study entry point, diagnosis of VaD, classification of subtypes, as well as cognitive, functional, and behavioral endpoints </plain></SENT>
