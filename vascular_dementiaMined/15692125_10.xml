<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Evidence of drug efficacy in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) is scanty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic trials should address VaD subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the efficacy and safety of the calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> nimodipine in subcortical VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 242 patients defined as affected by subcortical VaD based on clinical (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10) and computed tomography criteria were randomized to oral nimodipine 90 mg/d or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 230 patients (121 nimodipine, mean age 75.2+/-6.1; 109 placebo, 75.4+/-6.0) were valid for the intention-to-treat analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 52 weeks, the Sandoz Clinical Assessment Geriatric scale 5-point variation (primary outcome measure) did not differ significantly between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, patients on nimodipine performed better than placebo patients in lexical production (P&lt;0.01) and less frequently showed deterioration (3 or more point-drop versus baseline) on a Mini-Mental State Examination (28.1% versus 50.5%; chi2 P&lt;0.01) and Global Deterioration Scale (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dropouts and adverse events were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly more common among placebo than nimodipine patients, particularly cardiovascular (30 versus 13; RR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.11 to 4.60) and cerebrovascular events (28 versus 10; RR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.23 to 4.98), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral disturbances</z:hpo> requiring intervention (22 versus 5; RR, 3.88; 95% CI, 1.49 to 10.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A worst-rank analysis, performed to correct for the effect of the high dropout rate in the placebo group, showed additional significant differences in favor of nimodipine in Set Test and MMSE total scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nimodipine may be of some benefit in subcortical VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Confirming previous results, the safety analysis of this study shows that in this high-risk population, nimodipine might protect against cardiovascular comorbidities </plain></SENT>
