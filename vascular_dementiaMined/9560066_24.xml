<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To detect prognostic factors in very old <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), and other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (OD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Follow-up clinical examinations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients from a population-based study after 3- and 7-year intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In an established population aged 75 years and older in Stockholm, Sweden, there were 133 cases of AD, 52 of VaD, and 38 of OD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Predictors of survival at 3- and 7-year follow-up examinations were evaluated by Cox proportional hazard models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Progression was measured as the annual rate of change in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Linear models were used to evaluate predictors of progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Older age, male gender, low education, comorbidity, and functional disability predicted shorter 7-year survival in the 223 prevalent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other factors, including type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity, and duration of the disease were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in the 81 mild to moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> subjects who survived 3 years was 2.4 MMSE points per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD vs OD), higher baseline cognitive function, and greater functional disability predicted faster decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite similar survival probability, predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> varied as a function of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> type: Older age (for AD and VaD), comorbidity (for AD and OD), and functional dependency (for VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In AD, prognostic factors were similar to those described for the combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups, with the exception of an accelerated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> among women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although methodological difficulties exist, it is possible to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> subjects with worse prognoses (shorter survival and faster <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>) by using clinical and demographic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Clinicians and healthcare planners should be aware of the potential usefulness of functional dependence as a prognostic indicator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Finally, the need for careful clinical examinations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> subjects is stressed by the increased mortality found among those <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> who are also affected by other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> conditions </plain></SENT>
