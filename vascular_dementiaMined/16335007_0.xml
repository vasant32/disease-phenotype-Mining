<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects that had been studied on the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were follow-up, and the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) , and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) were counted by person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical diagnosis on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>,AD and VD were based upon the 3rd Edition of Diagnostic and Statistical of Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorder</z:e>, Revised version (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R) and NINCDS-ADRDA criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 2197 subjects of non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> being identified in 1998, were re-surveyed in 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Out of them, 47 new cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> including 37 cases of AD and 8 cases of VD were identified, with an annual incidence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, AD and VD as 0.68%, 0.54% and 0.12% among those of 55 years and over and 0.89%, 0.69% and 0.17% in 65 years and over, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis from single factor logistic regression showed that age and education but not gender were closely related to the occurrence of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were closely related to the occurrence of VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the "Xi' an cohort" was similar to that being reported from other countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AD and VD were an age-related diseases but education seemed to have had great protective effect while lack of formal education served as risk factor to AD </plain></SENT>
