<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Similar metabolic impairment was found in the temporoparietal and frontal association cortex in patients with VD and in those with AD </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The total volume of regions with metabolism below the 95% confidence interval of control values was significantly related to the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> but did not differ between patients with VD and those with AD </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This ratio was also related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity in both types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
