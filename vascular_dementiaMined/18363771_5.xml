<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: i) to describe the neuropsychiatric profile of elderly subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> by comparing vascular (VaD) and degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>, i.e. <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD); ii) to assess whether the severity and type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are associated with clinically relevant neuropsychiatric symptoms (CR-NPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: One hundred and thirty-one out-patients with VaD, 100 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> and 690 with AD were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NPS were evaluated by the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> had lower total and domain-specific NPI scores and a lower frequency of CR-NPS than AD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>, for which frequency of CR-NPS increased significantly with disease severity, particularly in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis showed that a higher CDR score and a diagnosis of degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were independently associated with CR-NPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is associated less with CR-NPS than AD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Frequency of CR-NPS increases with disease severity in AD and, to a lesser extent, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
