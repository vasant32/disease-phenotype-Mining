<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have demonstrated that acupuncture is feasible to treat vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to present behavioral evidence that acupuncture could improve the learning and memory of multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pattern of multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in rats was made by injecting homogeneous emboli into the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of them the rats which showed damage in learning and memory (n = 43) were randomly allocated to 3 groups: impaired group (n = 14), acupuncture group (n = 15) and placebo-acupuncture group (n = 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group (n = 15) and sham-operated group (n = 15) were set as control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The acupuncture group was given acupuncture, which consisted of Tanzhong (CV17), Zhongwan (CV12), Qihai (CV6), Zusanli (ST36) and Xuehai (SP10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> test was employed to assess spatial discriminational ability per group respectively and to analyze the curative effects of acupuncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to the impaired and placebo-acupuncture groups, no cognition impairment was found in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and sham-operated groups, and the statistic analysis showed that there were significant differences between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and impaired groups in ANOVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Shortened mean escape latency was detected in the acupuncture group compared with the impaired group during the same trial days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Search strategy changed from random pattern adopted by impaired and placebo-acupuncture rats to tendency or linear pattern popular in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present results suggested that the acupuncture exerted a protective effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> caused by cerebral multi-infarction in rats, and acupuncture has a specificity of cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Acupuncture as a potential clinic method in treating VD should be developed and investigated in the future </plain></SENT>
