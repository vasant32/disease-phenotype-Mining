<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was shown that P300 parameters depended on age in healthy patients and on expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The changes were more pronounced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the cortical type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The P300 to nonrelevant stimulus was not age-dependent and slightly changed at <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Parameters of the nonspecific visual responses (the latency and duration--the index of homeostatic regulation) and maximal amplitude (reflecting the extent of activation processes) were not age-dependent and changed both in subcortical and cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> types (increase in response latency and duration) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunctions</z:e> of subcortical origin homeostatic changes in the form of increase in time of homeostatic regulation and deterioration of stabilization of brain electrical processes were more pronounced </plain></SENT>
