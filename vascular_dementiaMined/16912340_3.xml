<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was used to assess neuropsychiatric symptoms, and the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) was used to evaluate physical impairment, in 44 outpatients diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, n=22; vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, n=13; mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, n=9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The tests used were standard parts of a memory assessment program at a college of osteopathic medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pearson product moment correlations were used to assess any associations between NPI and CIRS scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant associations were identified between several NPI-assessed symptoms and degree of medical illness as measured by the CIRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815123" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Neurobehavioral problems</z:e> were significantly correlated (P&lt;.05) with illness in the following body organ systems: gastrointestinal (lower), genitourinary, neurologic, ophthalmologic/otolaryngologic, psychiatric, and respiratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The authors' preliminary data underscore the importance of primary care physicians assessing patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> for comorbidity of psychiatric illnesses when conducting medical examinations </plain></SENT>
