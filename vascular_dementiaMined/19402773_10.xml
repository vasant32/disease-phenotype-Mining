<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these factors, both individually and collectively, increase the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alterations in insulin signaling, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and fatty acid metabolism, as well as the accumulation of oxidatively modified and glycated proteins, are associated with both <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data from animal and cell culture models have shown that there is a synergistic interaction between most of these stresses in both AD and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and with the elevated beta-amyloid <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels that are also linked to AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some of these parameters can be modified by diet and others may require novel drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, because of the multiplicity of physiological pathways involved, conventional drug therapies directed against a single target are not going to be effective in treating AD or the complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is therefore likely that the only successful therapy will involve the use of drugs with multiple targets in concert with changes in diet and lifestyle </plain></SENT>
