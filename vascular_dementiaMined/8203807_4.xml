<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specimens were obtained from patients with clinical diagnoses of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and age-matched patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were used for controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In most AD cases, neurofibrillary tangle-like abnormal tau protein (Tau) immunoreactivity was seen in the dendrites and perikarya of the olfactory receptor cells and in the nerve bundles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A senile plaque-like extracellular mass was found in the olfactory epithelium, and it reacted strongly to an anti-Tau antiserum and weakly to an anti-amyloid-beta protein antiserum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ubiquitin (Ubq) immunoreactivity was also observed in the dendrites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tau immunoreactivity of the perikarya and extracellular mass, and Ubq immunoreactivity were especially characteristic of the olfactory mucosa of AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From these results, it is clear that the same pathologic changes in the brain are also present in the olfactory mucosa of patients with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Not only disruption of the central olfactory pathway, but also an olfactory disturbance of AD patients is caused by peripheral changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, an olfactory mucosal biopsy could be a useful method for a definitive diagnosis of AD </plain></SENT>
