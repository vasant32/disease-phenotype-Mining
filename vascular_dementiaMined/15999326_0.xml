<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The term amnesic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is used to describe a condition in which the dominant symptom is a relatively persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> of a vascular origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It may appear in cases of lesions in the posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>), thalamic arteries and anterior choroidal artery, and clinical reports describing this condition are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a 77-year-old male with vascular risk factors who presented sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> mnemonic deficit that affected basic activities of daily living, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Examination of the patient revealed an anterograde episodic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> with an inability to retain new information and short-term memory was also clearly affected, although access to old memories remained relatively intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no other sensory-motor focus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A CAT scan showed a right-side sylvian infarction and hypodense areas in both hippocampuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neuropsychological evaluation revealed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262497" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">global amnesia</z:e>: CME (in Spanish, MEC) 17/30; working memory with CME 7/27; SVF (animals): 7; the 7-minute test (visual/verbal memory: free recall 2/16, facilitated 9/16); clock test: 3/9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Later progression was good, with recovery of short-term memory and the capacity to retain concepts, and the patient was again able to perform the activities he previously carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There are three amnesic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> syndromes with different semiological characteristics, depending on the vascular territory, that is, the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>, thalamic arteries and anterior choroidal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this case, the most striking points are the more intense disorders affecting short-term memory and retention, with relative conservation of long-term memory, and the location of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Its good outcome allows it to be distinguished from vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
