<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that an ecological measure of socio-economic deprivation was related to VaD but not to AD PSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among men with AD PSD and VaD, specific occupations conveyed no altered risk but having fathers who were coal miners was associated with AD PSD and VaD in offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased paternal age was associated with AD PSD but only in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These factors acted independently of one another and did not distinguish between geographical areas of high and low incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The length of survival after presentation with AD PSD distinguished between these areas, and when migration between these areas was taken into account, a plausible multifactorial model of the harmful effects of environment emerged, which acted independently of risk factors acting earlier in life </plain></SENT>
