<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We set out to evaluate the impact of putative cerebrovascular lesions involving cholinergic pathways in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>White matter signal hyperintensities on magnetic resonance imaging involving cholinergic projections were classified according to a three-point rating scale for 171 individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and 34 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medial temporal lobe width was measured, and a neuropsychological test battery was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moderate or severe involvement of cholinergic pathways by white matter signal hyperintensities were identified in 60% of subjects with probable vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 30% of subjects with possible/probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, and 40% of subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> but no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> control subjects were found to have minimal cholinergic pathway involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Medial temporal lobe width and signal hyperintensities on magnetic resonance imaging affecting cholinergic pathways were inversely related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Individuals with moderate and severe involvement of cholinergic pathways by white matter signal hyperintensities had greater impairment of executive function and visuospatial attention, despite equivalent degrees of global impairment and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory dysfunction</z:e> when compared to those with minimal cholinergic pathway involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the first study to suggest that cerebrovascular disease may directly affect cholinergic projections and may exacerbate pre-existing cholinergic deficits of a degenerative nature, especially in probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular compromise of cholinergic white matter projections may therefore be relevant in understanding the effects of cholinergic therapies </plain></SENT>
