<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi> and susceptibility of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> to oxidation in a group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in comparison to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a group of 68 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, according to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV criteria, 42 with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), 26 with Alzheimer type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD) and 46 age-matched persons, with no signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009241" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disorders</z:e> (control group), we measured <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi> and the kinetics of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> oxidation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-Tocopherol</z:chebi> was significantly lower in patients with VaD in comparison to patients with AD and controls: 9.9, 12.6 and 12.6 ng/ml, respectively, p&lt;0.0001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Susceptibility of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> to oxidation, measured by duration of lag phase did not reveal statistically significant differences between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with VaD, low levels of plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi> were observed, which indicate a reduced <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> defense in these subjects </plain></SENT>
