<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether racial differences in medication use relate to racial differences on predisposing, enabling, and need factors associated with use of these agents was also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: National survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Community-based population of informal caregivers of elderly male U.S. veterans with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> living throughout the 48 contiguous states and Puerto Rico </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Two thousand thirty-two African-American and white female caregivers of elderly male veterans diagnosed with probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Depressive symptoms were measured using a modified version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antidepressant, antianxiety, and sedative/hypnotic agents were indexed using the Veterans Affairs medication classification system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of caregivers with depressive symptoms, 19% used antidepressants, 23% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35474">antianxiety agents</z:chebi>, and 2% sedative/<z:chebi fb="6" ids="35717">hypnotics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>African-American caregivers with depressive symptoms were significantly less likely than whites with depressive symptoms to be using antidepressants and antianxiety medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Caregivers who reported higher levels of social support and more physician visits during the previous 6 months were significantly more likely than others to be taking antidepressants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study found that 81% of caregivers with depressive symptoms were not taking antidepressant medication and that African-American caregivers were less likely than whites to be taking antidepressants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that routine screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> caregivers may identify unmet needs for antidepressant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Particular care should be taken to ensure that African-American caregivers are made aware of the potential benefits of such therapy </plain></SENT>
