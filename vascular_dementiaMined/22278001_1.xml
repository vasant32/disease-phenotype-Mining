<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, randomized controlled trials that support this relationship are rare, have rather few participants, and mainly focus on physical (usually aerobic) exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The benefit of an increased physical activity (PA) has been mainly demonstrated for the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, less so for other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> types such as Lewy body <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical evidence builds on a significant amount of animal research pointing to potential mechanisms as to how PA relates to cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While most studies have investigated singular interventions, others have studied the combination of both mental and physical activity to improve cognition or delay decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="?"><plain>However, questions remain such as what type and how much PA is beneficial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This review gives an overview of the current evidence on the clinical and epidemiological level and tries to answer these questions </plain></SENT>
