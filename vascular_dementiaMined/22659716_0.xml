<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study investigated differences in event-related potential (ERP) parameters among early vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) patients, healthy elder controls (ECs), and young controls (YCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A visual "oddball" color identification task was performed while individuals' electroencephalograms (EEGs) were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Approximate entropy (ApEn), a nonlinear measure, along with P300 latencies and amplitudes were used to analyze ERP data and compare these three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients with VD showed more complex ERP waveforms and higher ApEn values than did ECs while performing the visual task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was further found that patients with VD showed reduced P300 amplitudes and increased latencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that patients with VD have fewer attention resources to devote to processing stimuli, lower speed of stimulus classification, and lower synchrony in their cortical activity during the response period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suggest that ApEn, as a measure of ERP complexity, is a promising marker for early diagnosis of VD </plain></SENT>
