<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We aimed to examine whether total intracranial volume (TICV), a marker of premorbid brain size, modified the impact of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (apoE) e4 phenotype and ischemic white matter lesions (WMLs) on odds for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study comprised a population-based sample of 104 demented and 135 nondemented 85-year-olds, and included physical and neuropsychiatric examinations, and head computerized tomography (CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> disorders were defined according to standard criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TICV and WMLs were rated on computerized tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using the highest group as reference, the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) was increased in those with the smallest half, tertile, and quartile of TICV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Smaller TICV increased the odds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in participants with WMLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>WMLs were not associated with increased odds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in those with the largest TICV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The interaction term WMLs*TICV was also significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TICV did not modify the odds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in those with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> e4 phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the impact of brain pathology on the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is modified by premorbid brain size </plain></SENT>
