<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of P300 as an indicator of cognition in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> (BD) and to explore the possible causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>P300 was measured at Cz site in 21 patients with BD and 21 controls matched with age, sex, handedness, and education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This measurement included P300 latency and amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were also given WAIS-RC test and scanned with computerized tomography (CT), and were treated with hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relationships among P300, CT and WAIS-RC score were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BD patients had significantly prolonged P300 latency and a tendency of low amplitude P300, but the amplitude difference was not significant compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>P300 latency was found to be negatively correlated with WARS-RC scale, and positively correlated with the change of white matter low attenuation (WMLA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>WMLA was also correlated with WAIS-RC score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment with HBO reduced P300 latency and had effect on the cognitive part of P300 but had no effect on CT changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The significant association between neurophysiological and neuropsychological measurement suggests that P300 measurement reflects a disrupted aspect of cognitive function in BD patients, and it may be a useful means to assess the degree of subcortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e> and the effect of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>White matter lesion in BD is concerned to the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> by disturbing axonal conduction </plain></SENT>
