<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Tau protein is a microtubule-associated protein located in neuronal axons, which has been used in various configurations as a diagnostic marker of degenerative changes in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to evaluate the use of CSF/ total tau in patients with Alzheimer-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) compared to controls, in order to investigate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL/METHODS: A total of 102 persons were included in the study: 58 AD patients, 24 VD patients, and 20 non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Alzheimer group was divided into 3 subgroups by clinical stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSF samples were collected by routine lumbar puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The level of total tau protein was determined by sensitive sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CSF/total tau in the AD group was significantly higher than in the VD group (median 385.6 pg/ml vs. 101.2 pg/ml) and the controls (1.37 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were also significant differences among the AD stage groups in CSF total tau: highest in the group with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, intermediate in the group with moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and lowest in the group with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Differences in CSF total tau in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups are not attributable to the patients' age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CSF total tau clearly and simply differentiates AD from VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CSF total tau in the incipient stage of AD and its increase in parallel with the progression of the disease may also provide a biochemical test to monitor the development of the disease </plain></SENT>
