<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Amnestic mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) is known to be a preclinical stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Similarly, MCI associated with small-vessel disease (svMCI), might be a forme froste of subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (SVaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patterns of cortical thinning in addition to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> rating on MRI may further elucidate the clinical characteristics and pathogenesis of SVaD and svMCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tried to determine if svMCI differs from SVaD in the distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo>, which may help understand the hierarchy between svMCI and SVaD and possibly also how svMCI evolves into SVaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty patients with SVaD, 34 patients with svMCI, 115 patients with AD, and 96 individuals with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-cognition (NC) were imaged with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including 3-dimensional volumetric images for cortical thickness analysis across the entire brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to NC, svMCI patients showed cortical thinning in inferior frontal and orbitofrontal gyri, anterior cingulate, insula, superior temporal gyrus, and lingual gyrus, while cortical thinning in SVaD patients involved <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these areas plus dorsolateral prefrontal and temporal cortices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest the presence of hierarchy between svMCI and SVaD, and that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> from svMCI to SVaD is associated with lesions in dorsolateral prefrontal and temporal cortices </plain></SENT>
