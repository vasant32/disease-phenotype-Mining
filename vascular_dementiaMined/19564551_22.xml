<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Understanding long-term trajectories in blood pressure of those who do and do not develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> can help clarify the issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Honolulu Heart Program/Honolulu-Asia Aging Study followed a cohort of Japanese American men for an average of 32 years, with systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) measured at 6 examinations and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> assessed at the final 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In an analysis of 1890 men who completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6 of the exams, 112 diagnosed with incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at examination 6 were compared with the 1778 survivors without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Trajectories in SBP and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> up to and including the sixth examination were estimated with a repeated-measures analysis using 3 splines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From midlife to late life, men who went on to develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> had an additional age-adjusted increase in SBP of 0.26 mm Hg (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.51 mm Hg) per year compared with survivors without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over the late-life examinations, this group had an additional age-adjusted decline in SBP of 1.36 mm Hg (95% CI: 0.64 to 2.07 mm Hg) per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These associations were strongest for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and were reduced substantially in men who were previously taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar changes in diastolic BP were observed, but only for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and the findings were not modified by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Over a 32-year period, compared with men who did not, those who did develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> had a greater increase, followed by a greater decrease, in SBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both of these trends are modified by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
