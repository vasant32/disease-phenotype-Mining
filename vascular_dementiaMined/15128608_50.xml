<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Risk factors measured in midlife may better predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in late life because they are less affected by the disease process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors examined the association of midlife dietary intake of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> to late-life <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and its subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were obtained from the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study, a prospective community-based study of Japanese-American men who were aged 45-68 years in 1965-1968, when a 24-hour dietary recall was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analysis included 2,459 men with complete dietary data who were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-free at the first assessment in 1991-1993 and were examined up to two times for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> between 1991 and 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sample included 235 incident cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (102 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 38 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> with contributing cerebrovascular disease, and 44 cases of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relative risks by quartile of intake were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models with age as the time scale, after adjustment for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, other dietary constituents, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E e4 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This analysis suggests that midlife dietary intake of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> does not modify the risk of late-life <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or its most prevalent subtypes </plain></SENT>
