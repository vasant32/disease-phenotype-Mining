<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>Late-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (LOD) has a poor prognosis which may be worsened by the presence of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few studies have explored prospectively the influence of vascular risk factors on longer term prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The original study involved 50 patients with LOD and 35 healthy age matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was at three years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline measures included clinical, neuroradiological and neuropsychological variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcome was assessed by mortality, progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and clinical course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0868892,C0868894,C0011581,C0012706,C0868893" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">depressive disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-two (73%) of the original cohort agreed to be re-interviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven participants had died (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> from the depressed group) and six developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one from the depressed group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> predominated (although not significantly so) among those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For 28 depressed patients with complete follow-up data (56% of the original sample), poor outcome was predicted by lower <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">High Density Lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003565'>raised Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate</z:hpo> (ESR) and a higher score on the Hachinski Index scale and one test of immediate memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Initial response to treatment was not associated with later outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>Late-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0868892,C0868894,C0011581,C0012706,C0868893" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">depressive disorder</z:e> is associated with a high rate of mortality and possibly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Biochemical and inflammatory markers may be important in prognosis and their role should be confirmed in future studies </plain></SENT>
