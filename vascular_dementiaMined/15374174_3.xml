<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From the EEGs (16 electrodes, 10-20 international system except for Fz, Cz, Pz), a 6.5-12 Hz band, wider than the alpha range (alpha-like), was chosen and processed to include the highest theta frequencies characterising the occipital dominant activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A global and occipital EEG Power Index (PI) was calculated and used considering the absolute powers during REC and REO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The MANOVA was used to compare the figures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bearing in mind that the higher the PI value the greater the difference between the 6.5-12 Hz EEG band powers of REC vs. REO, the results were as follows: (i) in the patients with Alzheimer's and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> the global and occipital <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53232">PIs</z:chebi> were significantly lower than those in controls; (ii) in the patients with Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> the same <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53232">PIs</z:chebi> were significantly lower that those of the patients with VaD; (iii) healthy elderly subjects showed significantly lower powers in the 6.5-12 Hz frequencies at T5 and O1 in REO as compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiological implications and the clinical applications of these results are discussed </plain></SENT>
