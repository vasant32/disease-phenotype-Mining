<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study with 78 patients with mild to moderate VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The participants were randomized to receive either <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> (100-mg bid) as placebo (n = 39) or Huperzine A (0.1-mg bid) (n = 39) for 12 consecutive weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mini-mental state examination (MMSE), clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rating (CDR), and activities of daily living (ADL) scores were used for the assessment of cognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The assessments were made prior to treatment, and 4, 8, and 12 weeks of the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The adverse effects of the treatment were also recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 12 weeks of treatment, the MMSE, CDR, and ADL scores significantly improved in the Huperzine A group (P &lt; 0.01 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons), whereas the placebo group did not show any such improvement (P &gt; 0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No serious adverse events were recorded during the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Huperzine A can significantly improve the cognitive function in patients with mild to moderate vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
