<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effects of zanapezil (TAK-147) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> (E2020) on extracellular <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>) levels were investigated by HPLC-microdialysis of ventral hippocampus (VH) in freely moving intact rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the basal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> release rate in the VH is 116.7 +/- 12.4 to 158.4 +/- 22.86 fmol/20 microl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 2, 5 and 10 mg/kg, single p.o., each drug increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> level by 9.4%, 106.5%, 50.8% (TAK-147) and 14.8%, 76.1%, 120.94% (E2020), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ED50 values were 4.52 mg/kg (1.43 - 14.29; R=0.52) and 4.07 mg/kg (1.77 - 9.37; R=0.985) for TAK-147 and E2020, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of data revealed that the relative TAK-147/E2020 potency ratio is 0.773, but the effect of E2020 was accompanied by more prominent skeletal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002380'>muscle fasciculation</z:hpo>, gnawing, <z:mp ids='MP_0003867'>increased defecation</z:mp> and to lesser extent salivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the significant effect of TAK-147 was observed earlier (20 min) than E2020 (60 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this study, we also investigated the effect of both drugs at dose of 5 mg/kg p.o. on blood flow in the VH using Laser Doppler Flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the average blood flow rate in the VH is 6.5 +/- 0.9 ml/min/100 g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TAK-147 did not change blood flow, but E2020 increased blood flow in a biphasic manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The first increment was obtained between 5 and 40 min (11.5 +/- 2.2 to 12.7 +/- 2.2 ml/min/100 g), and the second one 80-105 min (10.7 +/- 1.6 to 13.4 +/- 3.6 ml/min/100 g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present results indicate that both TAK-147 and E2020 increase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> level in the VH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>E2020 showed greater potency than TAK-147, but it induced more <z:hpo ids='HP_0002380'>fasciculation</z:hpo> and other side effects than TAK-147 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the blood flow increasing properties of E2020 could be beneficial in some patients with Alzheimer' disease especially those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, but at the same time, it could also indicate less specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> increasing activity than TAK-147 and higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the fast and specific effect of TAK-147 may be useful for cure of early stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
