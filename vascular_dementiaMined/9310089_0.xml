<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The groups represented four levels of severity of Alzheimer's and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, as well as a ninth group of healthy elderly controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was demonstrated that the patterns of success and failure of recall to individual items across successive trials contained much more information than the marginal trial-to-trial performance scores traditionally used in scoring the test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The GPT model analyzed recall performance in terms of three levels of item storage: unstored, intermediate, and long-term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Associated with the intermediate and long-term storage levels were respective retrieval parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical methods enable one to estimate the parameters for each group, and the analyses revealed group differences in long-term storage that were not evident in a statistical analysis of the marginal trial-to-trial performance scores </plain></SENT>
