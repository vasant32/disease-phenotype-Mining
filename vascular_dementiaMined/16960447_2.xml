<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the German version of the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE) in identifying early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and mild vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) in comparison with the conventional Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study refers to 50 patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of AD, 26 patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of vascular etiology and to 54 cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ACE and MMSE were validated against an expert diagnosis based on a comprehensive diagnostic workup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed using the receiver operator characteristics method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The optimal cut-off score for the ACE for detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in patients with early AD was 85/86, which had a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 86% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The optimal cut-off for the ACE for the identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in patients with mild VaD was also 85/86 and it had a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The kappa values imply a substantial agreement between the diagnoses made by the ACE and the MMSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The German version of the ACE is a short and practical but accurate test battery for the identification of AD and VaD, assessing a broad range of cognitive functions and providing a wide profile of cognitive functions/dysfunctions </plain></SENT>
