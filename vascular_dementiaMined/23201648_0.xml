<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) has <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> pathology and is a challenge for clinicians </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Role of iNOS and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi>-oxidase has been reported in various pathological conditions but there role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (Hypt) induced VaD is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This research work investigates the salutiferous effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40618">aminoguanidine</z:chebi> (AG), an iNOS inhibitor and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2781">4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyacetophenone</z:chebi> (HMAP), a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50423">NADPH oxidase inhibitor</z:chebi> in Hypt induced VaD in rats </plain></SENT>
