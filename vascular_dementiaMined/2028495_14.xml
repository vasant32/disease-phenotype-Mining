<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We occluded the carotid and vertebral arteries of 12 rats for 15 minutes to measure the brain concentrations of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> and cerebral blood flow at the end of the ischemic period or 15, 30, or 150 minutes after circulation was reestablished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The animals were sacrificed with microwave radiation focused to the head immediately after a brief infusion of [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine with rapid sampling of arterial blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain tissue samples were extracted with <z:chebi fb="91" ids="25698">ether</z:chebi> to separate the tracer, which was subsequently measured by liquid scintillation counting and used to calculate local cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aqueous phase was then processed for the measurement of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> concentrations by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed a large increase in tissue <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> content and a decrease in tissue <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> content during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During recirculation, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> levels progressively declined, reaching levels lower than those in four control rats after 150 minutes of recirculation for most brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A reciprocal relation between the brain <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> concentration and local cerebral blood flow was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">Acetylcholine</z:chebi> levels showed an initial rebound to greater than control during recirculation, with subsequent normalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> concentration was positively correlated with brain <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> concentration, provided that cerebral blood flow was greater than 0.3 ml x g-1 x min-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because tissue free <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> was depleted in most brain regions 150 minutes after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e>, we speculate that prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> may produce a greater <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of tissue free <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> with a resulting decline in tissue <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This could play an important role in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679466" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deficit</z:e> associated with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
