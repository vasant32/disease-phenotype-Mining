<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms by which this drug affects vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of QNYZ serum on <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> excitotoxicity in rat fetal cerebral neuronal cells in primary culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exposure of neuronal cells to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> leads to a decrease in the activities of cholinesterase, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase, and streptoavidin peroxidase, and an increase in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These enzyme activities were restored to the levels in untreated cells by the addition of QNYZ serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>QNYZ serum suppressed the increased nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> production induced by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and prevented <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>QNYZ serum also improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> energy metabolism after <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that QNYZ has protective effects against <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-mediated excitotoxicity in neuronal cells during ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
