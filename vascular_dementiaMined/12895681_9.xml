<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with Choto-san (0.75-6.0 g/kg po), a component herb, Chotoko (75-600 mg/kg po), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38958">indole alkaloids</z:chebi> and phenolic fractions of Chotoko prevented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced impairment of spatial learning behaviour in water maze performance of mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A single administration of Choto-san (0.5 to 6.0 g/kg po) or Chotoko (Uncaria genus) produced a dose-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> effect in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and partly inhibited the induction of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">apoplexy</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone SHR (SHR-SP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Choto-san, Chotoko, and its phenolic constituents, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28466">(-)epicatechin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36281">caffeic acid</z:chebi>, significantly protected NG108-15 cells from injury induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> exposure in vitro and also inhibited <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation in the brain homogenate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="38958">Indole alkaloids</z:chebi>, rhynchophylline and isorhynchophylline (1-100 microM), reversibly reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>)-induced current concentration dependently in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor-expressed Xenopus oocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that antidementia effects of Choto-san are due to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi>, free radical scavenging and antiexcitotoxic effects, which are attributed at least partly to phenolic compounds and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38958">indole alkaloids</z:chebi> contained in Chotoko </plain></SENT>
