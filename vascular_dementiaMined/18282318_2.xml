<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study characterized error detection and correction behaviors within the service of everyday tasks in individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Also, the impact of neuropsychological functioning on error detection and correction was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three participants diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) were administered a neuropsychological protocol and the Naturalistic Action Test, which requires performance of three everyday tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Error detection, correction, and the point at which correction occurred (i.e., microslip--before the error was completed, immediate--just after the error was made, delayed--after performing other task steps) was coded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> participants detected 32.7% of their errors and corrected 75.8% of detected errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Participants were more likely to engage in microslips than delayed corrections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tests of executive control and language predicted detection and correction variables; moreover, detection and correction were each related to different aspects of executive functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Microslips were related to naming ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AD and VaD patients did not differ on detection/correction variables, and regression analyses indicated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity and memory abilities were unrelated to detection/correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results specify the error monitoring deficits in AD and VaD and have implications for improving functional abilities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
