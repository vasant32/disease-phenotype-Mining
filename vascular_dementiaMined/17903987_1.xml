<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to assess whether phosphate-related energy compounds and blood supplies are markedly affected by KCI-induced cortical spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (CSD), which leads to metabolic and cerebral blood flow changes in rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> BCCAO, by means of near-infrared spectroscopy and <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi> magnetic resonance spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups: BCCAO for 1 week (n = 6) and 4 weeks (n = 15), and sham operation for 1 week (n = 7) and 4 weeks (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The phosphocreatine (Pcr) index (PCr/PCr+<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e>) and intracellular pH (pHi) were measured pre-CSD, just after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> application, and at 20 and 40 minutes after CSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brains were evaluated by histology with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin and immunohistochemical reaction for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rapid signal changes of oxy-, deoxy-, and total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>-applied brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The PCr index and pHi values in BCCAO were not different than those in control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percentage of vacuolated area in the optic tract and percentage values of GFAP-positive area in the frontoparietal cortex were significantly increased in BCCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The generation of CSD was seen in regions of cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> induced by BCCAO, and severe energy exhaustion did not occur during or after CSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results may suggest that the functional interaction of neurons and glia is sustained even in brain tissue where the metabolic state of neurons is impaired and astrocytes are proliferated </plain></SENT>
