<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the biomarkers of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in urine, as reflected by 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), 8-isoprostaglandin F(2a) (8-isoPGF(2a)) and nitrotyrosine (NT) levels, in a group of well characterized VaD patients and in two control groups of Vascular Not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Demented</z:e> (VaND) patients and health y subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-six subjects from the Tianjin municipality in China were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-six patients were in the VaD group, 24 patients with VaND and 26 persons with no signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009241" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disorder</z:e> were employed as control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Urinary 8-OHdG and 8-isoPGF(2a) was performed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and urinary NT levels were measured by chemiluminescence detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly higher urinary 8-OHdG levels were detected in VaD patients compared to VaND patients and healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, urinary 8-isoPGF(2a) levels were significantly lower in VaD patients compared with two control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For NT levels, no statistically significant differences were observed among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Increased urinary 8-OHdG level was a potential marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it is also important to take into account potential confounders in order to improve the identification of changes in the status of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> as related to VaD </plain></SENT>
