<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies of cognition enhancers have mainly focused on insufficiently defined groups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009241" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognition disorders</z:e>, e.g., "cerebral insufficiency" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With regard to the various biological changes in senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer's type (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e>) and in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), which together make up the great majority of senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>, many authors have encouraged different studies of these types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>, especially since both can be diagnosed clinically with satisfying certainty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since primary care physicians treat the majority of elderly and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients, they have their own experience with cognition enhancers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We were therefore interested to know, how far these physicians differ in their treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> and VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed a representative survey (response rate 83.2%; 145 family physicians and 14 neuropsychiatrists) in the Goettingen area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A written case vignette described a 70-year-old widow with moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and vascular risk factors which are easily treated with drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two versions were randomly assigned, in which (version A) either a "typical" VD history or a typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> history (version B) were described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After perusal, the physician was asked whether and which drugs he would choose to treat the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009241" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disorders</z:e> in this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most frequently, piracetam (A/B: 25.6%/30.9%), ginkgo biloba (24.4%/28.4%), and nimodipine (14.1%/25.9%) were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aspirin was cited by 29.5%(A) and 17.3%(B) of the physicians respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As far as the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was concerned, significant differences were found only for co-dergocrine, which was preferred in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The following inter-group trends were observed: family physicians considered ginkgo biloba more often than nimodipine or co-dergocrine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results show the apparent importance of cost-and safety aspects, while the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> has hardly any impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The latter impression corresponds to the results of drug trials demonstrating no different efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In our opinion, aspirin was not sufficiently taken into consideration </plain></SENT>
