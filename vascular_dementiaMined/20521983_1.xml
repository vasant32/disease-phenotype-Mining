<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, it is demonstrated that water extract of Triticum aestivum L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(TALE) and some of its components have protective effects against vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-induced damage by preserving the myelin sheath and inhibiting astrocytic activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The memory test used a vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> model utilizing bilateral ligation of the carotid arteries of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TALE, some of its components, such as <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi>, total dietary fiber (TDF), arabinoxylan, beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37163">glucan</z:chebi>, and degraded products of arabinoxylan, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22599">arabinose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18222">xylose</z:chebi>, were administered to the animals from day 8 to day 14, following the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one days after the surgery, the water maze test was performed for 5 days, and the time taken to find the platform during training trials (mean escape latency) was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean escape latency was decreased consistently in the TALE-, <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi>-, TDF-, arabinoxylan-, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22599">arabinose</z:chebi>-treated groups, compared with that in the vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To measure brain damage, Luxol fast blue staining and immunohistochemistry of myelin basic protein (MBP) were performed to observe myelin sheath in the white matter, and immunohistochemistry of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was performed to observe the astrocytic reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> reduced the MBP level and increased the GFAP level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="22599">Arabinose</z:chebi> effectively inhibited the MBP and GFAP change, whereas arabinoxylan inhibited the GFAP change only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that TALE and some of its components can be used as a medicinal material for the development of neuroprotective agents against vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
