<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Honolulu Heart Program (HHP) is a prospective study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that has accumulated risk factor data on a cohort of 8,006 Japanese American men since the study began in 1965 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recent examination of the cohort identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) using the criteria of the California <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Diagnostic and Treatment Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To characterize patients with VaD by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype and to investigate risk factors for VaD in a cohort of Japanese American men, aged 71 to 93, living in Hawaii and participating in the HHP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-eight men with VaD were compared with 3,335 men without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (NSND) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Men with VaD were also compared with 106 men with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who were not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> (SND) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Candidate risk factors were measured prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 68 men with VaD there were 34 (50%) whose VaD was attributed to small vessel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, 16 (23%) whose VaD was related to large vessel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and 11 (16%) with both large and small vessel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remainder could not be classified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate logistic regression model for VaD compared with NSND containing variables found to be associated with VaD in a univariate analysis, age (odds ratio [OR] 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13 to 1.27), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (OR 2.50, 95% CI 1.35 to 4.62), and 1-hour postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.88) remained significantly predictive of VaD, whereas preference for a Western diet (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.98) as opposed to an Oriental or mixed diet and use of supplementary vitamin E (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.82) were protective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A similar model for the comparison of men with VaD and SND revealed age (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.35) was predictive of VaD, whereas preference for a Western diet (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.86) was protective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype associated with VaD was lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Age and traditional vascular risk factors are important contributors to the development of VaD in late life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> vitamin E and presently unknown factors related to a Western diet as opposed to an Oriental diet may be protective against developing VaD </plain></SENT>
