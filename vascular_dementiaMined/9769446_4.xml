<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: These two instruments were used as part of the assessment during an epidemiological survey in the municipality of Pylaia, Greece </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The project was based on the World Health Organization Program for Research on Aging and Age-Associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementias</z:hpo> (1992) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It had two phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During phase I, nursing students collected demographic data, risk factors, personal and family history data and they applied MMSE, CAMCOG and scales of everyday life functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During phase II, 4 physicians examined <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects that manifested possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e> (MMSE&lt;27), in order to reach a final diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The final diagnosis was made according to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV and NINCDS-ADRDA criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MMSE and CAMCOG were not taken into consideration in the diagnostic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three hundred and eighty subjects were initially screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were aged over 70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After the exclusion of subjects who were illiterate, blind, etc., the results of 277 subjects were finally analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Subjects with 6 years of education or less accounted for 92.42% of the total study sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twelve of them (5.33%) suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 7 from vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (2.52%) and 1 suffered from secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (0.36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MMSE exceeded 90% sensitivity at the level 22/23 and specificity at 14/15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The levels for CAMCOG were 56/57 and 43/44, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This low performance of both tests is to a large extent due to the functional illiteracy of elderly individuals in Greece, to possible coexistence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0525045" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mood disorders</z:e> or simply to lack of cooperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The analysis of data led to the development of an Epidemiological <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Index (EDI), with a scale ranging from 0 to 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Nondemented subjects had a mean EDI of 5.12 (SD = 1.67) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients had a mean EDI of 1.6 (SD = 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>At the level 4/5 sensitivity was 93.33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Specificity was 93.56 at the level 2/3 </plain></SENT>
