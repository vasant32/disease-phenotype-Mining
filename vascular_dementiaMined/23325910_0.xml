<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate neuropsychological differences between patients with Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-negative SVaD and those with PiB-positive AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recruited patients who were clinically diagnosed with SVaD or AD and underwent an (11)C-PiB-PET scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with SVaD fulfilled <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV criteria for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and had severe white matter hyperintensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of AD was made on the basis of criteria for probable AD proposed by the National Institute of Neurological and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009460" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Communicative Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> and Related Disorders Association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The final patient sample consisted of 44/67 (65.7%) patients with SVaD who tested negative for PiB retention [PiB(-) SVaD] and 61/68 (89.7%) patients with AD who tested positive for PiB retention [PiB(+) AD] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with PiB(-) SVaD performed better than patients with PiB(+) AD on both verbal and visual memory tests including delayed recalls of the Seoul Verbal Learning Test and Rey Complex Figure Test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with PiB(-) SVaD were worse than patients with PiB(+) AD on phonemic fluency of the Controlled Oral Word Association Test and Stroop color test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PiB(-) SVaD were better at memory but worse at frontal function than patients with PiB(+) AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The differences in memory/frontal functions observed between the 2 groups, however, could not differentiate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individual data due to some overlap in the cutoff threshold </plain></SENT>
