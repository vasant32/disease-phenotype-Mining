<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Multi-central randomized controlled trial method was adopted and 270 cases enrolled were randomly assigned to an acupuncture-medicine group, an electroacupuncture group and a medication group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The acupuncture-medicine group were treated by scalp electroacupuncture on Sishencong (EX-HN 1), Baihui (GV 20), Shenting (GV 24), Fengchi (GB 20) and oral administration of Nimodipine; the electroacupuncture group were treated with scalp electroacupuncture; the medication group were treated with simple oral administration of Nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were treated for 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mini-mental state scale (MMSE), ability of daily life-rating scale (ADL-R) and P300 were detected before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total effective rate for cognition improvement was 86.59% in the acupuncture-medicine group, 82.05% in the electroacupuncture group and 43.21% in the medication group, the electroacupuncture group and the acupuncture-medicine group being better than the medication group; and their total effective rates for improvement of ability of daily life were 59.76%, 65.38% and 32.10%, respectively, the electroacupuncture group and the acupuncture-medicine group being better than the medication group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Scores for MMSE and ADL-R and P300 examination indicated that there were significant differences as the acupuncture-medicine group and the electroacupuncture group compared with the medication group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Scalp electroacupuncture or scalp electroacupuncture combined with oral administration of Nimodipine has a better therapeutic effect in improvement of recognition function and the ability of life activity than simple oral administration of Nimodipine with a higher safety </plain></SENT>
