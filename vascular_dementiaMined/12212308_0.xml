<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects were recruited through three agents in Yamanashi prefecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 145 patients (56 men, 89 women, age at baseline 77 +/- 7.9, 80 +/- 8.5 years respectively) with AD and VD participated in the follow-up study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the relationship between demographic or clinical variables and their survival using a Cox regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The analysis revealed that increased age, male gender, the degree of global function and past history of a fall/fracture were associated with a <z:mp ids='MP_0008770'>decreased survival rate</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate was worse for patients with VD than for those with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age and gender, the mortality risk ratio was 1.7 (95% confidence interval 1.1-2.6) for the presence of a fall/fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The same analysis confined to 64 subjects for whom ApoE genotyping data were available replicated the results; a fall/fracture was a predictor of a worse survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, those with ApoE4 tended to have better survival rate than those without (P &lt; 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Those who are engaged in care for AD patients should appreciate the importance of a fall/fracture as a predictor of survival </plain></SENT>
