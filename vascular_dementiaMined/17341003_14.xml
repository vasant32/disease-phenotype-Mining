<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This trial was undertaken to assess the efficacy of EGb 761 in mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with neuropsychiatric features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Double-blind trial including 400 patients aged 50 years or above with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), randomized to receive EGb 761 or placebo for 22 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients scored below 36 on the Test for the Early Detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> with Discrimination from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> (TE4D), between 9 and 23 on the SKT test battery and at least 5 on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a mean -3.2-point improvement in the SKT upon EGb 761 treatment and an average deterioration by +1.3 points on placebo (p &lt; 0.001, two-sided, ANOVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EGb 761 was significantly superior to placebo on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> secondary outcome measures, including the NPI and an activities-of-daily-living scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment results were essentially similar for AD and VaD subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The drug was well tolerated; adverse events were no more frequent under drug than under placebo treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The data add further evidence on the safety and efficacy of EGb 761 in the treatment of cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
