<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study the effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> levels and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels in the whole blood assay, blood samples from 23 elderly persons aged 85 years were stimulated with thrombin or LPS as primary stimulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">Indomethacin</z:chebi> was added in concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 16 microg/ml and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> was added to in concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 8.0 microg/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">Indomethacin</z:chebi> abrogated thrombin- and LPS-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> production at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> concentrations tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> reduced the production of thrombin-induced IL-6 and IL-10 (p&lt;0.05) at physiological concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">Indomethacin</z:chebi> reduced the production of LPS-induced IL-6, IL-1 beta and IL-10 (p&lt;0.05) at the highest <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> concentration tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained upon incubation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> may reduce the thrombin-induced inflammatory reaction by decreasing IL-6 through inhibition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This IL-6 reduction may be relevant for the ability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> to reduce the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the decrease in IL-10 production due to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> suggests a more inflammatory state </plain></SENT>
