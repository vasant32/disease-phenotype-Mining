<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, periventricular WMH (periventricular white matter hyperintensities (PWMH)) and deep WMH (deep white matter hyperintensities (DWMH)) may have different effects on cognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to investigate the contributions of PWMH and DWMH to the topography of cortical thinning and to investigate the relationship among WMH, cortical thinning, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants included 226 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> or subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 135 patients with amnestic MCI or subcortical vascular MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cortical thickness was measured using the surface based method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The topography of cortical thinning related to WMH was distributed in the frontal and perisylvian regions, which was similar to that of PWMH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there were only small areas of cortical thinning inversely associated with DWMH, which were distributed in medial frontal and lingual gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PWMH, but not DWMH, were associated with the frontal thinning and executive dysfunction; where both PWMH and frontal thinning were independently associated with executive dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that PWMH are associated with frontal thinning, which is further associated with frontal executive dysfunction </plain></SENT>
