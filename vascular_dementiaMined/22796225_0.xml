<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are no pharmacological agents with a regulatory approval for its treatment or prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Review of published clinical trial reports indicates that early treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, reduces VaD risk and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slows progression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, unlike <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> class drugs or treatment of blood clotting abnormalities with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> do not appear to have an effect on VaD incidence or progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological agents for treatment of Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD) such as memantine or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38462">acetylcholinesterase inhibitors</z:chebi> have small positive effects on cognition in VaD, which are likely due to their action on co-existing AD-related neuropathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Drug development efforts using novel approaches such as patient stratification by their genotype are needed in order to address the increasing need for effective VaD therapeutics </plain></SENT>
