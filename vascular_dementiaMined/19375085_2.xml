<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vascular component appears to be significant in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to further explore vascular characteristics of patients with both types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> using non-invasive neurosonological methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 38 patients; 16 diagnosed with AD and 22 with VAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vascular risk factors were assessed and ultrasound measurements on common carotid artery (CCA) were performed using Aloka ProSound ALPHA 10 with 13 MHz linear probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among AD patients there were 5 with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (AH), 3 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), 2 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM), 6 with hyper <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lipidemia</z:e> and 1 smoker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nineteen VAD patients had AH, 6 had AF, 12 had hyper <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lipidemia</z:e> and one was diabetic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found no statistically significant differences between groups regarding average body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, pulse pressure, intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>), CCA diameter or arterial beta stiffness indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the trend of BMI increase, slight blood and pulse pressure decrease, CCA diameter increase and beta stiffness index increase was noted in VAD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Even though there was no significant difference found among two explored subgroups of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, there was a tendency of greater systolic and diastolic diameters noted in VAD as well as greater stiffness, especially when measured in the right CCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This indicates that VAD patients may have more prominent vascular changes that may help differentiate the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and further monitor these individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies on a larger number of patients are needed support this evidence </plain></SENT>
