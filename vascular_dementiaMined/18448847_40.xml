<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Follow-ups ranged from 3 to 29 years, and included a total of 14,331 participants evaluated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD), 9,458 participants evaluated for Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), 1,893 participants evaluated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>, and 4,793 participants evaluated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compatible results were pooled using meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consistent associations between high midlife TC and increased risk of AD, and high midlife TC and increased risk of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence supporting an association between late-life TC and AD, or between late-life TC and any <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No study reported a significant association between TC (measured in midlife or late-life) and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An association between high midlife TC and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> was found but there was only weak evidence for an association between TC and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two of seven studies reporting data on the interaction between TC and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> e4-allele had significant effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results suggest the effect of TC on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> risk occurs in midlife but not late-life, and that there may be different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factor</z:e> profiles for AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results from additional studies involving long-term follow-up of midlife samples will allow for clarification of the association between age, TC and risk of specific types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data are required to inform recommendations of modulation of cholesterol to reduce or delay <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
