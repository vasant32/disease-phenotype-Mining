<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Identification of patients with the progressive form of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, referred to by some investigators as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger disease</z:e>, is important for treatment trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pathologically, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger disease</z:e> is associated with small vessel disease, extensive regions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo>, inflammatory cells around damaged blood vessels, and lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinically, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger disease</z:e> have impairments of gait and balance, focal neurological findings, and executive dysfunction on neuropsychological tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>White matter changes on MRI are thought to be due to hypoxic episodes related to hypoperfusion of the vulnerable deep white matter secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and other vessel diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disruption of the blood-brain barrier suggests an <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinases are present in the brain of patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and can be measured in the cerebrospinal fluid of some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preliminary studies with quantification of the blood-brain barrier, using the multiple time graphical method (Patlak plots), supports disruption of the blood-brain barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because no single clinical feature or diagnostic test is sufficient to identify patients with the small vessel form of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, we propose that a multimodal approach will be needed to select patients for treatment trials </plain></SENT>
