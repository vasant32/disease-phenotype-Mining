<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This method partially corrects for partial volume effects and is an improvement over the approach using the signal intensity as a function of time when confounding factors such as changing cortical cerebrospinal fluid volumes are involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The maximum value for delta R2 is found to correlate with relative cerebral blood flow as assessed by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> inhalation and can be used to discriminate between vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With this method, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range for delta R2 values is found to be the same for both young (19-40 years old) and elderly (65-85 years old) healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
