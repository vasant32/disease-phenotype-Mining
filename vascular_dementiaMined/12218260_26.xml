<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ratio of amyloid-positive to amyloid-negative vessels in the leptomeninges of the frontal pole from each patient was calculated subsequent to microscopical examination, and the severity of WML was graded according to previously published criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In AD cases without a significant component of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, the level of CAA was found to correlate with the degree of WML diagnosed and graded by neuropathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neither age nor severity of AE correlated significantly with WML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There may be several reasons for the conflicting results of this study vis-Ã -vis earlier investigations; the roles played by different methods of staining, CAA quantitation and patient subgroup selection are also discussed </plain></SENT>
