<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data are from the cohort of 3703 Japanese-American men who were followed in the Honolulu Heart Program (HHP;1965-1971), and subsequently re-examined in 1991 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the risk (odds ratio (95% CI)) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> associated with categories of systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>), stratified by never/ever treatment with anti-hypertensive medications, and adjusting for age, education, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> epsilon allele, smoking and alcohol intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among those never treated (57% sample), the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was OR 95% CI 3.8 (1.6-8.7) for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> of 90-94 mm Hg, and 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>3 (1.7-10.8) for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> of 95 mmHg and over compared to those with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> of 80 to 89 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to those with SBP of 110 to 139 mm Hg, the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 4.8 (2.0-11.0) in those with SBP 160 mm Hg and higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure was not associated with the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in treated men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results were consistent for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study suggests elevated levels of blood pressure in middle age can increase the risk for late age <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in men never treated with anti-hypertensive medication </plain></SENT>
