<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: It has been reported that aspirin and other <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi>) may protect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer's type and/or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, co-morbidity and the dose of aspirin may be critical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A major indication for low-dose aspirin is prophylaxis after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e>, conditions that may obscure an anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> effect by the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, low-dose aspirin may be insufficient if the protective effect is due to an anti-inflammatory mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess whether high-dose or low-dose aspirin may protect against Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in subjects aged &gt; or =80 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For comparison, effects of (other) <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="58" ids="46195">paracetamol</z:chebi> and D-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8497">propoxyphene</z:chebi> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Global, cross-sectional, and longitudinal (1991-2000) epidemiological analyses of clinical, cognitive and drug treatment data on 702 individuals 80 years old or more (351 twin pairs of same sex), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> alive at inclusion: mean age 83.9 years (80-99 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Calculations were made with logistic regression of associations between use of various <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesics</z:chebi> and cognitive function, after adjustment for age, gender, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Users of high-dose aspirin had significantly lower prevalence of Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and better-maintained cognitive function than non-users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were numerically similar but not significant associations with use of low-dose aspirin and other <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no such associations with use of either <z:chebi fb="58" ids="46195">paracetamol</z:chebi> or D-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8497">propoxyphene</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Aspirin might protect against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, but controlled trials are warranted </plain></SENT>
