<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Leukoaraiosis (LA) is a common radiological finding in the elderly and may reflect cerebral small vessel disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> has been identified as a major cause of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, the mechanisms for this association remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore aimed to measure brain metabolites in LA using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) as to determine the relationship between cognitive function and neurochemical white matter profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recruited 23 patients with LA and 23 age- and sex-matched healthy controls consecutively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multi-voxel (1)H-MRS was performed with a volume of interest located in centrum semiovale that contained mainly white matter voxels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three main ratios of N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>)/Cr, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> (Cho)/Cr and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cho were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spearman rank correlation coefficients were calculated between the cognitive function and the measured metabolite ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found significantly lower levels of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cho and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr ratios in lesioned white matter in patients with LA than healthy controls (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ratios of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cho and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearing white matter (NAWM) were higher than lesioned white matter and lower than controls, but this difference was not significant (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a positive relationship between Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cho in NAWM (r = 0.417, P = 0.048), and also a positive relationship between MMSE and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr in lesioned white matter (r = 0.551, P = 0.006) in patients with LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A positive relationship between the Z scores of the executive function and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cho in lesioned white matter (r = 0.557, P = 0.006) was also found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The main finding of this study was a significant reduction in the ratios of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cho in lesioned white matter, which indicates a marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> or dysfunction in patients with LA, which was correlated with cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This relationship between cognitive function and metabolic changes suggests that (1)H-MRS can be explored as a marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> in patients with LA </plain></SENT>
