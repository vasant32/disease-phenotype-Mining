<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The recognition that G(1)/S checkpoint dysfunctions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) has opened a novel avenue for better understanding the pathogenesis of AD, as well as for searching for new biomarkers for early diagnosis of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In present study, we investigated Cyclin E, Rb, CDK2 and E(2)F-1, four G1/S checkpoint proteins, in the lymphocytes from AD and non-AD individuals, and explored their potential for diagnosis application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 176 age-matched subjects were enrolled, including 74 AD patients, 80 cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals, 11 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) and 11 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood lymphocytes were collected from each individual, and Cyclin E, Rb, CDK2, E(2)F-1 were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blot, confocal microscopy and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that four proteins increased in AD compared with other three groups (P&lt;0.05), with CDK2 and E(2)F-1 showing higher statistical significance (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their specificity/sensitivity (Cyclin E 84%/81%; Rb 74%/89%, CDK2 80%/78%, E(2)F-1 85%/85%) were acceptable, suggesting their potential as biomarkers for AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these four proteins had the best sensitivity/specificity and highest Area Under the Curve (AUC) in mild-moderate AD compared with the severe AD </plain></SENT>
