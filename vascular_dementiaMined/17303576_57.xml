<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>beta-Amyloid <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (Abeta), which is derived from the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages from beta-secretase (BACE1) and presenilin-1 (PS1)/gamma-secretase, is widely believed to trigger a cascade of pathological events culminating in AD and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> increases the expression and the enzymatic activity of BACE1 by up-regulating the level of BACE1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, resulting in increases in the APP C-terminal fragment-beta (betaCTF) and Abeta </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hypoxic treatment fails to further potentiate the stimulatory effect of HIF-1alpha overexpression on BACE1 expression, suggesting that hypoxic induction of BACE1 expression is primarily mediated by HIF-1alpha </plain></SENT>
