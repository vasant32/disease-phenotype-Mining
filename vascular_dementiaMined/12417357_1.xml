<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the rate of cognitive and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral changes</z:hpo> in patients with probable VaD-L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured rates of change on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Digit Span, Logical Memory, Controlled Oral Word Association Test, CERAD battery and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) of 77 [age at entry 65.9+/-8.1 (mean+/-standard deviation) years] patients with probable VaD, periventricular white matter and basal ganglia lacunae, longitudinally studied for 25.7+/-11 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean number of follow-up visits was 2.6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall annual vascular event rate was 0.25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VaD-L in mildly and moderately impaired patients is characterized by progressive cognitive and behavioral decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of cognitive and behavioral progression depends on the occurrence of vascular episodes (VE) during the course of the illness [(-1.1) MMSE and (+4.0) NPI points annually without VE vs. (-2.0) and (+10.3) points following VE] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rates of progression are a function of the severity of the cognitive and behavioral impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Impaired cognition</z:e> is associated with impaired behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A subgroup of VaD-L patients runs a progressively deteriorating course despite the absence of clinically apparent new vascular episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: VaD-L is characterized by cognitive and behavioral decline in 83% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The rate of decline is determined mainly by the severity of the cognitive and behavioral impairment at baseline and by the occurrence of new vascular episodes </plain></SENT>
