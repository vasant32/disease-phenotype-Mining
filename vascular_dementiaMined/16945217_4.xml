<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Increasing life expectancy of the population leads to a higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exact differentiation between the most common types, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) and Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD), is crucial to the development and application of new treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both conditions are thought to differ greatly by their extent of microvascular affection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcranial and extracranial ultrasound permits analysis of cerebral hemodynamics and should help to differentiate between VD and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compare multimodal ultrasound data between VD, AD and controls, and give an overview of the literature on this topic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty VD and 20 AD patients were studied and compared with 12 age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transcranial color-coded ultrasound was performed to assess blood flow velocity (V(mean)) and pulsatility indices (PI) of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extracranial duplex and Doppler ultrasound techniques were used to assess the blood volume flow (BVF) in the anterior circulation (both internal carotid arteries [ICA]) and posterior circulation (both vertebral arteries [VA]), the global cerebral blood flow (CBF = BVF(ICA) + BVF(VA)), the global cerebral circulation time (CCT = time delay of echo-contrast bolus arrival between ICA and internal jugular vein) and global cerebral blood volume (CBV = CCT x CBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> V(mean) in VD (36 +/- 8 cm/s) and AD (43 +/- 13 cm/s) were significantly lower than in controls (59 +/- 13 cm/s) but did not differ significantly between VD and AD groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PI (1.1 +/- 0.2; 1 +/- 0.2; 0.9 +/- 0.2) only differed significantly between VD group and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CBF and CCT in VD (570 +/- 61 ml/min; 8.8 +/- 2.6 s) and AD (578 +/- 77 ml/min; 8.2 +/- 1.4 s) were similar but differed significantly from controls (733 +/- 54 ml/min; 6.4 +/- 0.8 s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>BVF in the anterior and posterior circulation of VD group (412 +/- 62 and 158 +/- 38 ml/min) and AD group (428 +/- 62 and 150 +/- 41 ml/min) were significantly lower than in controls (537 +/- 48 and 199 +/- 26 ml/min) but did not differ significantly between the patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Transcranial and extracranial ultrasound does not help to distinguish between VD and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, our results add insight into the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, arguing in favor of a common 'vascular' pathway in both conditions </plain></SENT>
