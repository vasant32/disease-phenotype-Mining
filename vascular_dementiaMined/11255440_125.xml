<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A 1-year prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Community population-based sample of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive patients admitted for investigation of cognitive symptoms to the Piteå River Valley Hospital, Piteå, Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A total of 241 patients with probable AD (n = 105), possible AD (n = 58), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n = 23), mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (n = 20), Lewy body <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n = 9), other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> (n = 3), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>psychiatric disorders</z:hpo> (n = 5) and nondemented individuals (n = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cerebrospinal fluid tau and CSF-Abeta42 were assayed each week as routine clinical neurochemical analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity were defined using the regression line from 100 control subjects from a multicenter study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Positive and negative predictive values were calculated for different prevalence rates of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found increased CSF-tau and decreased CSF-Abeta42 levels in probable and possible AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity was 94% for probable AD, 88% for possible AD, and 75% for mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, whereas specificity was 100% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>psychiatric disorders</z:hpo> and 89% for nondemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Specificity was lower in Lewy body <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (67%) mainly because of low CSF-Abeta42 levels and in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (48%) mainly because of high CSF-tau levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity for CSF-tau and CSF-Abeta42 increased in patients with AD possessing the ApoE epsilon4 allele, approaching 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At a prevalence of AD of 45%, the positive predictive value was 90% and the negative predictive value was 95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebrospinal fluid tau and CSF-Abeta42 have so far been studied in research settings, under conditions providing data on the optimal performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We examined a prospective patient sample, with assays run in clinical routine, giving figures closer to the true performance of CSF-tau and CSF-Abeta42 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The predictive value for AD was greater than 90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these biomarkers may have a role in the clinical workup of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, especially to differentiate early AD from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aging and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>psychiatric disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
