<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (EOD) and to compare the clinical characteristics of EOD vs <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (LOD) in a geographically defined area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used data from the Registry of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> of Girona (ReDeGi), an epidemiologic surveillance system of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ReDeGi is a standardized clinical registry of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases diagnosed in the 7 hospitals of the Health Region of Girona (Catalonia, Spain), which encompasses an area of 5,517 km(2) and 690,207 inhabitants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EOD cases were defined as those patients residing in the target area at the time of diagnosis who were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with an age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms before 65 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ReDeGi registered 2,083 patients between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2009 (6.9% EOD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate of EOD for the age range 30-64 was 13.4 cases per 100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval 11.3-15.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> was the most frequent cause of EOD (42.4%), followed by secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (18.1%), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (13.8%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (9.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EOD cases at the time of diagnosis were less impaired on the Mini-Mental State Examination and had a greater score on the Blessed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating Scale behavior subscale than LOD cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of a personal history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was higher in EOD cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of EOD was less than 6 cases per 100,000 person-years in the age group 30-49 years; in the age group 50-64 years, the incidence rate was 3-fold higher and doubled with each 5-year increase </plain></SENT>
