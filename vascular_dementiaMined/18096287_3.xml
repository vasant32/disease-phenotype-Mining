<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on purinegic hypothesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo>, pharmacological treatments enhancing <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> activity could be effective treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Propentofylline is a novel xantine derivative which is being developed for treatment of degenerative and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It enhances extracellular <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> level via inhibition of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the efficacy of propentofylline as an adjuvant agent in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> in an 8-week double blind and placebo controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eligible participants in this study were 50 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were inpatients and were in the active phase of the illness, and met <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV-TR criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients were allocated in a random fashion, 25 to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> 6 mg/day plus propentofylline 900 mg/day (300 mg TDS) and 25 to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> 6 mg/day plus placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The principal measure of the outcome was Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although both protocols significantly decreased the score of the positive, negative and general psychopathological symptoms over the trial period, the combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> and propentofylline showed a significant superiority over <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> alone in the treatment of positive symptoms, general psychopathology symptoms as well as PANSS total scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The means <z:hpo ids='HP_0002071'>Extrapyramidal Symptoms</z:hpo> Rating Scale for the placebo group were higher than in the propentofylline group over the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the differences were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The present study indicates propentofylline as a potential adjunctive treatment strategy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, results of larger controlled trials are needed, before recommendation for a broad clinical application can be made </plain></SENT>
