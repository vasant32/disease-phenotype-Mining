<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ongoing controversy over the challenges associated with the diagnosis and management of patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> with cerebrovascular disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) has led to difficulties with establishing epidemiology and diagnostic guidelines, as well as deciding upon optimal management practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In March 2001, an international group of physicians and researchers gathered to resolve some of these issues and provide clinicians with useful information relating to this large patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to simple coexistence, VaD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> appear to share common pathophysiological mechanisms, such as neurotransmitter abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatments that target the common pathophysiology of the two conditions may prove useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To date, no reports have been published of any agent demonstrating broad efficacy (on cognitive and noncognitive outcomes) in VaD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> in randomised, controlled trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recent developments in understanding the pathophysiology of the conditions, however, have taken researchers an important step closer to finding an effective treatment, not only for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, but also for those with coexisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and those with VaD </plain></SENT>
