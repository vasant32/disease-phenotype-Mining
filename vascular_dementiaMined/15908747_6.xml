<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four patients with initial clinical suspicion of beginning <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were examined, 12 of them with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent SPET and PET within 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were compared with the final clinical diagnosis at follow-up - 9 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), 1 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo>, 1 with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), 7 with mixed type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MIX) and 6 without any type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Metabolic indices (MI) and PI were compared with each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The regional cerebral blood flow difference (rCBFdiff) calculated as local uptake difference between the right and left hemisphere was measured for patients with VD and MIX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PET showed higher sensitivity and specificity in identifying the different types of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (44--91 and 78--89%, respectively) than SPET (11--64 and 79--89%, respectively), especially in detecting AD (sensitivity 44%, specificity 83%) and MIX (sensitivity 71%, specificity 78%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Especially in patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, PET was the superior imaging modality for predicting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using PET, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> could be excluded in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who did not develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, a weak correlation between PI and MI was observed (rho=0.64, p&lt;0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rCBFdiff in patients with VD and MIX ranged from 7 to 37% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study on patients with initial suspicion of beginning <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> who underwent both imaging modalities, PET and SPET, PET was the superior imaging method, especially in the detection of early AD or MIX </plain></SENT>
