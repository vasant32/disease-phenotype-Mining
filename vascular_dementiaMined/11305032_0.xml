<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer's type (DAT) and 25 with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) admitted to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> ward in Kyoto Higashiyama Geriatric Hospital were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed them at the time of their institutionalization, and every three months for two years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On institutionalization, a difference between DAT and VD was noted in the group in which more than 10 areas of Resident Assessment Protocols (RAPs) were triggered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The areas of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011206" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">delirium</z:e>, communication, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260653" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">behavioral problem</z:e>, activities, activities of daily living, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo>/fluid maintenance, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35471">psychotropic drugs</z:chebi> were evenly triggered in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the DAT group, however, mood state and dental care were also highly triggered while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> and nutritional status were highly triggered in the VD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three months later, marked improvements were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the above areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, RAPs areas gradually increased subsequently, and there was marked difference in the areas and their course of progression between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the DAT group, the trigger rate of the areas of communication, activities of daily living, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo>, dental care, nutritional status and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> gradually increased after 6 months of evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the trigger rate in only three areas, such as communication, visual function and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo>, become higher, but their patterns of increase were irregular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mental and physical conditions of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were different in each <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtype on institutionalization, but these conditions improved soon after </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the conditions were gradually became worse, and the pattern was different in each <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> group: DAT showed a slow and steady decline, but VD showed irregular progression and differed among individuals </plain></SENT>
