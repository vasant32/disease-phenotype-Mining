<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence and clinico-neuropathological characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>Cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> (CAA) in Chinese elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined 362 archived brains of aged Chinese from 60 to 95 years of age using an antibody against beta-amyloid <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and with Gongo red, Bodian and Luxol fast blue stains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CAA appeared in 114 examined brains and the incidence rate in age groups of 60 - 69, 70 - 79, 80 - 89 and beyond 90 years was 22.1%, 26.7%, 46.5% and 66.7% separately; frontal lobe was the most frequently CAA involved part of brain; CAA may also distribute in subcortical white matter and cerebellum dentatus nucleus; close relationships were found between CAA and multiple cerebrovascular lesions, consequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>; without other neuropathological changes, CAA alone may result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CAA is a common neuropathological finding in brains of Chinese elderly, with an increased prevalence with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CAA may distribute in subcortical white matter and cerebellum dentatus nucleus, which have been seldom reported before and may contribute to vascular lesions in these areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CAA may not only participate in the pathogenesis mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, but also result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> directly through <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> neuronal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
