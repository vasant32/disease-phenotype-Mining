<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have prospectively followed over a 5-year period 434 volunteers who were at intake ambulatory, functional, presumably nondemented, and between 75 and 85 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six (an incidence of 3.53 per 100 person-years at risk) developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>progressive dementia</z:hpo>: 32 met diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) (an incidence of 2.0 per 100 person-years at risk), 15 had vascular or mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 9 had other disorders or remain undiagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>New cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were as common as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and twice as common as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and AD were age (over 80) and gender (female); other reported risk factors such as family history, prior head injury, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid disease</z:hpo>, maternal age, and smoking were not risk factors for AD in this elderly cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was the major risk factor for vascular or mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> but not a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> per se were also risk factors for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The major predictor of the development of AD was the mental status score on entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 58.5% of the cohort who made zero to two errors on a 33-item mental status test had a less than 0.6% per year chance of developing AD, whereas the 16% of the cohort with five to eight errors on this test developed AD at a rate of over 12% per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is possible to identify a large cohort of 80-year-olds who are at low risk for AD and a smaller cohort at very high risk </plain></SENT>
