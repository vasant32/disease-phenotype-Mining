<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The major forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> share in common overactivation of the CD40-CD40-L complex, leading to high levels of proinflammatory cytokine production by immune cells of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>), including microglia and astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consequently, both neuronal survival and signaling are negatively affected, leading to the characteristic progressive loss of higher cortical functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have reviewed the literature concerning the involvement of this complex in the pathology of three major forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>: Alzheimer's-type, HIV-associated and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is followed by a discussion of current preclinical and clinical therapies that may influence this interaction, and thus point the way toward a future neuroimmunological approach to inhibiting the effects of CD40-CD40-L in neuropsychiatric disease </plain></SENT>
