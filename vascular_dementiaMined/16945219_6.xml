<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent research suggests that vascular pathology may be also important for the development and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is still unknown whether there is a relation between damage of brain capillary endothelial cells (BCEC) and subsequent cholinergic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> on cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of BCEC and cholinergic neurons in an organotypic brain slice model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that BCEC were heavily damaged in medium at pH&lt;6.6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cholinergic neurons incubated in medium pH 6.0 degenerated within 2-3 days and were not rescued by nerve growth factor (NGF) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both BCEC and cholinergic cells were not affected at pH 7.4, 7.0 or 6.6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that both endothelial cells and cholinergic neurons have a high capacity to compensate for pH changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At a certain pH, however, the vascular and neuronal cells show the same vulnerability, indicating that a low pH is deleterious for the cerebral microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future studies are necessary to explore whether temporary pH changes could be responsible for cerebrovascular damage and cholinergic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
