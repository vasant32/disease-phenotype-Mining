<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is often a paucity of clues as to the underlying pathology, and while the diagnosis will usually prove to be either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, there may be clinical features suggesting rarer alternatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This case of a 71-year-old lady with a 3-month history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>progressive cognitive decline</z:hpo> illustrates clinical features suggestive of Creutzfeltd-Jakob disease such as rapid decline in conscious level and myoclonic jerking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was confirmed by 3 means: (1) Electroencephalogram demonstrating periodic sharp wave complexes, (2) MRI brain showing cortical ribboning and high signal in the caudate nucleus, and (3) presence of protein S100 and protein14-3-3 in the cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postmortem brain histology confirmed a typical spongiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Establishing an underlying aetiology is <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is important not only for prognostic reasons but in order to detect potentially reversible causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In cases of an atypical dementing illness our proposed investigations may assist in confirming or excluding underlying Creutzfeltd-Jakob disease </plain></SENT>
