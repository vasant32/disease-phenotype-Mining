<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The late component of the event-related potential (ERP), P300 is a marker for cognitive brain functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to examine P300 parameters in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and in mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI), to examine whether there is a correlation between the changes in P300 parameters and the type and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and to determine P300 abnormalities in MCI in relation to the presence/absence of CT/MRI abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Auditory event-related potentials, P300 were recorded in 28 MCI patients (14 of them with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CT/MRI findings and 10 subjects with mild ventricular enlargement) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In another group of patients, 31 demented patients were examined, of whom 17 patients were diagnosed with Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD), and 14 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty healthy volunteers served as the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean P300 latency was significantly increased for both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patient-groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that prolongation of P300 latency was correlated with the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean P300 amplitude was significantly decreased in both groups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In MCI, the mean latency of P300 was significantly longer among patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> compared to control volunteers and no significant changes were found for MCI patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CT/MRI findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean P300 amplitude was decreased only in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prolongation of P300 latency was significant among patients with both vascular and Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and also among MCI patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is positively correlated with P300 latency; however, this prolongation is independent of the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The structural brain changes in MCI are related to P300 latency prolongation and thus may indicate an increased risk for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in MCI patients </plain></SENT>
