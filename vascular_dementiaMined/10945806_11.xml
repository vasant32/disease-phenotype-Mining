<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Repetitive speech phenomena are morphologically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> iterations of speech which have been described in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> such as vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia, progressive</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270920" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">supranuclear palsy</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="WD|WND">Wilson's disease</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e>, and which are presently only poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present, prospective study investigated repetitive speech phenomena in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> to describe their <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, assess their prevalence, and to establish their relation with neuropsychological and clinical background data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty four patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> and 29 subjects with mid-stage, stable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277553" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">idiopathic disease</z:e> were screened for appearance, forms, and frequency of repetitive speech phenomena, and underwent a neuropsychological screening procedure comprising tests of general mental functioning, divergent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233629" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">thinking</z:e> and memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> had a significantly higher disease impairment, longer disease duration, and an unstable motor response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15765">levodopa</z:chebi> with frequent on-off fluctuations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both groups were well matched as to their demographical, clinical, and cognitive background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perceptual speech evaluation was used to count and differentiate forms of repetitive speech phenomena in different speech tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To compare the effect of the motor state, the appearance of repetitive speech phenomena was also assessed in a subgroup of patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> during the on versus the off state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Speech repetitions emerged mainly in two variants, one hyperfluent, formally resembling palilalia, and one dysfluent, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038131,C0038506" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Sign or Symptom" abbrv="">stuttering</z:e>-like </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both forms were present in each patient producing repetitive speech phenomena </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The repetitive speech phenomena appeared in 15 patients (28.3 %), 13 of whom belonged to the advanced disease group, indicating a significant preponderance of repetitive speech phenomena in patients with a long term, fluctuating disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Repetitive speech phenomena appeared with almost equal frequency during the on and the off state of patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Their distribution among different variants of speech was disproportional, with effort demanding speech tasks producing a significantly higher number of repetitive speech phenomena over semiautomatic forms of speech </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">idiopathic Parkinson's disease</z:e> repetitive speech phenomena seem to emerge predominantly in a subgroup of patients with advanced disease impairment; manifest <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is not a necessary prerequisite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>They seem to represent a deficit of motor speech control; however, linguistic factors may also contribute to their generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that repetitions of speech in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> represent a distinctive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002167'>speech disorder</z:hpo>, which is caused by changes related to the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
