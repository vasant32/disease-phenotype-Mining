<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Subjects were 247 individuals representing three diagnostic groups: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), subcortical vascular ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (SVaD), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Individuals were administered a battery of neuropsychological tests, including the MMSE, as part of a comprehensive evaluation for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurologic disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MMSE performance differed among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The three-item free recall performance also differed among groups, with post hoc analyses revealing the AD and SVaD groups were more impaired than controls but did not differ significantly from each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following a cued recall procedure of the MMSE three-items, groups differed, with post hoc analyses showing that AD patients failed to benefit from cues, whereas SVaD patients performed significantly better and comparable to control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations between the MMSE three-item cued recall performance and other memory measures demonstrated concurrent validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with previous research indicating that SVaD is associated with memory encoding and retrieval deficits, whereas AD is associated with consolidation and storage problems, the present study supported the validity of the cued recall procedure of the three items on the MMSE in helping to distinguish between patients with AD and those with a vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with primarily subcortical pathology; however, despite these findings, a more extensive battery of neuropsychological measures is still recommended to consistently assess subtle diagnostic differences in these memory processes </plain></SENT>
