<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report characteristics of those with mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in a prospective, seven center, clinic-based Canadian study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 1,008 patients, 372 were diagnosed with AD, 149 with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (VCI) including 76 with mixed AD/VaD, and 82 with other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age of patients with mixed AD/VaD was 78.0 +/- 7.6 years; 49% were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These proportions differed significantly between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnosis subgroup (p &lt; 0.001) showing a trend which is evident in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons--AD/VaD patients fall in between AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vascular risk factors were present significantly more often in mixed AD/VaD than in AD (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More mixed AD/VaD (20%) than AD patients (4%) had focal signs, compared with 38% of those with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 12% with other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Between the initial clinical diagnosis and the final diagnosis (which utilized neuroimaging and neuropsychological data) AD/VaD was the least stable diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging of ischemic lesions was the most common reason for reassignment from AD to the mixed AD/VaD diagnosis (17 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that an operational definition of mixed AD/VaD can be proposed on presentation and clinical/radiographic findings, but indifferent to vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The concept of mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> should be extended to include vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in combination with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>, other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
