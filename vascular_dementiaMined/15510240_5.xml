<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lundbeck A/S, Namenda, Forest Laboratories, Inc.) is an uncompetitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> with low to moderate affinity for the (+)MK-801 binding site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is characterized as a voltage-sensitive open-channel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor blocker that antagonizes <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor-mediated inward currents in vitro with an IC50 of 1-3 microM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In animal models, memantine displays both neuroprotective (antiexcitotoxic) and cognition-enhancing properties at therapeutically relevant concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The strong voltage dependency and rapid blocking/unblocking kinetics of memantine are thought to be the basis for its excellent clinical tolerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recently completed clinical studies demonstrate positive effects of memantine in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> both as a monotherapy and in patients receiving continuous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Memantine treatment also has demonstrated significant improvement of cognitive performance in patients suffering from vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the safety and tolerability of memantine in clinical trials has been excellent, with the incidence of premature withdrawals due to adverse events no greater than placebo and overall low frequencies of total adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 2002, memantine was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) for the treatment of moderately severe to severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More recently, memantine was approved in the US for the treatment of moderate to severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (October 2003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Here, we review the most recent pharmacological and clinical data in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients that has emerged from the systematic evaluation of memantine </plain></SENT>
