<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined patterns of early and late word generation in category and letter fluency among persons in the preclinical stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sample consisted of 20 preclinical VaD persons, 66 preclinical AD persons, and 267 control persons, sampled from the community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Persons in the preclinical phase of AD and VaD were similarly impaired in letter fluency, although the preclinical VaD group outperformed their AD counterparts in category fluency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This pattern of results is consistent with the notion that category fluency is relatively more dependent on the medial-temporal lobe, whereas letter fluency relies more on frontal regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patterns of fluency impairment in preclinical AD and VaD generalized across early and late word retrieval </plain></SENT>
