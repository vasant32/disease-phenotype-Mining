<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To present the case of a woman with a probable vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and a unique oral spelling behavior (OSB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to better characterize the mechanisms underlying OSB in this patient with advanced cognitive and noncognitive deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Different kind of language deficits have been described in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> and other related diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other nonaphasic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751047" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">acquired communication disorders</z:e> include a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of verbal impairment that are mainly due to attentional and executive impairments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We describe the neurolinguistic and neuropsychologic analysis of an 88-year-old woman with spontaneous OSB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography-scan at the time of the clinical analysis is also presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: OSB occurred preferentially in spontaneous discourse, manifested in other language tasks, concerned <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lexical categories, and was not accompanied by spelling deficit although language was not intact and disclosed foreign accent syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Environmental dependency syndrome or utilization behavior was prominent and concerned various sensorimotor activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We postulate that OSB was not secondary to a linguistic or more specifically to a spelling deficit but to another variant of environmental dependency syndrome and probably associated with a cortico-subcortical lesion including the left prefrontal region </plain></SENT>
