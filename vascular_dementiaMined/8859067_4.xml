<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To provide methods to interpret and compare different neurobehavioral screening tests for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Five mental-status neuropsychological tools for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> screening were administered to patients in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025261" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory disorder</z:e> clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These included the Mini-Mental State Examination, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating Scale, the 6-item derivative of the Orientation-memory-Concentration Test, a short Mental Status Questionnaire, and a composite tool we labeled the Ottawa Mental Status Examination, which assessed orientation, memory, attention, language, and visual-constructive functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: To obtain z and percentile scores, norms are for the different tests, computed separately for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer type, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, or no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Another set of norms is reported in which a test score is translated directly into the posttest probability of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Translation formulas are given to allow the estimation of the score on one test from the result on another test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The interpretation of tests used to diagnose <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> must be based on an understanding of the meaning of an individual score, which is based on the question asked and the population to which the patient is referenced </plain></SENT>
