<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This article examines the relationships between behaviour, psychological functioning, the caring environment and subsequent institutionalization in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> living at home with a carer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Longitudinal study of behaviour in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, with a nested case-control study to investigate predictors of institutionalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, known to service, living at home with a carer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lived in Oxfordshire, UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: 100 people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and/or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) who were living at home with a carer at the start of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASURES: At 4-monthly intervals, the carers were interviewed and the subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were assessed cognitively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects' behaviour and psychological functioning were assessed using the Present Behavioural Examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The characteristics which best predicted institutionalization 1 year later were: excessive night-time activity; immobility or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002355'>difficulty in walking</z:hpo>; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">incontinence</z:e>; being away from a carer for more than 16 hours a week; and being cared for by a female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>Aggressive behaviour</z:hpo> was not associated with an increased chance of entry into an institution 1 year later, although it was more prevalent 4 months before entering an institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both behaviour and psychological functioning and the caring environment can help in predicting which patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> currently living at home will enter an institution 1 year later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These predictors are not the same as those which are the immediate cause of institutionalization </plain></SENT>
