<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients met criteria for probable Alzheimer' s disease (AD), 19 for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), and 12 were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The use of standard cutpoints resulted in poor to good classification accuracy for the three measures, but measurable improvement in sensitivity was obtained by adjusting the cutpoints for each measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Discriminatory power was maximized with an MMSE cutpoint of &lt; or = 26, an MDRS cutpoint of &lt; or = 134, and requiring one or more NCSE subtests to be in the impaired range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Use of age and education adjusted norms resulted in good to excellent classification accuracy for the MMSE and MDRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The NCSE subtest score pattern failed to differentiate between AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
