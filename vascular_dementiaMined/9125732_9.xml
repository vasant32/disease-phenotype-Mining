<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Assessment and measurement of neuropsychiatric disturbances are indispensable to the management of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and for clinical research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No standardized instruments have been developed for these purposes in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), developed by Cummings et al., is a standardized, validated, and reliable tool to assess a wide range of neuropsychiatric derangements in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and has been used in clinical studies in North America </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we prepared a Japanese version of the NPI and tested its reliability and usefulness in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The subjects were 174 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (140), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (12), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (19), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (3), whose diagnosis was made on the basis of the results of extensive examinations including MRI and PET/SPECT of the brain and appropriate clinical diagnostic criteria for each disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The subjects consisted of 133 women and 41 men; their mean age was 72.6 +/- 7.7 years (S.D.; range: 49 to 88) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An examiner (neurologist) used the NPI to interview a caregiver familiar with the patient's everyday behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 24 randomly selected patients interview was repeated by another examiner (psychiatrist) one month later, and test-retest reliability was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating (CDR), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Assessment Scale (ADAS) were used to assess the severity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The MMSE scores ranged from 5 to 29 (mean +/- SD = 19.0 +/- 4.8) and the ADAS scores ranged from 7 to 63 (24.3 +/- 10.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The CDR score was 0.5 in 17 patients, 1 in 95 patients, 2 in 52 patients, and 3 in 10 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Test-retest reliability of each score was acceptably high, and the correlation coefficient for each score obtained by repeated assessments in this study was similar to the coefficient in the original report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>Apathy</z:hpo> was the most common behavior in the ten abnormal behavioral domains, and euphoria was the least common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of abnormal findings was also comparable to the results in the original report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The total NPI scores and many of the NPI subscale scores were significantly correlated with both the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This Japanese version of NPI, whose reliability and competency are comparable to those of the original version, is a reliable and useful tool for measuring neuropsychiatric disturbances in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
