<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Astaxanthin is a natural <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="23044">carotenoid</z:chebi> that occurs in a wide variety of living organisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated, for the first time, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> effects of astaxanthin (ASX-O) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oral administration of ASX-O for 14 d induced a significant reduction in the arterial blood pressure (BP) in SHR but not in normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The long-term administration of ASX-O (50 mg/kg) for 5 weeks in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prone SHR (SHR-SP) induced a significant reduction in the BP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It also delayed the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the SHR-SP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To investigate the action mechanism of ASX-O, the effects on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26340">PGF</z:chebi>(2alpha)-induced contractions of rat aorta treated with NG-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> (L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e>) were studied in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ASX-O (1 to 10 microM) induced vasorelaxation mediated by nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> effect of ASX-O may be due to a NO-related mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ASX-O also showed significant neuroprotective effects in ischemic mice, presumably due to its <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of the mice with ASX-O significantly shortened the latency of escaping onto the platform in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> learning performance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these results indicate that astaxanthin can exert beneficial effects in protection against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and in improving memory in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
