<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present investigation examined the validity of the revised Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT-R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a principal components analysis with varimax rotation, measures of new learning and delayed recall loaded on a single factor distinguishable from measures related to general cognitive function and visual memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The HVLT-R also correlated most strongly with other tests of verbal memory and relatively weakly with a test of general intelligence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group comparisons showed that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls performed better than age- and education-matched patients with probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Discriminant function analyses and Bayesian statistics revealed high classification accuracies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients versus controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When scores on the HVLT-R and other neuropsychological tests were subjected to discriminant function analyses, performance on the HVLT-R delayed recognition task was found to be the most useful in discriminating patients with AD from those with VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the HVLT-R is a valid test of verbal learning and memory that is best suited for use with elderly patients suspected of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
