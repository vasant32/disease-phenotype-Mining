<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: cerebral white matter lesions are commonly seen on neuroimaging in older people and have been associated with clinical features such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait abnormalities</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The significance of cerebral white matter lesions in older people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: to study the association between cerebral white matter lesions and the presence or absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in a group of elderly Asian patients; and to determine the clinical significance of cerebral white matter lesions in patients who are diagnosed to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in terms of associated clinical features and the impact of cerebral white matter lesions on cognitive status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: for the first objective, the records of 141 older people of Asian ethnicity presenting to a memory clinic for the evaluation of suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were reviewed to compare the prevalence of cerebral white matter lesions in patients who did not fulfil the criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, patients diagnosed to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and patients diagnosed to have vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the second objective, 115 of these patients who were diagnosed to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were studied to determine if <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients with cerebral white matter lesions were more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>Parkinsonism</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and greater severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, a comparison was made between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients with cerebral white matter lesions and those without cerebral white matter lesions in terms of psychometric assessment scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: cerebral white matter lesions were more common in Asian patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Demented</z:e> patients with cerebral white matter lesions were also found to have more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and greater functional disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: cerebral white matter lesions are common, and are associated with greater functional disability in elderly Asian patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
