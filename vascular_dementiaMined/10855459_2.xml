<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 196 patients entered the study, 147 patients completed treatment in adherence with the protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome measures were the cognitive score of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog), the subscale Instrumental Activities of Daily Living of the Nurses' Observation Scale for Geriatric Patients (NOSGER-IADL) and the Clinical Global Impressions of Change (CGI-C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Safety assessments included adverse events, vital signs, ECG and clinical laboratory parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy results based on a multi-level responder analysis including ADAS-Cog, NOSGER-IADL and CGI-C failed to demonstrate statistical superiority of cyclandelate in comparison to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The direction of changes favored cyclandelate in each of the variables, but the differences to placebo were small and varied considerably between patients and centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Retrospective exploratory analyses suggested that efficacy of cyclandelate might be dependent on the severity of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The treatment effects in favor of cyclandelate were statistically significant in the subgroup of moderately impaired patients (MMSE at baseline &lt;18) for ADAS-Cog (delta = -4.0 points, p = 0.015) and CGI-C (delta = -0.4 points, p = 0.043) but not for NOSGER-IADL (delta = -1.6 points, p = 0.059) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When patients were stepwise selected for the severity of the disease according to ADAS-Cog at baseline (&gt;15, &gt;20, &gt;25 points), statistical significance was reached for ADAS-Cog and NOSGER-IADL beginning with the step ADAS-Cog &gt;20 points: delta ADAS-Cog = -3.9 points, p = 0.044; delta NOSGER-IADL = -1.0, p = 0.023 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The treatment differences increased further with the step ADAS-Cog &gt;25 points: delta ADAS-Cog = -7.0 points, p = 0.008; delta NOSGER-IADL = -1.7, p = 0.003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment differences in CGI-C increased marginally with the stepwise selection but did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The drug was safe and well tolerated </plain></SENT>
