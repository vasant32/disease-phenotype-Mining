<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was found that the Apo E epsilon 4 allele were associated with an increased prevalence of AD as previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although, it was not strongly related to the severity of senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, a weak association between the ApoE genotype and the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients with senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was higher in the group of carriers of MTHFR mutation than in the group of noncarriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the proportion of male patients with senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was higher in the group of homozygous for the mutation (+/+) than the group without the mutation (-/-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Notably in VD patients, 5 of 7 males had the +/+ genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the ApoE epsilon 4 genotype and the MTHFR mutation are associated with the clinical phenotype and the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
