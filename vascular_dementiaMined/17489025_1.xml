<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the need of institutional care for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, we investigated the institution prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed stratified randomized sampling of elder residents from different types of institutions in different regions of Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 2-stage survey with screening and clinical confirmation was carried out in 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 1,525 residents aged 65 years and over in 60 institutions participated in the study in which 1,308 elders completed the 2-stage survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among these, 631 elders were diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> prevalence was 26.8% in the residential houses, 61.8% in the assisted living facilities and 64.5% in the nursing homes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was the leading cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Old age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> increased risks for both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The investigation showed that the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the long-term care units of Taiwan was much higher than those from community studies and the high prevalence in the institutions depended on the type of the long-term care unit </plain></SENT>
