<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: While the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) increases with age, little is known about the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>) in the oldest old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A retrospective hospital-based study compared the relative prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> among very old individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 1,100 consecutive autopsy cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients aged over 70 years (mean age: 83.9 Â± 5.4 years) were examined using standardized neuropathological methods and current diagnostic consensus criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Evaluation of three age groups (8th-10th decade) showed a significant increase in the relative prevalence of AD with cerebrovascular lesions including mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, while AD with Lewy body (LB) pathology showed a mild but insignificant age-related increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both 'pure' AD and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> showed a mild but insignificant decline, while <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> (without severe AD pathology) decreased progressively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While the severity of Lewy pathology in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> slightly decreased with age, concomitant Alzheimer-like pathology increased progressively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> in the oldest old represents a distinct group is a matter of discussion, but the relative prevalence of AD with LB in our sample remained fairly stable </plain></SENT>
