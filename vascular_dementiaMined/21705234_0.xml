<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several studies have analyzed the perception of activities of daily living (ADL) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients based on the discrepancy between scores given by the patients and their caregivers, and the results have been controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate the discrepancy between self-rating of ADL in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) patients and evaluation by caregivers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that patients with right hemisphere damage (RHD) would overrate themselves on the Barthel Index (BI) compared to those with left hemisphere damage (LHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty VaD patients, including 30 each with damage to the left and right hemispheres, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BI was used to evaluate ADL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The self-rating BI score was based on an interview of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference between these score was used as a measure of overrating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean BI score for LHD patients was higher than that for RHD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although there was no significant difference in the self-rated BI scores between the 2 groups, the difference between self-rated BI and BI was significantly larger in RHD patients: 6 patients had damage to the right insular cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional analysis for 7 RHD and 7 LHD patients by matching the BI and Mini-Mental State Examination scores disclosed that the difference remained larger in the RHD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RHD patients had a higher self-rating for their ADL scores compared to the rating given by caregivers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is possible that the patients overrated their capability because they were unable to imagine risks such as a fall because of right insular damage </plain></SENT>
