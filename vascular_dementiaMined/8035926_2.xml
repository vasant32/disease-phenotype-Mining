<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To study the temporal aspect of visual processing of senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer type (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e>), we recorded the steady-state visual evoked potentials (VEPs) to LED goggle stimulation at five different temporal frequencies in 14 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> and 14 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For comparison, we also studied 14 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were women, and their ages were closely matched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Temporal frequencies were 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 Hz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The steady-state VEPs were Fourier analyzed, and both the amplitude and phase of the first and second harmonic responses were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in the amplitude across the three groups for stimulation at 15, 20, and 30 Hz, but no difference at a stimulation of 5 and 10 Hz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple comparison tests revealed that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> had a significantly smaller amplitude than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with VD had lower amplitudes than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, but this was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the phase data, there were also no statistically significant differences across the three groups for any of the temporal frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that a temporal frequency deficit exists in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon may be explained by the pathology that affects the early stage of visual signal processing </plain></SENT>
