<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied 21 patients, from 18 families, with L-2-hydroxyglutaric <z:hpo ids='HP_0012072'>aciduria</z:hpo> (L-2-HGA), a rare neurometabolic disorder with a homogeneous presentation: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>progressive neurodegeneration</z:hpo> with extrapyramidal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001317'>cerebellar signs</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, and subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased levels of L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid in body fluids proved the diagnosis of L-2-HGA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 21 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the L-2-HGA gene (L2HGDH), recently found to be mutated in consanguineous families with L-2-HGA, and identified seven novel mutations in 15 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three mutations appeared to be particularly prevalent in this Portuguese panel: a frameshift mutation (c.529delC) was detected in 12 out of 30 mutant alleles (40%), a nonsense mutation (c.208C&gt;T; p.Arg70X) in 7/30 alleles (23%), and a missense mutation (c.293A&gt;G; p.His98Arg) in four out of 30 mutant alleles (13%), suggesting that common origin may exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, two novel missense (c.169G&gt;A; p.Gly57Arg, c.1301A&gt;C; p.His434Pro) and two splice error (c.257-2A&gt;G, c.907-2A&gt;G) mutations were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the mutations presumably lead to loss-of-function with no relationship between clinical signs, progression of the disease, levels of L-2-HGA and site of the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the three remaining families, no pathogenic mutations in the L-2-HGA were found, which suggests either alterations in regulatory regions of the gene or of its intervening sequences, compound heterozygosity for large genomic deletion and, or further <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
