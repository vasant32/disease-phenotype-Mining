<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This is a study on the heredity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the ageing of the Alzheimer, vascular and Pick types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of the same type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> among parents, siblings and offspring of the probands is higher than that in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alzheimer <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD): Presenile familial AD follows a dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo>: many pedigrees with numerous cases in successive generations, and higher incidence of AD among the parents than among the siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Senile familial AD seems to follow a recessive mode: pedigree with 2 or more cases usually in only one generation, and higher incidence of AD among the siblings than among the parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Yet presenile and senile AD cases are sometimes found in the same family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The heredity factors involved in AD may be partially common for the presenile and senile forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD): In families of VD probands, the incidence of VD and brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> is higher in parents than in siblings, and familial vascular cases are more numerous in two generations than in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A familial diathesis seems to exist for VD, following a dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pick <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>): The form of brain lobar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo>, argyrophilic inclusions (AI) and/or ballooned neurons (BN), when it is familial, follows a dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo>: many pedigrees with numerous cases in successive generations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> without AI or BN, but with only <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo>, when it is familial, seems to follow a recessive mode: some pedigrees with 2 or more cases in only one generation </plain></SENT>
