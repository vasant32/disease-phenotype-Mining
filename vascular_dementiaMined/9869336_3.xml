<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An animal model of graded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> achieved by way of 2- and 4-brain vessel occlusion (vo) was used to test the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> propentofylline (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi>) administration on hippocampal energy state and amyloid precursor protein (APP) concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, forty adult rats were subjected to stepwise and permanent 2 vo and 4 vo and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> in a dose of 25 mg/day per kilogram body weight was continuously administered intraperitoneally for 1 week or 3 weeks, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the final steady-state experiment arterial blood parameters and blood gases (mean arterial blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi>, pCO2, pH, hematocrit, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, body temperature) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain tissue concentrations of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>), and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> were measured in rat hippocampus by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis; APP concentration was determined using Western blot techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In adult rat brain, long-term <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> treatment induced a striking increase in hippocampal ATP concentration which was paralleled by an enhancement of the ATP/<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specifically, after 2 vo with 1 week of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> treatment the ATP concentration in hippocampus was enhanced by 18% when compared with 2 vo without <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> treatment, whereas after 3 weeks <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> administration with 4 vo the concentration of ATP was enhanced by 31% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> reduced the tissue concentration of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> from 17.75 +/- 2.79 to 8.83 +/- 3.68 pmol/mg wet weight during 4 vo if compared with animals without <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the APP concentration was enhanced by 35% after 1 week <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> administration when compared with non <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, the results demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> administration of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> induced an enhancement in ATP concentration in adult rat hippocampus under conditions of long-term brain vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, 1 week <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> seems to have a stimulating effect on APP which may act neuroprotectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> may protect hippocampal neurons from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> may have some beneficial effects and could be used in the treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cerebrovascular disorders or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> such as vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
