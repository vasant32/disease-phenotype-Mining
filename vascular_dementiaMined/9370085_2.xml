<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum alpha 1-ACT was also characterized by <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> PAGE electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Western blot and computer-assisted optical density reading (OD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a polyclonal affinity-purified antibody specific for human alpha 1-ACT, one band with the apparent MW of 60 and another with 180 kD in sera from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects were clearly detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OD of both alpha 1-ACT bands from patients with l-AD was higher than that from VD patients, the 180-kD form being 2.65 times higher than that observed from patients with VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase proteins from l-AD were comparable to those observed in VD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A slight but nonstatistical increment of serum IL-6 was noted in patients with l-AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum alpha 1-ACT was purified from 3 of these l-AD patients by a two-step affinity chromatography technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After Western blot, purified alpha 1-ACT showed two or three different bands which immune-reacted with an antibody specific for alpha 1-ACT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The apparent MWs were 60, 120 and 180 kD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In human sera the serpin was present mainly in a monomeric form, but it could also form <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> stable dimers and trimers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both monomeric and <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> stable polymeric forms of alpha 1-ACT appeared to be increased in sera from patients with l-AD </plain></SENT>
