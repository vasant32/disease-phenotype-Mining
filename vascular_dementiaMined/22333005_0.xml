<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">Antipsychotics</z:chebi> (APs) are usually prescribed to deal with behavioral and psychological symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (BPSD), but poor outcomes, important side effects, and high mortality risk should be addressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of AP consumption in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and to describe and compare the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients consuming APs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study using 1,894 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> registered from 2007 to 2009 by the Registry of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementias</z:hpo> of Girona (ReDeGi), which is a population-based passive surveillance system of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>APs were categorized according to the anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) classification, and grouped as typical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi> (TAPs) or atypical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi> (AAPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Binary logistic regression analyses were used to detect the predictors of AP use as well as the variables associated with TAP or AAP prescription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: APs were used in 29.6% of the cases, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242422" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Parkinsonian syndromes</z:e> (PSd) being the subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with the highest AP prescription (50.6% of the patients with PSd) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AAPs were mainly prescribed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, except in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) and PSd, where no preference in TAP or AAP use was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033975,C0459435" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Finding" abbrv="">Psychotic</z:e> antecedents, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>) diagnoses, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, and BPSD were AP use predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AAP use was related to higher severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite their disputed benefit-risk ratios, APs are extensively used, off-label, to treat BPSD, and AAPs are more commonly prescribed than TAPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>AP consumption was frequent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>, and was related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity indicators </plain></SENT>
