<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previous studies demonstrated that SeGb and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45980">tacrine</z:chebi> induce significant pharmacological effects on the brains of young, healthy human males, as determined by bioelectrical activity measurements obtained using the quantitative pharmaco-electroencephalogram (QPEEG) method </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine whether EGb or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45980">tacrine</z:chebi> had noticeable pharmacological effects on elderly subjects diagnosed with possible or probable Alzheimer's, the present open, uncontrolled trial was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data from 18 subjects (11 males, 7 females) at an average age of 67.4 years with light to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (Mini Mental mean score = 23.7, ranges: 15-29 [Geriatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale mean scores = 3.7; range: 3.2-5.4]) were analyzed for this presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Each subject was randomly administered a single oral "Test-Dose" of either 40 mg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45980">tacrine</z:chebi> or 240 mg of EGb2 in two separate sessions within 3- to 7-day intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Before drug administration and at 1- and 3-hour intervals after drug administration, CEEGs were recorded for a minimum of 10 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The CEEGs were analyzed using Period Analysis programs we developed for QPEEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that both EGb and, to a lesser degree, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45980">tacrine</z:chebi> induced pharmacological effects, as established by QPEEG measurements, in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> similar to those previously established in healthy, young subjects </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results also showed that 240 mg of EGb has typical cognitive activator CEEG profiles (responders) in more subjects (8 of 18) than 40 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45980">tacrine</z:chebi> (3 of 18 subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Because of the small sample size, we could not test the hypothesis that subjects who showed cognitive activator-type pharmacological response to the first Test-Dose of EGb or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45980">tacrine</z:chebi> also exhibit more therapeutic effects (compared to nonresponders) when drugs are administered chronically </plain></SENT>
