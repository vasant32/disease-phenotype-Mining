<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pharmacological effects of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> may be exerted via the stimulation of nerve growth factor, increased cerebral blood flow, and inhibition of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this experiment are to determine the kinetic behavior of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi>, to identify, and to quantify its metabolite in human </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were obtained from human volunteers following oral administration of 200 mg of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> tablets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the identification and quantification of the metabolite, 3-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-1-(5-hydroxyhexyl)-7-propylxanthine (PPFOH), PPFOH was synthesized and identified by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) and 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The molecular weight of synthesized metabolite is 308 dalton </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> and PPFOH in plasma were extracted with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35702">diethyl ether</z:chebi> and identified by electron impact GC/MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The plasma concentrations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> and PPFOH were determined by gas chromatography/nitrogen <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi> detector in plasma and their pharmacokinetic parameters were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean half-life of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> was 0.74 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The areas under the curve (AUCs) of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> and PPFOH were 508 and 460 ng.hr/ml, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cmax of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> was about 828.4 ng/ml and the peak concentration was achieved at about 2.2 hr (Tmax) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> is rapidly disappeared from blood due to extensive metabolism into PPFOH </plain></SENT>
