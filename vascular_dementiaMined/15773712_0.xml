<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, its clinical role in the detection of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and its correlations with other cognitive processes is still under investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is an uncertain nosological entity, in which unevenly distributed patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> comprising slowing of cognitive processing and impairment of executive function occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study assessed how the Clock Test scores correlated with a number of other neuropsychological and functional tests in a sample of 144 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, who were followed for a period of 24 mo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At baseline, at 12 mo. and at 24 mo. subjects were administered a battery of tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination, word fluency, visuospatial skills, an evaluation of hetero- and autotopognosia (knowledge of self), the Proverbs Test, and the Ten-point Clock Test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For these patients scores on the Clock Test correlated significantly with semantic abilities, with abstract reasoning capacities, visuospatial perception, and with right and left recognition </plain></SENT>
