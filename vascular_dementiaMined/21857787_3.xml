<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We reviewed 143 papers that described the relationship between moderate drinking of alcohol and some aspect of cognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two types of papers were found: (1) those that provided ratios of risk between drinkers and nondrinkers (74 papers in total) and (2) those that, although they did not provide such ratios, allowed cognition in drinkers to be rated as "better," "no different," or "worse" than cognition in nondrinkers (69 papers in total) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The history of research on moderate drinking and cognition can be divided into two eras: 1977-1997 and 1998-present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phase I (1977-1997) was the era of neuropsychological evaluation involving mostly young to middle-aged (18-50 years old) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although initial studies indicated moderate drinking <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">impaired cognition</z:e>, many later studies failed to confirm this, instead finding no difference in cognition between drinkers and nondrinkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phase II (1998-present) was and is the era of mental status exam evaluation involving mostly older (â‰¥55 years old) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies overwhelmingly found that moderate drinking either reduced or had no effect on the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the ratios of risk from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the studies in phase II providing such ratios are entered into a comprehensive meta-analysis, the average ratio of risk for cognitive risk (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>/decline) associated with moderate "social" (not alcoholic) drinking of alcohol is 0.77, with nondrinkers as the reference group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The benefit of moderate drinking applied to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> unspecified, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) and to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (low test scores), but no significant benefit against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> (rate of decline in test scores) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both light and moderate drinking provided a similar benefit, but <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0687132" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">heavy drinking</z:e> was associated with nonsignificantly higher cognitive risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the meta-analysis also indicated that wine was better than beer or spirits, this was based on a relatively small number of studies because most studies did not distinguish among these different types of alcohol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a number of the studies that did make the distinction reported no difference among the effects of these different types of alcohol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, at present this question remains unanswered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Analysis also showed that the presence of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E epsilon 4 allele eliminated the benefit of moderate drinking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, this was based on a relatively small number of studies and several other studies have found a beneficial effect of the epsilon e4 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further studies are necessary to settle this question </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The benefit of moderate alcohol for cognition was seen in both men and women, although the amount and pattern of drinking is very different between the two sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Lastly, the finding of unaffected or significantly reduced cognitive risk in light to moderate drinkers was seen in 14/19 countries for which country-specific ratio data were available, with three of the five remaining countries showing nonsignificant reductions as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Overall, light to moderate drinking does not appear to impair cognition in younger subjects and actually seems to reduce the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in older subjects </plain></SENT>
