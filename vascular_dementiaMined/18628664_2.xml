<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An accelerated shortening of the telomeres has been linked to several age-related disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the relative length of telomeres could discriminate between patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A quantitative real-time PCR method was used to calculate the relative telomere length in 76 age-matched and sex-matched, newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> AD or VaD patients recruited from our Memory Unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found in the relative telomere length between AD and VaD cases neither in men (P=0.315) nor women (P=0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, we could not confirm that the length of telomeres would predict which form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> AD or VaD that develops </plain></SENT>
