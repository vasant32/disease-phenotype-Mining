<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In the general population, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, cerebrovascular diseases, and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> differ in many aspects between men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CADASIL is considered a unique model to investigate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>migraine with aura</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> related to ischemic small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aims to evaluate the effect of gender on the main clinical and neuroimaging characteristics of CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cross-sectional data from 313 CADASIL patients including various clinical and cognitive scores and MRI parameters were compared between men and women, and between those younger and older than the median age of the population corresponding to the usual age of menopause (51 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At younger than 51 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>migraine with aura</z:hpo> was 50% more prevalent in women and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 75% more prevalent in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the fifth decade, men had higher National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale and Rankin scores than women and more severe executive dysfunction, although global cognitive scores were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age at first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> events, and the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852553" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychiatric symptoms</z:e> did not differ between men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain volume was lower in men with a trend for a larger volume of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In CADASIL, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>migraine with aura</z:hpo> is more frequent in women and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is more frequent in men before the age of menopause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This difference seems to vanish after this age limit but may result in a higher degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> in men at the late stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presumable role of ovarian hormones in these gender-related differences remains to be explored </plain></SENT>
