<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess the therapeutic efficacy and safety of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">haloperidol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> in treating BPSD in Chinese <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 12-week double-blind randomised comparison of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">haloperidol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> treatments was conducted in 58 patients with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer's type or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were randomly assigned to receive flexible doses (0.5 to 2 mg/day) of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">haloperidol</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical response was evaluated using the Cohen-Mansfield <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>Agitation</z:hpo> Inventory (CMAI), the Behavioral Pathology in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD), Simpson-Angus Scale, Functional Assessment Staging and Cantonese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean doses at the last week were 0.90 mg/day of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">haloperidol</z:chebi> and 0.85 mg/day of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">haloperidol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> significantly reduced the severity of BPSD (scores on CMAI and BEHAVE-AD), with no significant between-group differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">Haloperidol</z:chebi>-treated patients showed a worsening on Simpson-Angus scale while there was no significant change in this measure in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi>-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose <z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">haloperidol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> were well tolerated and associated with reductions in the severity and frequency of behavioural symptoms in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">Risperidone</z:chebi> may have a more favourable risk-benefit profile in view of its lower propensity to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002071'>extrapyramidal symptoms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
