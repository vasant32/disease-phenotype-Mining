<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2753 men and 2544 women from four urban and four rural communities participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their age ranged from 41 to 88 years; 28% of them were at least 65 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their education ranged from 0 to 20 years; 27% of them had less than 1 year of formal schooling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Phase I was a screening survey by trained nurses who administered a Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination, the MMSE-T1, to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phase II involved the assessment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> by neurologists on the 1521 individuals who had scored less than 24 on the 30-point MMSE-T1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-one cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were identified by the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R criteria, including 18 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 10 cases of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and three cases of other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence rate in individuals aged 65 and over was 2.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aging and illiteracy were associated with higher rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; gender and residence location made no difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was low in this Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Consistent with common findings from other parts of the world, a high rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was associated with older age and illiteracy, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> was the most frequent cause </plain></SENT>
