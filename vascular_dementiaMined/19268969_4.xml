<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether quantitative EEG may be useful in differential diagnosis of AD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> and to determine the correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and abnormalities in EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The group under study was consisted of 62 patients with AD (mean age: 73.6 yrs; M 51%), 31 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> (mean age: 75.2 yrs, M 43%) and a control group of 14 healthy subjects (mean age: 69.5 yrs, M 43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into subgroups of those with mild, moderate and marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EEG findings were classified using eight-degree scale according to the presence of slow waves, and then quantitative analysis was carried out by calculating the alpha/slow wave power ratios and the mean frequencies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> and some selected derivations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant difference between visual EEGs and QEEGs in AD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only QEEG parameters differed in AD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> subgroups with the same degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>: the mean wave frequencies of waves in temporal derivations in subgroups with mild and moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and alpha/delta waves power ratio in subgroups with moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Visual EEGs and QEEGs could be used in addition to the differential diagnosis between AD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>, but only selected parameters of QEEG could be useful in differentiating between AD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> subgroups with the same degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
