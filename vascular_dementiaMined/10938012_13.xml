<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with severe MTHFR deficiency, a metabolite(s) other than hyperhomocyst(e)inemia also appears to be associated with its clinical manifestation in cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the specific role of the TT genotype of MTHFR in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, we determined the prevalence of hyperhomocyst(e)inemia and the C677T genotypes of MTHFR in 143 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 122 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, and 217 healthy subjects matched for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of hyperhomocyst(e)inemia [homocyst(e)ine &gt;/=15 micromol/L] was higher in cerebrovascular patients with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects (42.6%, 20.5%, and 10.1%, respectively; P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a higher frequency of MTHFR TT genotype was found only in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients compared with nondemented patients and healthy controls (25.2%, 9.8%, and 12.0%, respectively; P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the study subjects were divided into normohomocyst(e)inemic and hyperhomocyst(e)inemic groups, the TT genotype was significantly associated with the risk for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the hyperhomocyst(e)inemic group (odds ratio 4.13, 95% CI 2.18 to 7.85; P=0.03) but not in the normohomocyst(e)inemic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Demented</z:e> patients with multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> had a higher frequency of TT genotype (odds ratio 3.13, 95% CI 2.23 to 4.39; P=0.0007), whereas those with a single <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> did not (odds ratio 2.03, P=0.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there was no significant association of the TT genotype with multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in hyperhomocyst(e)inemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these findings indicate a possible role of MTHFR TT genotype combined with hyperhomocyst(e)inemia in the pathogenesis of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similar to the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo> due to severe MTHFR deficiency and severe <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17755">cystathionine</z:chebi> beta-synthase deficiency, the TT genotype of MTHFR in hyperhomocyst(e)inemic subjects is differentiated from the cases of the TT genotype without hyperhomocyst(e)inemia or hyperhomocyst(e)inemia without the TT genotype in the development of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
