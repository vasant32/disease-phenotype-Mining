<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Experimental studies suggest that physical activity or exercise can prevent or delay the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of age-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several epidemiologic studies have attempted to address this issue by using widely varying definitions of physical activity as well as differing methods to assess cognitive function or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite the variability in study design, longitudinal studies report that the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> is lower among persons engaging in high levels of physical activity, relative to those engaging in low levels of physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is also evidence of a dose-response relationship between physical activity and preservation of cognitive function, even though small increases in physical activity from a sedentary state can reap comparatively large incremental benefits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reductions in the relative risk of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> associated with physical activity were weaker and more variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although many studies had a follow-up duration of around 5 years, at least one study has found evidence that exercise in midlife reduces the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in late life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>How interactions between physical activity and the APOE e4 allele affect the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> is inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The available epidemiologic studies support the concept that physical activity might prevent or delay the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whether that effect will translate into a reduction in the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is unknown </plain></SENT>
