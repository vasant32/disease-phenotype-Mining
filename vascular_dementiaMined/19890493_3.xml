<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These steroids have been shown to be potent neuroprotectants both in vitro and in vivo, and to exert effects that are consistent with their potential use in prevention of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These include the prevention of the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) into beta-amyloid (AÃŸ), the reduction in tau hyperphosphorylation, and the elimination of catastrophic attempts at neuronal mitosis </plain></SENT>
