<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen cases of VD (9 males and 5 females), 18 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer type (DAT)(7 males and 11 females), 29 cases of cerebrovascular disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase (18 males and 11 females) and 47 healthy individuals as controls (25 males and 22 females) were examined for serum Lp(a) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum concentrations and phenotypes of Lp(a) were assessed by ELISA and a test kit for the Lp(a) phenotype, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum concentrations of Lp(a) were significantly higher in patients with VD (p &lt; 0.05) as well as patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> (p &lt; 0.01) compared with those in healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum concentrations of Lp(a) did not significantly differ between patients with DAT and healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidences of Lp(a) phenotypes containing relatively low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) isoforms were significantly higher in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase (p &lt; 0.05) or those with VD (p &lt; 0.01) compared with those in healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Distribution patterns of Lp(a) phenotypes did not differ between patients with DAT and healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, high serum levels of Lp(a) could be considered a clinical hallmark to distinguish VD from DAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Abnormally high serum levels of Lp(a) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and VD seemed to be due to specific increases in low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) isoforms in Lp(a) </plain></SENT>
