<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study reports the unusual writing performance of a 72-year-old woman, Pp, who was unable to maintain her writing within a particular case, and made numerous case mixing errors (e.g. insTEAd) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Her oral spelling was flawless, but when tested using a written spelling task (including words and non-words), a picture description task, a sentence writing task and a transcription task (from upper case to lower case, and vice versa), she showed a high proportion of case mixing errors, though spelling per se was correct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The problem, although less severe, was also present when spelling with letter cards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite a spared ability to select the correct letters in the stimulus, specify the correct number of letters and place them in the correct order, she had a specific problem in selecting the appropriate case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This impairment is indicative of peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0010526'>dysgraphia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She appeared to have intact orthographic representations, but selection of the appropriate allographic codes for upper and lower case was impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Her longitudinal neuropsychological profile and MRI evidence suggest that Pp suffers from mild vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with more severe impairments in attentional functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Her writing deficits may be accounted for by a model that incorporates an inhibitory mechanism, which is responsible for maintaining the appropriate case and inhibiting the inappropriate one, subsequent to case selection in writing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Failure of this mechanism would explain the pattern of case mixing shown by Pp </plain></SENT>
