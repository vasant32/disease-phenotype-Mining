<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to investigate the relationship between plasma fibrinogen level and risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elderly patients with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> were screened and evaluated periodically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred and eighty-five patients who met the criteria for MCI were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood coagulation functions and plasma fibrinogen levels were measured at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hyperfibrinogenaemia was defined as plasma fibrinogen &gt; or =3.0 g/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Global cognitive function was assessed serially with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The enrolled patients were followed for 2 years to observe if <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 185 patients diagnosed as MCI, of which 17 (9.2%) deceased, 15 (8.1%) lost to follow-up, and 68 (36.8%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean of MMSE score of the enrolled patients declined significantly during follow-up (22.0 +/- 3.0 vs. 18.1 +/- 5.8, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with hyperfibrinogenaemia at baseline had greater MMSE decrement during follow-up than patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fibrinogen level (-5.4 +/- 5.4 vs. -3.5 +/- 4.5, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Linear regression indicated that plasma fibrinogen level was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> (R = 0.17, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with hyperfibrinogenaemia had an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> compared with patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level of plasma fibrinogen (log rank test, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a trend that hyperfibrinogenaemia also increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer's type (p = 0.061) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It can be concluded that plasma fibrinogen level may be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>, and hyperfibrinogenaemia may increase risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in patients with MCI </plain></SENT>
