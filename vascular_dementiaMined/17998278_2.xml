<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The study aimed to examine the relationship between spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> (SCE), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>) and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on cerebral MRI in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SCE were identified by transcranial Doppler of the middle cerebral artery for 1 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A "significant" v-aCS (venous-to-arterial circulation shunt indicative of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>; &gt; or =15 embolic signals within 12 cardiac cycles) was detected by intravenous injection of "air in saline" ultrasound contrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Deep white matter hyperintensities (DWMH) and periventricular hyperintensities (PVH) were assessed using Schelten's scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After correction for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, both DWMH and PVH were significantly associated with the presence of a <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> in AD (beta = 0.31, p = 0.02 for DWMH, odds ratio 8.7, p = 0.011 for PVH) but not in VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No consistent relationship was found between SCE and WMH in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In VaD, the severity of DWMH was negatively correlated with SCE (beta = -0.55; p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the presence of a significant venous-to-arterial shunt is associated with more severe DWMH in AD, and may play a part in the aetiology of the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, there is a significant negative correlation between SCE and DWMH in VaD, which supports the hypothesis that VaD may be the result of ischaemic injury, predominantly reflecting embolic aetiology </plain></SENT>
