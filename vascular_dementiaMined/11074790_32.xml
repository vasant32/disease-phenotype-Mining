<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To examine at what doses this <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory drug</z:chebi> effect occurs and whether other medications and/or International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnoses affect the association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Subjects 75 years and older from a random population sample were classified by consensus using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Drug associations with different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with and without the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnoses as well as dosage data were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: The Centre for Education and Research on Aging, Concord Hospital, Concord, Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: The Sydney Older Persons Study recruited 647 subjects (average age, 81 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 163 patients were given diagnoses placing them in different <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> categories and were compared with 373 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 78 had AD without vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 45 had vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (permissive of other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnoses), and 40 had other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnoses (without AD or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fifty drugs or drug groups were subjected to a 2 (drug used vs drug not used) x 4 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and control groups) chi(2) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Drugs with inverse associations were identified and potential confounders (logistic regression) and dosage data (exact small sample 1-tailed tests) analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As expected, there was an inverse association between <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> and aspirin (and unexpectedly <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors</z:chebi>) and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This association was not observed with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or any other diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Analysis showed no evidence for a dosage effect, ie, responses were equivalent for low and high doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study does not support a high-dose anti-inflammatory action of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> or aspirin in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Potential mechanisms for the beneficial effects of these medications are discussed </plain></SENT>
