<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the 3-year incidence of poststroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (PSD) and the influence of prestroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors evaluated prestroke cognitive functions in 202 consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients &gt; or =40 years old using the Informant Questionnaire on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>Cognitive Decline</z:hpo> in the Elderly (IQCODE), with a cut-off of 104 for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six months and then annually after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was reassessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision criteria in survivors who underwent a visit with a neurologist, or on the IQCODE score obtained by telephone contact with the family in survivors who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistics were performed using life-table methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were excluded because of prestroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the 169 remaining patients, the cumulative proportion of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 28.5% at the end of the follow-up period, with most of PSD occurring during the first 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using multivariate analysis, independent predictors of PSD were aging, preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>, severity of deficit at admission, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, and silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Leukoaraiosis was an independent predictor of PSD when prestroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> was not taken into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presumed etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) in two-thirds of patients and AD in one-third </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk of PSD is high, and increased in patients with prestroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>, with about one-third of patients meeting the criteria for AD and two-thirds meeting the criteria for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results confirm that, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, an underlying degenerative pathology may play a role in the development of PSD </plain></SENT>
