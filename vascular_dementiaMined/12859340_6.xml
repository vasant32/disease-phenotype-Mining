<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to observe interaction of brain capillaries and cholinergic neurons in organotypic brain slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was used to visualize brain capillary-like structures (RECA-1 antigen) and cholinergic neurons (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> culture conditions, a very low number of brain capillaries was found in 2- and 4-week-old cortex brain slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment of slices with acidic medium (pH 6) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> (42 degrees C) markedly enhanced the number of brain capillaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incubation with 10 ng/mL vascular endothelial growth factor only <z:mp ids='MP_0005601'>enhanced angiogenesis</z:mp> in more developed slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cholinergic neurons survived in slices of the basal nucleus of Meynert; however, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> markedly decreased their number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In coslices of the basal nucleus of Meynert and cortex (pretreated with acidic medium), a high number of RECA-1-positive capillaries and cholinergic neurons persisted and displayed strong nerve fibre growth of cholinergic fibres into the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that RECA-1-positive capillaries and cholinergic neurons can be studied in slice cultures in the absence of blood perfusion, and that this model could provide a system to study mechanisms involved in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
