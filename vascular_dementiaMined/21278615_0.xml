<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective case note study was undertaken, involving a series of consecutive patients who had undergone DaTSCAN SPECT 12-24 months earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Case notes of 80 patients were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DaTSCAN imaging results were abnormal (indicating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>) in 20 (25%) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (suggesting an alternative diagnosis or absence of disease) in 60 (75%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 20 patients with an abnormal scan, 18 had a postscan working clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> (90%), one had diagnosis of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (5%) and another had no recorded outcome (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight out of the 60 patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> DaTSCAN image result had an alternative clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> (95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consequently, DaTSCAN findings were concordant with the outcome clinical diagnosis in 76 out of the 80 (95%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequent to DaTSCAN SPECT, scan findings and diagnoses were discussed with patients and/or their carers in 94% of cases and subsequent treatment options discussed in 93% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It would seem that DaTSCAN imaging has a marked influence on the working clinical diagnosis and subsequent management of patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
