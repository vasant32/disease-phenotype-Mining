<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In several randomized, double-blind trials of up to 28 weeks' duration in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, Cerebrolysin was superior to placebo in improving global outcome measures and cognitive ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A large, randomized comparison of Cerebrolysin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> or combination therapy showed beneficial effects on global measures and cognition for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three treatment groups compared with baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although not as extensively studied in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, Cerebrolysin has also shown beneficial effects on global measures and cognition in this patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebrolysin was generally well tolerated in clinical trials, with dizziness (or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo>) being the most frequently reported adverse event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although further studies with Cerebrolysin, including longer term trials and further exploration of its use in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37733">cholinesterase inhibitors</z:chebi>, are needed to more clearly determine its place in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, available data suggest that Cerebrolysin is a useful addition to the treatment options available for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
