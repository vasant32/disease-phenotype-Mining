<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether an early diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is established, whether a differentiation is made between vascular and primary degenerative etiology, and whether treatable causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are considered in primary care, we performed a survey using three written sample case histories describing slight <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> (case 1) or moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (case 2a: vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; case 2: degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer type) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The combinations 1 and 2a or 1 and 2b were randomly assigned and presented to ambulatory-care physicians (145 general practitioners and primary care internists and 14 neuropsychiatrists in private practice) in GÃ¶ttingen and rural surroundings by a trained investigator who then performed a standardized interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study was representative (response rate 83.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the sample case with slight memory complaints 13.8% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> physicians arrived at a primary diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and 44.0% considered <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> for differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer type was considered less often </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the sample cases with moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> according to established scientific criteria, there was a striking under-diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and in both cases an over-diagnosis of underlying vascular etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatable causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, such as possible drug interactions and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740858" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">substance abuse</z:e>, were considered only by a minority of physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> seem to be regarded mainly as consequences of disturbed cerebral perfusion, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and drug adverse effects seem to be under-diagnosed in primary care </plain></SENT>
