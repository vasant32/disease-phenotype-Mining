<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> among persons born in the year 1930 or before, who were living in Granarolo, Ravenna province, on December 31, 1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Population study, carried out in two phases: in the first was phase <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> persons were administered two screening tests for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the second phase, persons who screened positive underwent detailed clinical and cognitive assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) were administered as screening tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the second phase the screened-positive subjects underwent a general and neurological examination, and a detailed neuropsychological assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 557 participants, 56 were clinically diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine persons were diagnosed as affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and 14 patients by vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The crude prevalence ratios for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were 9.1% (95% C.I. = 5.29-12.89) for men and 12.7% (95% C.I. = 8.84-16.6) for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>, as well as AD, increased steeply every five years of age for both men and women up to 90 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Women had higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> and AD than men, more evident in the advanced ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are in agreement with similar studies carried out in European populations, showing that prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> increases with increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>If we consider that in Italy the oldest (those 80 years and older) are the fastest growing part of the elderly population, we can expect that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> will be a major emerging public health problem, as it is one of the most common diseases in the very elderly and a major cause of disability and mortality </plain></SENT>
