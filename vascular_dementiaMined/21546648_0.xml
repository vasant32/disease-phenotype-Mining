<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was a hospital-based MRI300 study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recruited patients newly diagnosed with mild-to-moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> caused either by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> or subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> from 13 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> clinics at university or general hospitals in South Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We enrolled 289 patients aged over 50 from August 2007 to March 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared cognition, ADLs, and neuropsychiatric symptoms among 3 groups according to the severities of PWMHs and DWMHs, respectively, by adjusting for age, vascular risk factors, and level of other WMHs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A higher severity of PWMHs was related to lower cognitive function and severer neuropsychiatric symptoms, whereas basic ADLs were associated with DWMH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both PWMHs and DWMHs exhibited different associations with cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and daily activities </plain></SENT>
