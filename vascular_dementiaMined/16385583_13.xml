<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This rarefaction has been known to be associated with microglial activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi>, a microglial inhibitor, attenuates the white matter damage induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> that is used as a model of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats were subjected to bilateral, permanent occlusion of the common carotid arteries (BCCAO) to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">Minocycline</z:chebi> or saline was injected daily for 2 weeks after BCCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the corpus callosum and the optic tract, white matter damage observed with Kl√ºver-Barrera staining was significantly attenuated in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi>-treated group compared to saline-treated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In control rats, immunoreactivities of major basic protein (MBP), Ox-42 as a microglial marker, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 were increased in the corpus callosum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">Minocycline</z:chebi> significantly reduced these changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Co-expression of Ox-42 and MMP-2 was confirmed by double immunofluorescence histochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> could be protective against at least some ischemic white matter damage, and its mechanism may be related to suppressing microglial activation </plain></SENT>
