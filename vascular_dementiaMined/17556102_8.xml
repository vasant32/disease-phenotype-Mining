<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> and vascular dysfunction have been recognized as contributing factors in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to study the possible links between these processes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, we have analysed plasma amyloid-beta(1-42) levels (Abeta) and total nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NOx), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (ApoE), <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> concentrations in the serum of 99 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 55 age-matched non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both nitrate and <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> levels were measured by a colorimetric method using Griess Reagent and plasma Abeta levels were analysed by a hypersensitive ELISA method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data showed a significant decrease of serum NOx levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, especially in probable AD and VD patients, as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed a weak correlation between serum NOx levels and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; however, NOx levels were not associated with ApoE and Abeta levels </plain></SENT>
