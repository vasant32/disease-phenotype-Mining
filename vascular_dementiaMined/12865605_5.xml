<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Citicoline is thought to have neuroprotective benefits and has been used for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cerebrovascular disorders, though its effectiveness has not been fully tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This randomized, double-blind clinical trial was conducted to determine whether daily citicoline treatment improves neurocognitive and neuroimaging outcome over 12 months among patients diagnosed with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 30 patients diagnosed with VaD, based upon NINDS-AIREN and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV criteria, were randomized and treated with either 500 mg of citicoline or placebo twice per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were assessed at baseline, and at 6, and 12 months on a battery of neurocognitive tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging measures of total brain volume and subcortical/periventricular hyperintensity (SH) volume on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were collected at baseline and the 12-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The citicoline and placebo treatment groups did not differ in their neuropsychological performance at baseline and the 12-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant declines in neuropsychological performance were noted, as well as significantly increased SH and reduced total brain volumes on MRI for both groups at the 12-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of long-term citicoline treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and neuropathological decline in those patients already meeting criteria for VaD does not appear to be substantiated by the current study </plain></SENT>
