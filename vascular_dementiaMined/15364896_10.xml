<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In view of the finding that the amyloid precursor protein (APP) undergoes caspase-mediated cleavage in the cytoplasmic region, we analyzed amyloid beta-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (Abeta) production in human neuronal and nonneuronal cells expressing <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> APP and the caspase-cleaved form of APP (APPDeltaC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biochemical analyses, including immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry, revealed that APPDeltaC-expressing cells secrete increased levels of amino-terminally truncated Abeta5-40/42 and reduced levels of Abeta1-40/42, compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> APP-expressing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We propose that Abeta5-40/42 is derived from alternative beta-cleavage of APP by alpha-secretase-like protease(s), based on data from treatment of cells with inhibitors of BACE and alpha-secretase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> induction resulted in this alternative cleavage of APP in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> APP-expressing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, immunohistochemical staining of the AD brain with an end-specific antibody to Abeta5-40/42 revealed <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> deposits in vascular lesions with amyloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data collectively suggest that caspase cleavage of APP leads to increased production and deposition of Abeta5-40/42 in the AD brain, and highlight the significance of amino-truncated Abeta in the pathogenesis of AD </plain></SENT>
