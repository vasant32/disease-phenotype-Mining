<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the main features of AD is a degeneration of synapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined if chromogranin A (CrA), the major protein of large dense-core synaptic vesicles, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may be of value as a biochemical marker for the synaptic function in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean concentration of CrA in CSF was about 7.5 times higher than its concentration in serum, and there was no significant correlation between CSF-CrA and the blood-brain barrier function (measured as the CSF/serum albumin ratio), nor between CSF-CrA and serum-CrA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the major portion of CSF-CrA is locally produced within the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in CSF-CrA between the AD (n = 29), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n = 13), and age-matched control (n = 9) groups (99.9 +/- 58.9 ng/ml, 108.0 +/- 69.4 ng/ml, and 115.1 +/- 44.4 ng/ml, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, when the AD group was subdivided into AD type I (n = 12) and AD type II (n = 17), a lower concentration of CSF-CrA was found in AD type I (72.8 +/- 28.9 ng/ml) compared with controls (115.1 +/- 44.4 ng/ml), p &lt; 0.02, and compared with AD type II (119.1 +/- 67.5 ng/ml), p &lt; 0.05, while CSF-CrA did not significantly differ between AD type II and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that CSF-CrA has a potential as a biochemical marker for the synaptic degeneration in AD type I, and gives further support for the relevance of identifying the AD type I (pure AD) subgroup in scientific studies </plain></SENT>
