<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers tau protein in its total (tau(T)) or hyperphosphorylated at <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26986">threonin</z:chebi>-181(tau(P-181)) form and beta amyloid <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1-42 (A beta 42) alone and their combinations to investigate their diagnostic value in the discrimination between VD and AD or MD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The above CSF biomarkers were determined in duplicate and blind to the clinical diagnosis by double sandwich, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) commercial kits (Innogenetics, Gent, Belgium) in 92 AD patients, 23 VD patients, 17 patients with MD and 68 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and MD showed increased levels of tau(T), tau(P) and reduced levels of A beta 42 as compared with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The best discrimination between VD and AD or MD was achieved by the combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three biomarkers, correctly classifying &gt;or=85% of patients, either in the form of a discriminant function or in the form of the tau(T) x tau(P-181)/A beta 42 formula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers may be a useful adjunct for the discrimination between AD/ MD and VD in every day clinical practice </plain></SENT>
