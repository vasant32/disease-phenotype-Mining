<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two-week-old SHR and age-matched normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were left untreated or treated for 4 weeks with an oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day of galantamine, of 100 mg/kg/day of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> alphoscerate or their association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number of neurons and of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactive astrocytes, phosphorylated neurofilament, and microtubule associated protein-2 (MAP-2) and aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) was assessed by quantitative microanatomical and immunohistochemical techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In SHR, the number of neurons of frontal cortex, of the CA1 subfield of hippocampus and of dentate gyrus was decreased compared to WKY rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>Astrogliosis</z:mp>, breakdown of phosphorylated neurofilament, unchanged MAP-2 and altered AQP-4 expression were found as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both galantamine and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> alphoscerate countered nerve cell loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">Choline</z:chebi> alphoscerate but not galantamine decreased <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> and restored expression of AQ-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Galantamine countered to a greater extent than <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> alphoscerate phosphorylated neurofilament breakdown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The two drugs in association displayed a more remarkable effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study confirms a neuroprotective effect of galantamine in SHR and indicates a neuroprotective role of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> alphoscerate in the same model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A wider neuroprotective effect of the cholinergic inhibitor/precursor association was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest to assess the activity of this cholinergic association in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
