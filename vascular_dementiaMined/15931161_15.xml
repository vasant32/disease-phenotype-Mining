<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is related to a variety of vascular risk factors and may finally lead to subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because vessel stiffness is increased, we hypothesized that slow spontaneous oscillations are reduced in cerebral hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we examined spontaneous oscillations in the visual cortex of 13 patients suffering from CMA, and compared them with 14 age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As an imaging method we applied functional near-infrared spectroscopy, because it is particularly sensitive to the microvasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous low-frequency oscillations (LFOs) (0.07 to 0.12 Hz) were specifically impaired in CMA in contrast to spontaneous very-low-frequency oscillations (0.01 to 0.05 Hz), which remained unaltered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vascular reagibility was reduced during visual stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, changes were tightly related to neuropsychological deficits, namely executive dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vascular alterations had to be attributed mainly to the vascular risk factor arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further, results suggest that the impairments might be, at least partly, reversed by medical treatment such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor blockers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results indicate that functional near-infrared spectroscopy may detect changes in the microvasculature due to CMA, namely an impairment of spontaneous LFOs, and of vascular reagibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hence, CMA accelerates microvascular changes due to aging, leading to impairments of autoregulation </plain></SENT>
