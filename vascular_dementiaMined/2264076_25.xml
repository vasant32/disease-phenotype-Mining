<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed clinical and neuroradiologic studies, including <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography, in five patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger</z:e> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical features of these cases consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, together with vascular risk factors such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and often a history of minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and characteristic white matter lesions on brain computed tomograms or magnetic resonance images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction angiography of the cervical and intracranial arteries demonstrated no occlusive lesion in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both cerebral blood flow and the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen were markedly reduced in the white matter (54-77% of control values), and both were decreased in the parietal (73% of control), frontal (74-80%), and temporal (74-83%) cortices, where no abnormalities were detected by brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger</z:e> type may be caused by disconnection between the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures due to ischemic damage in the white matter </plain></SENT>
