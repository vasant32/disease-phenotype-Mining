<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Above protein is a product of amyloid protein precursor proteolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This protein is coded by chromosom 21 together with histocompatibility antigens on surface of thyroid follicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Until now the study suggest coexistence of autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was evaluation of thyroid autoantibodies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Study were performed in 34 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sera of control subjects were obtained from 20 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Incidence of thyroid autoantibodies was assessed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> electrophoresis gel and western-blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thyroid microsomes were obtained from human thyroid tissues by ultracentrifugation and solubilization in 1% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28834">desoxycholic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 21 sera from 34 we detected autoantibodies against thyroid microsomal antigens reacting with 91 kDa antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>16 sera were reacting with 97 kDa, 13 sera with 55 kDa, and 7 sera with 67 kDa proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In sera of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> patients autoantibodies against thyroid microsomal antigens can be frequently detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The most frequent are antibodies against 91 kDa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is important to note that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> patients should be screen for thyroid hormones </plain></SENT>
