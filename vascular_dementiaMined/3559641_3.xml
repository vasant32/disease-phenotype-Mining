<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Five haemorheological variables (haematocrit, plasma viscosity, red cell aggregation, red cell deformability and yield shear stress) and the plasma fibrinogen concentration were determined in blood samples from 21 untreated patients with subcortical arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (SAE, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with those obtained in blood samples from 40 untreated patients with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and from 275 healthy control subjects without vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pathological ("solid body") flow behaviour was detected in the blood of both groups of patients (SAE and lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, highly elevated plasma viscosity was a consistent feature only of SAE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors present the hypothesis that the high plasma viscosity in patients with SAE may account for the progressive degeneration of cerebral white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is postulated that microcirculatory abnormalities due to microrheological changes may be one of the many missing links in the pathophysiology of SAE </plain></SENT>
