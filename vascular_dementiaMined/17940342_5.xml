<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Basic descriptive epidemiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is required for populations in the region to determine the validity of this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main objectives of the study were to assess the prevalence, types and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> among elderly people (&gt;or=55 years old) in an urban area on the Caribbean coast of Venezuela, and to determine the gender and age distribution of affected people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The population-based Maracaibo Aging Study included 3,657 subjects, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom underwent a standardized, in-person interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2,438 of these subjects underwent neuropsychological, neuropsychiatric, cardiovascular and nutritional assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall prevalence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in elderly subjects was 8.04% and was not significantly different for women and men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> was the most frequent type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (50%), followed by vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 41.84% were ranked as mild, 30.10% as moderate and 28.06% as severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in elderly people from the Caribbean coast of Venezuela is much higher than frequencies previously reported for developing countries </plain></SENT>
