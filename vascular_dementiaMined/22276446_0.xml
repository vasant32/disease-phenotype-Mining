<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Geriatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> occurs due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> associated with aging, and as it develops, it also affects the cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To analyze retrospectively over a period of 6 months the clinical parameters and biological differences of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in dialyzed and non-dialyzed elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: There were 63 patients over 65 years included in the study (29 patients admitted to the Geriatric Department of the "C </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Parhon" Hospital, Iaşi, and 34 patients that were in the renal dialysis program into the Transplant Centre Iaşi) that were evaluated in terms of cognitive status and level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> through the following tests: MMSE (the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> severity assessment), the Geriatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Score, the modified Hachinski Ischemic Score (for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The resulting data were interpreted statistically by SPSS 12.0 software and the results were evaluated by t- Student test (p &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average age was 73.2 + / -6.1 for non-dialyzed patients group and 69.8 +/- 4.6 for dialyzed group </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the dialyzed group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> is correlated with an elevated blood <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and the vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is correlated with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive impairment</z:hpo> is more accentuated in the dialyzed group compared to the non dialyzed one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elderly dialyzed people are likely to develop more frequently and more severely vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> than non-dialyzed old people, probably in the context of the factors that are related with dialysis itself </plain></SENT>
