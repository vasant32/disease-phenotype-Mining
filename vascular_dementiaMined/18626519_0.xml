<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Complete neurological evaluation and sequencing of the Notch 3 gene were carried out at King Faisal Specialist Hospital &amp; Research Centre in 2007 on 2 families from Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Sudan affected by CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The index cases had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, behavioral and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852553" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychiatric symptoms</z:e> and accelerated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both families, abnormal magnetic resonance imaging findings were detected in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> Notch 3 exons were screened for mutations in both families and no known or novel mutation could be found; although, in one family the brain biopsy showed the typical granular osmiophilic material deposition and the vascular smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first 2 cases of CADASIL in Arabs, which occur without an obvious Notch 3 mutation </plain></SENT>
