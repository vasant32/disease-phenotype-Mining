<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (PAPS) has been described in patients with a history of fetal loss, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and arterial or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In PAPS, a prothrombotic state is mediated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPLs) leading to disseminated thromboembolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Today, the presence of aPLs in the serum is considered as a distinct risk factor for recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some PAPS patients develop a multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-syndrome with a stepwise decline of higher cortical functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report on a 55-year-old man suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>progressive dementia</z:hpo> and PAPS, in whom cerebral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and blood flow were examined by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>Cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> and moderate signs of leukaraiosis were detected in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), whereas the PET scans showed a considerable diffuse impairment of cortical <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism combined with a reduced cerebral perfusion in the arterial border zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that PAPS-associated vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is accompanied by a cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo>, presumably caused by a small-vessel disease with immune-mediated intravascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This case shows that pathological findings in PAPS are congruent to cerebral changes of metabolism and blood flow in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
