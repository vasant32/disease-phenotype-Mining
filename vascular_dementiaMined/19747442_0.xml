<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of Ruanmailing Oral Liquid, a compound traditional Chinese herbal medicine, on spatial learning and memory ability and expression of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease/redox factor-1 (APE/Ref-1) in hippocampal CA1 region in rats with experimental vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: VaD was induced in rats by permanent occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-five VaD rats were randomly divided into untreated group, nimodipine group, low-dose Ruanmailing group and high-dose Ruanmailing group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another 15 rats underwent a sham operation consisting of similar skin incision and manipulation but without occlusion of carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From the next day after occlusion, the rats were intragastrically administered with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline, nimodipine suspension or Ruanmailing Oral Liquid respectively for 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> experiment was adopted to test learning and memory of rats in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of APE/Ref-1 protein in the hippocampal CA1 region was measured by immunohistochemical method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Escape latency was significantly shortened and number of entries in the target area of rats was significantly increased in the high-dose Ruanmailing group as compared with those in the untreated group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with the untreated group, count of APE/Ref-1 positive cells was significantly increased in the hippocampal CA1 region in the high- and low-dose Ruanmailing groups (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with the low-dose group and the nimodipine group, the count of APE/Ref-1 positive cells was remarkably increased in the hippocampal CA1 region in rats of the high-dose Ruanmailing group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference between the low-dose Ruanmailing group and the nimodipine group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ruanmailing Oral Liquid can improve the learning and memory ability and enhance the lowered expression level of APE/Ref-1 in the hippocampal CA1 region of rats with VaD </plain></SENT>
