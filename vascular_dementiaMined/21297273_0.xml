<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to characterize the APOE epsivlon genotypes and clinical features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients with severe WMH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four hundred and thirty nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 152 subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognition (NC) were recruited from multiple centers in Korea, known as the Clinical Research Center for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> of South Korea (CREDOS), since November 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The WMH were rated using the scale that had been developed by the CREDOS study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> patients with minimal WMH were considered to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) without WMH (AD-WMH: 325), and those with severe WMH were considered to have Subcortical Ischemic Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> (SIVD: 50) or AD with severe WMH (AD+WMH: 64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparisons of APOE ε4 allelic prevalence were performed using chi-square analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The APOE ε4 allele was more prevalent in those with AD than in those with SIVD and NC (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was not more prevalent in those with SIVD than in those with NC (p = 0.169) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>APOE ε4 allele status in AD+WMH did not differ from that in AD-WMH (p = 0.625) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The APOE ε4 allele was more prevalent in those with AD than in those with SIVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>APOE ε4 may not be associated with SIVD although it is one of the vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
