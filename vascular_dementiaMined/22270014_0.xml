<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased brain Mao-B activity is associated with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This alteration can also be seen in platelets, albeit the cause has hitherto remained elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To gain a deeper understanding of the etiology of AD, the platelet proteome was characterised, (2D DIGE pH6-9, including Mao-B) from 150 individuals: 34 AD, 13 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 15 non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> patients, 49 matched controls, 18 oldest old and 21 young individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One significant change was noted after applying false discovery rate with the upregulation of the Mao-B expression (30% adjusted P value&lt;0.001; effect size 1.31) in AD compared to age- and sex-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Mao-B levels were unchanged in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> to matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blot and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> analyses verified these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Mao-B concentration correlated with age in the cognitive healthy individuals (r=0.53; P&lt;0.001) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> patients but not in those suffering from AD (r=-0.03; P=0.874) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mao-B activity correlated with the increased Mao-B protein expression in AD (r=0.81; P=0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggest that Mao-B platelet protein level may serve as a biomarker for age-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, especially AD </plain></SENT>
