<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the MRI and clinical factors associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by quantifying ventricle-to-brain ratio (VBR), anatomic region of infarction, and cortical, subcortical, and white matter areas of infarction in 24 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 29 nondemented <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The factors that most strongly correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were total white matter lesion (WML) area, left WML, VBR, right WML, age, left cortical infarction area, left parietal infarction area, and total infarction area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using discriminant analysis, these factors correctly classified 28 of 29 nondemented patients and 18 of 24 demented patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both cortical and white matter total infarction area measurements were strongly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, suggesting that these factors strongly influenced the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a strong association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and left- but not right-hemisphere infarction area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The only demographic factor that strongly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was age </plain></SENT>
