<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients with AD, 15 patients with VaD, and 49 age-matched controls were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nutritional status was assessed using a semiquantified food-frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dietary habits were very similar in male patients with AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both groups had significantly higher energy intake than their energy demands: +25% for AD and +35% for VaD, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, major sources of energy were different: grains and animal fats for AD versus only grains for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Calculation of nutrients revealed excess intake of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and relative deficiencies of multiple vitamins including <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="23042">carotene</z:chebi>, and the vitamin B group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, dietary habits in female patients with AD differed significantly from those of male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Female patients consumed significantly lower amounts of fish and green vegetables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Calculation of nutrients showed absolute deficiencies of n-3 PUFA, multiple vitamins, and minerals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results show that AD and VaD are similar from the viewpoint of nutrition, except for the higher consumption of animal fats for AD patients, probably reflecting Westernization of dietary habits in recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nutrition may be relevant to the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> through many processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Higher intake of energy and lower intake of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> may exaggerate the process of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> through <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Excessive amounts of n-6 PUFA or deficiency of n-3 PUFA may cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, platelet aggregation, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> of microvasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Nutrition may be useful for preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, although gender-specific differences must be taken into account </plain></SENT>
