<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was established by two-step screening: (1) psychometric testing and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R criteria and (2) neurologist's confirmation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cholesterol, its fractions and apoE genotype were determined from a blood sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Elevated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> was associated with a significantly decreased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, independent of apoE status and other potential confounding variables, suggesting that cholesterol fractions could be involved in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
