<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Even recent genomewide association studies (GWAS) could hardly identify additional genetic factors for VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although a considerable complexity for its genetic architecture was suspected, there were some challenges to identify false negative associations resulted from the GWAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Challenges to identifying genetic factors and their functions after the trials of GWAS revealed that splicing of primary transcript was inhibited (SYK) or delayed (PHLDB2) by a nucleotide substitution of the corresponding gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The studies gave us the lesson that integrated investigations with statistical genomics as well as functional genomics are needed to identify false negatives from the GWAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such endeavors would provide key insights into aspects of underlying nucleotide architectures of VD and incorporate the genetic factors into clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The recent genetic association studies for susceptibility to VD were briefly overviewed in this article </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also showed a challenge to understanding genetic dissection of VD by a genomic regions enrichment analysis with distal cis-regulatory sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The analysis with a variant set of potential false negatives from the GWAS revealed that the variants were significantly enriched near genes involved in critical biological processes to VD </plain></SENT>
