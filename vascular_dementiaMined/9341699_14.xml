<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: White matter hyperintensities in MRI of the brain are often seen in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Radiologically, these hyperintense regions are similar to those in symptomatic patients with subcortical arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (SAE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to discriminate white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on MRI in patients with SAE from similar appearing changes in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three groups of elderly patients were studied: symptomatic patients with WMH of SAE (n = 5); asymptomatic subjects with diffuse, confluent WMH (n = 4); and elderly control subjects (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proton density images revealed WMH in the occipital lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) was used to acquire spectra in these hyperintensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Metabolite concentrations were calculated from peak areas of N-acetylaspartate (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> (Cre), and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> (Cho) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cre and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cho ratios were reduced in the SAE group compared with the two asymptomatic groups (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> was decreased and Cho elevated in SAE compared with control subjects (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average volumes of WMH in the SAE group (65.5 cm3) and in asymptomatic control subjects (59.4 cm3) were similar, and greater than those of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group (4.0 cm3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Proton MRS discriminates WMH in SAE patients from those in asymptomatic elderly, suggesting differing causes of the hyperintensities </plain></SENT>
