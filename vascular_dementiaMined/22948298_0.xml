<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pathology is manifested in small- and middle-sized arteries throughout the body, though primarily in cerebral white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamics is altered in CADASIL and NOTCH3 is suggested to regulate actin filament polymerization and thereby vascular tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed NOTCH3 expression and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of actin cytoskeleton in genetically genuine cultured human CADASIL vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) (including a cell line homozygous for p.Arg133Cys mutation) derived from different organs, and in control VSMCs with short hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (shRNA)-silenced NOTCH3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NOTCH3 protein level was higher in VSMCs derived from adult than newborn arteries in both CADASIL and control VSMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CADASIL VSMCs showed altered actin cytoskeleton including increased branching and node formation, and more numerous and smaller <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> sites than control VSMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Alterations in actin cytoskeleton in shRNA-silenced VSMCs were similar as in CADASIL VSMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Severity of the alterations in actin filaments corresponded to NOTCH3 expression level being most severe in VSMCs derived from adult cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that hypomorphic NOTCH3 activity causes alterations in actin organization in CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, arteries from different organs have specific characteristics, which modify the effects of the NOTCH3 mutation and which is one explanation for the exceptional susceptibility of cerebral white matter arteries </plain></SENT>
