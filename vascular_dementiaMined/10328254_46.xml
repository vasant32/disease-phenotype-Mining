<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CONTEXT: In spite of numerous studies on the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, many questions remain, such as the relation between age, aging, and dementing disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This question is relevant both for understanding the pathogenetic mechanism of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> and for the public health prospective because of the increasing number of 85-year-old or older persons in our population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the very old, including nonagenarians, in relation to age, gender, and different <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: An epidemiological survey where <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants were clinically examined by physicians, assessed by psychologists, and interviewed by nurses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e>, Revised Third Edition (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R) criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A category of "questionable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>" was added when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> criteria were not fulfilled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A double diagnostic procedure was used for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Community-based population, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> inhabitants of 2 areas in central Stockholm, Sweden (N = 1848) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Of the 1848 subjects in the study population, 168 (9.1%) had died and 56 (3%) moved before examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining subjects, 1424 (87.7%) were examined, and the refusal rate was 12.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age- and gender-specific prevalence figures, and gender- and education-adjusted odds ratios were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the end of the diagnostic procedure, 358 clinically definite cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 101 questionable cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) contributed to 76.5%, and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) to 17.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> increases from 13% in the 77- to 84-year-old subjects to 48% among persons 95 years and older (from 18% to 61% when questionable cases were included) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio for subjects 90 to 94 years and 95 years and older in comparison with 77- to 84-year-old subjects was 3.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.7-5.1) and 6.5 (95% CI, 3.9-10.8) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 4.8 (95% CI, 3.3-7.0) and 8.0 (95% CI, 4.6-14.0) for persons with AD, 2.3 (95% CI, 1.3-4.2) and 4.6 (95% CI, 1.9-11.2) for VaD, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> prevalence continues to increase even in the most advanced ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This increase is especially evident among women and is more clear for AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>We believe that our prevalence data reflect the differential distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
