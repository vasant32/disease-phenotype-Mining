<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous neuroimaging studies have indicated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0007371'>corpus callosum atrophy</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and large vessel occlusive disease (LVOD) is caused by interhemispheric disconnection, namely Wallerian degeneration of interhemispheric commissural nerve fibers originating from pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this hypothesis has not been tested from a neuropathological viewpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, 22 brains with AD (presenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, 9; senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, 13), 6 brains with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> (BD), a form of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 3 brains with LVOD were compared with 6 non-neurological control brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>White matter lesions in the deep white matter and corpus callosum were quantified as a fiber density score by image analysis of myelin-stained sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Axonal damage and <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> were assessed by immunohistochemistry for amyloid precursor protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein, respectively.The corpus callosum thickness at the anterior part of the body was decreased in AD and LVOD,but not in BD significantly, as compared with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The corpus callosum thickness correlated roughly with brain weight in AD (R=0.50),and with the severity of deep white matter lesions in BD (R=0.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>Atrophy</z:mpath> of the brain and corpus callosum was more marked in presenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AD than in senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With immunohistochemistry, the corpus callosum showed axonal damage and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> with a decreased fiber density score in BD and LVOD, but not in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0007371'>corpus callosum atrophy</z:hpo> was correlated with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in AD, which is relevant to the mechanism of interhemispheric disconnection,whereas corpus callosum lesions in BD were secondary to deep white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0007371'>Corpus callosum atrophy</z:hpo> in LVOD may indicate interhemispheric disconnection, but focal ischemic injuries may also be involved </plain></SENT>
