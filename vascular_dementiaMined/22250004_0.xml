<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have identified sub-syndromes of behavioral and psychological symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But because of their cross-sectional design, the stability of these sub-syndromes over time remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Behavioral and psychological symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of 84 participants (out of an original sample of 144 patients) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were assessed by using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory every six months for two years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Principal component factor analysis with Varimax rotation was used to detect neuropsychiatric sub-syndromes at each time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 12 symptoms were reduced to four factors at baseline, 12, 18, and 24 months and three factors at six months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the factor structures matched the four sub-syndromes previously identified by studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most stable group of symptoms were a combination of "<z:hpo ids='HP_0000709'>psychosis</z:hpo>" and "<z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo>" symptoms (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000746'>delusions</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000738'>hallucinations</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo>), which became stable at 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of behavioral and psychological symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> sub-syndromes over time has not been studied before, and this research suggests that some stability is evident particularly during the later stages of the disease process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings have implications for patients and their caregiver </plain></SENT>
