<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After initial image preprocessing and registration, image features were obtained that were representative of the mean regional tissue uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These features were extracted from a given image by averaging the intensities over various regions defined by suitable masks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After training, the network classified independent trials of patients whose clinical diagnoses conformed to published criteria for probable AD or probable/possible VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the SPECT data used in the current tests, the OINN agreement was 80 and 86% for probable AD and probable/possible VD, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that artificial neural network methods offer potential in diagnoses from brain images and possibly in other areas of scientific research where complex patterns of data may have scientifically meaningful groupings that are not easily identifiable by the researcher </plain></SENT>
