<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty subjects (14 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 16 controls) underwent ¹²³I-5IA-85380 and rCBF ((99m)Tc-exametazime) SPECT scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Image analysis was performed on voxel basis using statistical parametric mapping (SPM2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to controls, reductions in relative ¹²³I-5IA-85380 uptake were identified in dorsal thalamus and right caudate in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increase in scaled ¹²³I-5IA-85380 uptake in cuneus was also demonstrated in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> relative to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perfusion deficits in anterior cingulate were apparent in the patient group and did not appear to be associated with ¹²³I-5IA-85380 changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reduced ¹²³I-5IA-85380 uptake in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was confined to sub-cortical regions, unlike the cortical reductions previously described in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elevation of normalised ¹²³I-5IA-85380 uptake in cuneus in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> could be a compensatory response to reduced cholinergic activity in dorsal thalamus </plain></SENT>
