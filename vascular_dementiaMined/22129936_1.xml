<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is unclear whether there is a neurochemical basis for extending their potential use in vascular and mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we measured cortical H(3) receptors in patients with subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (SIVD) and mixed SIVD/AD (MIX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radioligand binding assays using [(3)H]GSK189254 were used to measure H(3) receptors in the postmortem frontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus and hippocampus of a cohort of longitudinally assessed SIVD, MIX and age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: H(3) receptor levels were unchanged in SIVD and MIX in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> areas studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, frontal H(3) receptor densities negatively correlated with predeath assessment of cognition using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that H(3) receptors are preserved in SIVD and MIX, thus supporting further assessments of H(3) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> as potential therapeutics in these <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
