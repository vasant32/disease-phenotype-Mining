<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to explore the neuropsychiatric manifestations in patients with different subtypes of VCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A consecutive series of 157 patients with VCI visited the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> clinic in a regional hospital in mid-Taiwan were investigated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were examined with the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI), the Hachinski's Ischemic Scale (HIS), and the Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating (CDR) scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was used to assess neuropsychiatric symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 157 participants with VCI, 41 (26.1%) had VCI, without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (vascular CIND), 95 (60.5%) had vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), 21 (13.4%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) with a vascular component (mixed AD/VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>Sleep disturbance</z:hpo> was the most common symptom in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>Apathy</z:hpo> is significantly lower in VCI without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> compared with VCI with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with VaD had the highest mean composite NPI scores in most domains and vascular CIND patients had the lowest composite scores in most domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms were common in patients with VCI with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It deserves attention that neuropsychiatric symptoms as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> frequently arise from cerebrovascular disease regardless of the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
