<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous MRI studies of WMHs have primarily relied on the subjective and global (i.e., full-brain) ratings of WMH grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study we implement and validate an automated method for quantifying and localizing WMHs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We adapt a fuzzy-connected algorithm to automate the segmentation of WMHs and use a demons-based image registration to automate the anatomic localization of the WMHs using the Johns Hopkins University White Matter Atlas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The method is validated using the brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images acquired from eleven elderly subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> late-life <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (LLD) and eight elderly controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This dataset was chosen because LLD subjects are known to have significant WMH burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The volumes of WMH identified in our automated method are compared with the accepted gold standard (manual ratings) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation of the automated method and the manual ratings is found (P&lt;0.0001), thus demonstrating similar WMH quantifications of both methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As has been shown in other studies (e.g. [Taylor, W.D., MacFall, J.R., Steffens, D.C., Payne, M.E., Provenzale, J.M., Krishnan, K.R., 2003 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The effect size was greater for the automated method, suggesting that it is a more specific measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we describe the anatomic localization of the WMHs in LLD subjects as well as in the control subjects, and detect the regions of interest (ROIs) specific for the WMH burden of LLD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Given the emergence of large NeuroImage databases, techniques, such as that described here, will allow for a better understanding of the relationship between WMHs and neuropsychiatric disorders </plain></SENT>
