<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Involvement of activated microglia in the pathogenesis has been demonstrated in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Juzen-taiho-to (JTT), a traditional herbal medicine, has been reported to have effects on activating immune responses and phagocytosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>So far, little is known about the effects of this Kampo formulation JTT on microglia and in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this report, we studied the effects of JTT on the activation and phagocytic functions of mouse microglia and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>JTT could activate microglia, which was confirmed by the prominent morphological change and increased surface expression of an activation marker CD11b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, JTT was revealed to induce microglial proliferation, and enhance microglial phagocytosis of, without eliciting an excessive production of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, when mice were administrated with JTT in vivo, their BMM showed more effective phagocytosis of fibrillar Abeta(1-42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings implicate the therapeutic potential of JTT in AD and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> accompanied by microglial activation </plain></SENT>
