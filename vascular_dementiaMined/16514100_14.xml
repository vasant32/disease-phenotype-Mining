<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A full appreciation of the presence of cerebral vascular lesions in cognitively impaired patients can be ultimately reached at the neuropathological level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are no detailed guidelines regarding what neuropathologists should look for at autopsy in cases of suspected vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed at surveying the postmortem neuropathological procedures used in different centers in examining <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> of presumable or possible vascular origin in cognitively impaired patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen laboratories participated in the survey by filling in a semistructured questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We reviewed sampling and histology procedures in use and the neuropathological definitions of some of these lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuropathological criteria for the definition of a vascular origin of the dementing process were also surveyed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A large variability across centers was observed in the procedures used for the neuropathological examination and the histology techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo> existed also in the definition of commonly found lesions (eg, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter alterations</z:hpo>, small vessel disease), interpretation of whether or not the lesions were reputed to be of vascular origin, and consequently in the interpretation of the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The appreciation of the presence of neuropathologically verified vascular lesions in cognitively impaired cases may be heavily influenced by the laboratory tools used and also by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the criteria applied in different centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Harmonization of neuropathological procedures is badly needed in the field of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> to better understand the association between various vascular lesions and clinical symptoms such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
