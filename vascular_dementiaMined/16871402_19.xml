<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gold standard to confirm the diagnosis is to identify a mutation in the underlying gene NOTCH3, encoding a transmembrane receptor protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Granular osmiophilic material (GOM) deposition around vascular smooth muscle cells is a specific diagnostic feature of CADASIL and electron microscopic examination of a skin biopsy is another useful method for its diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although accumulation of Notch3 ectodomain on the surface of vascular smooth muscle cells has been reported, the composition of GOM has not been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the relationship between Notch3 protein and GOM, we performed postembedding immunogold electron microscopy using cryofixed and freeze substituted skin taken from two CADASIL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that GOM around vascular smooth muscle cells was specifically labeled with antibodies against the extracellular portion of Notch3 but not with antibodies recognizing the intracellular Notch3 domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In non-CADASIL skin sections, no antibody binding was detected around the small dermal arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From these results, the major component of GOM in CADASIL patients is the ectodomain of the Notch3 gene product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results shed light on the relationship between Notch3 gene mutations and morphological deposition of GOM around the vascular smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
