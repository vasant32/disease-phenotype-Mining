<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">Valsartan</z:chebi> and Ligustrazine on hippocampal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> and the ability of learning and memory of rats with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was induced in rats by blocking bilateral carotid artery repeatedly and intraperitoneal injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The vacuity learning and memory of the rats were measured with <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The plasma AVP and ANGII were determined by radio-immunity methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The activities of SOD, GSH-Px and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> in hippocampal tissues were detected by chemistry colorimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hippocampal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> was observe with light microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">valsartan</z:chebi> and ligustrazine shortened escape latency (P &lt; 0.05), and increased the numbers of rats crossing platform and the time spent in target quadrant (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">Valsartan</z:chebi> decreased plasma AVP, whereas ligustrazine increased plasma AVP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">valsartan</z:chebi> and ligustrazine increased plasma ANGII (P &lt; 0.01), increased the activities of SOD and GSH-PX in hippocampal tissues, and decreased <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> activities in hippocampal tissues (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The damages in structure, number and volume of hippocampal neuron cells were reduced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">Valsartan</z:chebi> and Ligustrazine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The combined use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">Valsartan</z:chebi> and Ligustrazine produced greater effects than either of the drugs alone in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the indicators except for plasma AVP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">Valsartan</z:chebi> or/and Ligustrazine have protective effect on hippocampal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> in rats with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, possibly through inhibiting <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> activation and free radical formation induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
