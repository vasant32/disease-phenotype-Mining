<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is especially true in the identification of mixed forms between AD and VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigates the potential of neuroimaging methods in providing additional information in dealing with this problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain identified a relatively high percentage (39%) of patients with AD (with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> scores of 4 and less) with basal ganglia hyperintensities and also demonstrated basal ganglia lacunae and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in some of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that in these cases a vascular component, consistent with the mixed form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, may contribute to the etiology of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings also underscore the clinical usefulness of MRI in the further differentiation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
