<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Persons who screened positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, using different cutoff scores based on degree of literacy, were further evaluated using the criteria of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among subjects who screened positive in phase I, 134 were diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in phase II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence ratios of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were 2.68% in the population aged 60 years and older, and 3.49% in the population aged 65 years and older </plain></SENT>
