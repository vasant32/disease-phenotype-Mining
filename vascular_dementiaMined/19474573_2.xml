<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> some time during the clinical course of their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the swallowing functions of the 2 most common types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Videofluoroscopic swallowing studies of the 2 patient groups were analyzed according to various oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal variables of swallowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that there are some different patterns of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">swallowing disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The AD patients were significantly more impaired in "oral transit delay over 5 seconds" with liquids (chi2=7.065, df=1, P=0.008), whereas the VaD patients showed more deficits in "bolus formation and mastication" of semisolid food (chi2=4.64, df=1, P=0.039), "hyolaryngeal excursion" (chi2=4.102, df=1, P=0.043), "epiglottic inversion" (chi2=4.612, df=1, P=0.032), and "silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>" (chi2=6.258, df=1, P=0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results could indicate that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">swallowing disorders</z:e> of the AD group may result from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003474'>sensory impairment</z:hpo> in relation to dysfunctions in the temporoparietal areas, whereas the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">swallowing disorders</z:e> of VaD group may primarily be caused by motor impairments due to disruptions in the corticobulbar tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study is noteworthy because it is one of the first attempts to differentiate between the swallowing symptoms of AD and VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A further study that includes patients with more severe degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (eg, patients over clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rating 3) might delineate additional discriminating swallowing patterns between the 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, a follow-up study exploring various kinematic characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> would address physiologic issues of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">swallowing disorders</z:e> as related to one of the most important clinical variables, laryngeal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> in the 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
