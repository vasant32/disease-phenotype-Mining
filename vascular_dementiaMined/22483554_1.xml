<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Polydatin is one of the most common encountered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26775">stilbenes</z:chebi> of nature and a key component of the Chinese herb Polygonum cuspidatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study is to investigate the effects of polydatin on learning and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairments</z:hpo> induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> in rats, as well as the potential mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both common carotid arteries and both vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arteries occlusion</z:mp> (four-vessel occlusion, 4-VO) induced severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> tested by water maze task, along with <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oral administration of polydatin for 30 days markedly attenuated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> compared with the control (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biochemical determination revealed that polydatin decreased the production of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) and significantly increased the activities of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, polydatin effectively alleviated the injuries of cultured neurons induced by oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that polydatin exhibit therapeutic potential for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, which is most likely related, at least in part, to its anti-oxidant activity and the direct protection of neurons </plain></SENT>
