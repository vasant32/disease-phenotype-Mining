<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we used a hybridoma technique to develop a TAPIR-like anti-human amyloid-beta (Abeta) mouse monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The obtained monoclonal antibody, 3.4A10, was an IgG2b isotype and recognized N-terminal portion of Abeta1-42 without binding denatured or native amyloid-beta protein precursor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It had higher affinity to Abeta1-42 than to Abeta1-40 by Biacore affinity analysis and stained preferably the peripheral part of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>senile plaques</z:hpo> and recognized the plaque core less than 4G8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It inhibited the Abeta1-42 fibril formation as well as degraded pre-aggregated Abeta1-42 peptide in a thioflavin T fluorescence spectrophotometry assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The in vivo studies showed that 3.4A10 treatment decreased amyloid burden compared to the control group and significantly reduced Abeta42 levels rather than Abeta40 levels in brain lysates as well as the Abeta*56 oligomer (12mer) in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> fraction of the brain lysates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3.4A10 entered brain and decorated some plaques, which is surrounded by more Iba1-positive microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>3.4A10 therapy did not induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262091" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lymphocytic infiltration</z:e> and obvious increase in microhemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that 3.4A10 is a TAPIR-like anti-human amyloid monoclonal antibody, and has a potential of therapeutic application for AD </plain></SENT>
