<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies suggest that visual enumeration is spared in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aging but impaired in abnormal aging (late stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, AD), raising the task's potential as a marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experiment 1 compared speeded enumeration of 1-9 random dots in early stage AD, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VAD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous deficits were replicated but they were not specific to AD, with the rate of counting larger numerosities similarly slowed relative to controls by both AD and VAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Determination of subitizing span was complicated by the surprisingly slower enumeration of one than of two items, especially in AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experiment 2 showed that AD patients' relative difficulty with one item persisted with further practice and extended to the enumeration of targets among distractors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, it was abolished when pattern recognition was possible (enumerating dots on a die) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although an enumeration test is unlikely to help differentiate early AD from other common <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>, the unexpected pattern of patients' performance challenges current models of enumeration and requires further investigation </plain></SENT>
