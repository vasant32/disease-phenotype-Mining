<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain areas investigated were the internal and external globus pallidus, amygdala, hippocampus and temporal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In AD, the binding of both enkephalins decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> brain areas examined, except in the external globus pallidus for both enkephalins and in the internal globus pallidus for leucine-enkephalin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Scatchard analysis of amygdaloid samples showed a decrease in the number of receptors (Bmax) without any change in their affinity (Kd) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with VD, no significant changes in enkephalin binding were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, in AD, enkephalin binding (mainly reflecting delta opioid receptor subtype) is decreased, especially in limbic areas </plain></SENT>
