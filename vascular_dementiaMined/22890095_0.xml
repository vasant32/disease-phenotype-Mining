<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A cross-sectional study was conducted among participants aged 50 and over in an urban community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were 1:1 matched for age and gender (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> group (n = 497) versus non-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> group (n = 497)) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subjects were screened using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and were examined by a series of neuropsychological tests if screened positive (indicated by an MMSE score below 19, 21, and 24, respectively according to different educational attainment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was defined according to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV criteria </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study showed that the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was significantly higher in diabetics than non-diabetics </plain></SENT>
