<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Endothelial dysfunction</z:e> is thought to be critical events in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have provided insight into maintaining and repairing endothelial function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To study the relation between EPCs and AD, we explored the number of circulating EPCs in patients with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 104 patients were recruited from both the outpatients and inpatients of the geriatric neurology department at General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consecutive patients with newly diagnosed AD (n = 30), patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD, n = 34), and healthy elderly control subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognition (n = 40) were enrolled after matching for age, gender, body mass index, medical history, current medication and Mini Mental State Examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral artery flow velocity was examined with transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endothelial function was evaluated according to the level of EPCs, and peripheral blood EPCs was counted by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant statistical differences of clinical data in AD, VaD and control groups (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients with AD showed decreased CD34-positive (CD34(+)) or CD133-positive (CD133(+)) levels compared to the control subjects, but there were no significant statistical differences in patients with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients with AD had significantly lower CD34(+)CD133(+) EPCs (CD34 and CD133 double positive endothelial progenitor cells) than the control subjects (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the patients with AD, a lower CD34(+)CD133(+) EPCs count was independently associated with a lower Mini-Mental State Examination score (r = 0.514,P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with VaD also showed a significant decrease in CD34(+)CD133(+) EPCs levels, but this was not evidently associated with the Mini-Mental State Examination score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The changes of middle cerebral artery flow velocity were similar between AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral artery flow velocity was decreased in the AD and VaD groups and significantly lower than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference of the blood flow velocity between the AD and VaD patients (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results provided evidence that patients with AD have reduced circulating EPCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Endothelial function is impaired in patients with AD and vascular factors have a role in the pathogenesis of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CD34(+)CD133(+) EPCs may be a novel biomarker of AD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
