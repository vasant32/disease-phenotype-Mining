<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SNc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> neurons both in vitro and in vivo show sensitivity to hypoxic/ischemic conditions and undergo degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain slices, these <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> neurons undergo hyperpolarization during <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, which results in silencing of the neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the role that SNc excitatory synapses play in this process is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we examined the effect of oxygen/<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) on glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the SNc in a rat midbrain slice preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OGD for 5 min caused pre-synaptic ischemic long-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (iLTD) of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transmission, as both alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30768">propionic acid</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> receptor-mediated synaptic currents in SNc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> neurons were depressed to a similar extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> began immediately after exposure to OGD and was not recovered upon washout of OGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological studies revealed that the iLTD was triggered by a rise in post-synaptic intracellular calcium and mediated by activation of pre-synaptic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> A(1) receptors, which reduced <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-dependent synaptic transmission by activating ATP-dependent <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we observed that iLTD did not occlude tetanic long-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (LTD) at the SNc excitatory synapses, suggesting that these two forms of LTD involve different pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results showed that brief exposure to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> results in LTD of synaptic activity at glutamatergic synapses onto SNc neurons and this phenomenon could represent a protective mechanism by reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced excitotoxic injury to <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> neurons </plain></SENT>
