<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">Donepezil</z:chebi> is a procholinergic drug that slows down cognitive and functional impairment in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little research has been carried out to study its effect in other types of neurobehavioural disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The purpose of this study was to describe the response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> therapy in patients with neurobehavioural disorders due to vascular and post-traumatic causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">Donepezil</z:chebi> was administered to four patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> due to vascular causes, to two patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and to two patients with post-traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following an average time of four months, the effects exerted on the cognitive, functional and behavioural areas were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient did not tolerate the drug and another suffered an episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> that gave rise to a moderate neurobehavioural exacerbation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients underwent a moderate improvement, three patients showed a slight improvement and no changes were observed in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In general, memory, attention, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033975,C0459435" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Finding" abbrv="">psychotic</z:e> traits tended to improve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>Aggressiveness</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo> tended to get worse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The functional repercussions of these changes were negligible or inexistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> improved cognition and conduct in patients with neurobehavioural disorders due to vascular or post-traumatic causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results will have to be confirmed and expanded by means of controlled studies, and research must continue into the characteristics of responding patients and the relevance of their responses </plain></SENT>
