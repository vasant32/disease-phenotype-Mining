<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies reported an association between plasma levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> markers and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both fibrinogen and C-reactive protein are considered inflammatory markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fibrinogen also has important hemostatic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association of fibrinogen and C-reactive protein with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was based on the prospective population-based Rotterdam Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fibrinogen was measured in a random sample of 2835 persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High-sensitivity C-reactive protein was measured in the total cohort of 6713 persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We identified 395 incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases during follow-up (mean, 5.7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We estimated the associations of fibrinogen and C-reactive protein with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> using Cox proportional hazard models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Persons with higher levels of fibrinogen had an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The hazard ratio for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> per SD increase of fibrinogen was 1.26 (95% CI, 1.11 to 1.44), adjusted for age and gender, and 1.30 (95% CI, 1.13 to 1.50) after additional adjustment for cardiovascular factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.25 (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.49), and for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> it was 1.76 (95% CI, 1.34 to 2.30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>High levels of C-reactive protein were not associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High fibrinogen levels were associated with an increased risk of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, but levels of C-reactive protein were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> associated with fibrinogen is because of the hemostatic rather than the inflammatory properties of fibrinogen </plain></SENT>
