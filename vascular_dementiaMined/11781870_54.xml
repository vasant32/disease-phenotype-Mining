<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> intake is sufficient, homozygotes for MTHFR 677T appear to be protected against <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphatic leukemia</z:hpo>, and fetuses bearing this genotype have an augmented survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The distribution of MTHFR 677T is worldwide, but its frequency in different populations varies extensively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we addressed the question of whether the MTHFR 677T alteration has an ancestral origin or has occurred repeatedly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the frequency distribution of the previously described polymorphism A1298C in exon 7 and of three intronic dimorphisms, in white Israelis (Jews and Arabs), Japanese, and Ghanaian Africans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 677T allele was, remarkably, associated with one haplotype, G-T-A-C, in white and Japanese homozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the Africans, analysis of maximum likelihood also disclosed an association with the G-T-A-C haplotype, although none of the 174 subjects examined was homozygous for MTHFR 677T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the MTHFR 677T alteration occurred on a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> haplotype that may have had a selective advantage </plain></SENT>
