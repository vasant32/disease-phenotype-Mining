<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Responsive naming to description, however, has been shown to have a more distributed representation in both fMRI and cortical stimulation studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While naming deficits are common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, the relative sensitivity of visual confrontation versus auditory responsive naming has not been directly investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The current study compared visual confrontation naming and auditory responsive naming in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> sample of mixed etiologies to examine patterns of performance across these naming tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 50 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of various etiologies were administered visual confrontation naming and auditory responsive naming tasks using stimuli that were matched in overall word frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients performed significantly worse on auditory responsive naming than visual confrontation naming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, patients with mixed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>/vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> performed more poorly on auditory responsive naming than did patients with probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, although no group differences were seen on the visual confrontation naming task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Auditory responsive naming correlated with a larger number of neuropsychological tests of executive function than did visual confrontation naming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Auditory responsive naming appears to be more sensitive to effects of increased of lesion burden compared to visual confrontation naming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We believe that this reflects more widespread topographical distribution of auditory naming sites within the temporal lobe, but may also reflect the contributions of working memory and cognitive flexibility to performance </plain></SENT>
