<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent findings suggest that plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">24S-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi> may be elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at least at some stage of the disease, suggesting increased brain cholesterol turnover during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">24S-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi> concentrations depend on the severity of AD and on the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (apoE) genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Severity of AD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of the apoE4 allele were independently associated with reduced plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">24S-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi>/cholesterol ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the decrease of plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">24S-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi>/cholesterol in severely affected AD patients is a peripheral marker for loss of cholesterol 24S-hydroxylase in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>Inheritance</z:hpo> of the apoE4 allele may be associated with increased apoE-mediated transport of brain cholesterol to the periphery or with decreased activity of the 24S-hydroxylase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal studies will assess the validity of the ratio plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">24S-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi>/cholesterol as a state marker for AD </plain></SENT>
