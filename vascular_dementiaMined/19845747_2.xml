<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are no established biochemical markers for WMLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to study the relation between degree of WMLs rated on magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of structural biomarkers associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-three non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> elderly individuals with WMLs were subjected to lumbar puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Degree of WMLs was rated using the Fazekas scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Volumetric assessment of WMLs was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CSF samples were analyzed for the 40 and 42 amino acid fragments of amyloid beta, alpha- and beta-cleaved soluble amyloid precursor protein, total tau (T-tau), hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau(181)), neurofilament light protein (NFL), sulfatide and CSF/Serum-albumin ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen subjects had mild, 23 had moderate and 15 had severe degree of WMLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CSF-NFL levels differed between the groups (P &lt; 0.001) and correlated with the volume of WMLs (r = 0.477, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CSF sulfatide concentration displayed similar changes but less strongly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>T-tau, P-tau(181) and the different amyloid markers as well as CSF/S-albumin ratio did not differ significantly between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The association of increased CSF-NFL levels with increasing severity of WMLs in non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> subjects suggests that NFL is a marker for axonal damage in response to small vessel disease in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This manifestation may be distinct from or earlier than the neurodegenerative process seen in AD, as reflected by the lack of association between WMLs and AD biomarkers </plain></SENT>
