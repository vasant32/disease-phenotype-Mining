<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A few studies have investigated a possible relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and occupations with extremely low frequency magnetic field (MF) exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to further evaluate this possible association in a large patient population with expert diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects came from the 8 of the 9 California <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Diagnostic and Treatment Centers not previously used in an earlier study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases had probable or definite AD; controls primarily had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-related problem other than vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) and some were not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> upon expert examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Occupations were classified as having low, medium or high MF exposure, based upon previous research, replicating the exposure methodology used in our previous published studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Occupational information was available for 98.6% of the 1527 cases and 98.5% of the 404 controls with age-at-initial examination known to be at least 65 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among cases, 2.1% and 5.4% had high and medium occupational MF exposure, respectively, while among controls the percentages were 0.8% and 3.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In univariate analyses, the odds ratio (OR) for subjects with medium or high MF exposures combined was 2.1 (p &lt; 0.01), while for high exposure alone the OR was 2.9 (p &lt; 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two models were used in multivariate analyses, with gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and either age-at-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or age-at-initial examination as covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ORs for MF exposure varied little between the two models: 2.2 (p &lt; 0.02) and 1.9 (p &lt; 0.03) for medium or high exposure; 2.7 (p &lt; 0.11) and 3.2 (p &lt; 0.12) for high exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>OR estimates for females were higher than for males, but not significantly higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no material differences between the ORs resulting from univariate and multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Elevated occupational MF exposure was associated with an increased risk of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Based on previous published studies, the results likely pertain to the general population </plain></SENT>
