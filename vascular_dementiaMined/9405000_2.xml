<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency of anti-HTLV-I antibody was found to be significantly higher in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (24/130, 18.5%) than in those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (11/139, 7.9%) (P=0.0169) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, HTLV-I seropositivity was found to be significantly associated with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (11/48, 23%) (P=0.0087), but not with Alzheimer type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, HTLV-I seropositivity was also associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003487'>Babinski sign</z:hpo>, and the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> and periventricular lucency on CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of HTLV-I therefore appears to be one of the risk factors for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in HTLV-I endemic areas </plain></SENT>
