<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To discuss the possible role of platelets in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> by studying the changes of organelles and membrane <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> in platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The organelles (dense bodies, alpha granules, and mitochondria) within platelets were measured with transmission electron microscopy in 25 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> and matched controls, while alpha granule membrane <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> CD62 and lysosomal integral membrane <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> CD63 on platelet membrane were analyzed by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The percentage of CD62-positive platelets was 3.6% +/- 2.1% and 5.7% +/- 2.4% in controls and in patients, respectively (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percentage of CD63 expression platelets was 3.1% +/- 2.2% and 3.2% +/- 2.3% in controls and patients, respectively (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When compared with controls, platelets of patients contained fewer alpha granules (P &lt; 0.01), and had no changes in dense bodies and mitochondria (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD62 levels were different among patients with regarding to the degree of white matter low attenuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is selective degranuation of platelets in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> and the abnormalities of platelet secretion may play a role in the pathophysiology of this illness </plain></SENT>
