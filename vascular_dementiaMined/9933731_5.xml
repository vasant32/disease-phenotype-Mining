<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">Cardiovascular diseases</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVDs</z:e>) are connected with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, but less is known about cognitive functioning among elderly patients with CHD based on population studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the associations between CHD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> among the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>POPULATION AND METHODS: Of the total population of the Lieto study (488 community-dwelling men and 708 women, &gt;/=64 years old), the ambulatory patients with CHD (89 men and 73 women) and sex- and age-matched controls without any sign of CHD (178 men and 146 women) were selected to make up the study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CHD was defined as the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo> or a past <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cognitive assessment was based on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total MMSE scores, the MMSE subtest scores and the overall test-based cognitive functioning did not differ between patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among men, higher MMSE subscores in orientation and language were related to more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>According to logistic regression analyses, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> of men was associated with high age, the use of cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycosides</z:chebi> and physical disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among women, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> was associated with high age and the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In general, CHD has no independent association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> among the non-institutionalized community-living elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among men, however, a complicated CHD may negatively affect cognitive functioning </plain></SENT>
