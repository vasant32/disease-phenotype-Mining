<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>69 patients were prospectively followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The endpoint was clinical diagnosis at follow-up of 24 months based upon existing criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medial temporal lobe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> score on MRI, distinctive patterns on 99 mTc-HMPAO-SPECT, and CSF levels of amyloid-Î² <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, total tau protein, and P-tau181P were used together with neuropsychological testing to assess Se (sensitivity) and Sp (specificity) of separate and combined markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>60 patients reached the endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A definite diagnosis was achieved in 48 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CSF biomarkers had a Sp of 71% and a Se of 100% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sp increased to 88% and 93% when MRI and MRI + SPECT were combined, at the expense of Se </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CSF biomarkers levels also provided clues to frontotemporal (FTD) or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> (VaD) diagnosis when situated in an intermediate range between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathological values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MRI and SPECT contributed mostly to the diagnosis of VaD (Se 88%, Sp 75%) and FTD (Se 73%, Sp 78%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Initial neuropsychological testing had a poor diagnostic accuracy, except for a neuropsychiatric inventory score &gt;40 for the diagnosis of FTD (Se 73%, Sp 84%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Independent of the clinical diagnosis, medial temporal lobe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and total-tau were best correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> at 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, CSF biomarkers efficiently predict evolution toward an AD phenotype in CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Imaging biomarkers mostly contribute to the differential diagnosis between non-AD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Initial neuropsychological testing was poorly contributive in CAD diagnosis </plain></SENT>
