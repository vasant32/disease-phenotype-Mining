<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis that the analytical methods used in research laboratories (RLM) can be used interchangeably with commercial kits (CKM) for SOD and TRAP is tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both methods were compared using linear transformations of the RLM measurements into the CKM scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were obtained from Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lack of fit and the run's test of residuals were not significant, but the same sign method detected significant nonlinearities (P&lt;0.000001 for SOD, P&lt;0.01 for TRAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The intragroup CVs of both methods were comparable for TRAP, while in the RLM determinations of SOD resulted in &lt;50% of those obtained with the CKM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ANCOVA comparison of the regression parameters across the clinical groups resulted significant for SOD (P&lt;0.0001) and not significant for TRAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both methods agree in describing the features of the clinical groups, but the degree of agreement at the individual concentration was poor and they could not be readily intercalibrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> and pathological values should be obtained independently for the CKM to insure their applicability to large populations </plain></SENT>
