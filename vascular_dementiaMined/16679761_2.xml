<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using neuropathological methods, we aimed to compare the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> pathology in fatally injured older pedestrians with similarly aged ambulatory subjects who died from other causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The brains of 52 pedestrians (65-93 years) and 52 controls (65-92 years) were assessed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo> (NFT), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>neuritic plaques</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> and vascular lesions using established neuropathological criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The examination for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) pathology showed that 43% of the pedestrians had NFT scores of III-VI using Braak and Braak staging, compared with 23% of the controls (p &lt; 0.05, Fisher's exact test), indicating incipient, possible or probable AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the prevalence of pathology for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> associated with AD, even in the earliest stages of the disease, may be a factor in fatal traffic accidents for older pedestrians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Special measures for pedestrian safety are necessary in areas with high densities of older citizens and especially for those diagnosed as having a mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> or AD </plain></SENT>
