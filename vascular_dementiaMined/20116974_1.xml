<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that the severity of subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) correlated with an area ratio of white matter hyperintensity (WMH) regions to the brain parenchyma (WMH area ratio) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to develop a computer-aided evaluation method of WMH regions for diagnosis of subcortical VaD based on magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A brain parenchymal region was segmented based on the histogram analysis of a T1-weigthed image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The WMH regions were segmented on the subtraction image between a T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) images using two segmentation methods, i.e., a region-growing technique and a level-set method, which were automatically and adaptively selected on each WMH region based on its image features by using a support vector machine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We applied the proposed method to 33 slices of the three types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images with 245 lesions, which were acquired from 10 patients (age range: 64-90 years, mean: 78) with a diagnosis of VaD on a 1.5-T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average similarity index between regions determined by a manual method and the proposed method was 93.5+/-2.0% for brain parenchymal regions and 78.2+/-11.0% for WMH regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The WMH area ratio obtained by the proposed method correlated with that determined by two neuroradiologists with a correlation coefficient of 0.992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results presented in this study suggest that the proposed method could assist neuroradiologists in the evaluation of WMH regions related to the subcortical VaD </plain></SENT>
