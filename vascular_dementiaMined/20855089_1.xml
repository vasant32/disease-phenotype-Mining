<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To determine the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29191">(OH)</z:chebi> and cognitive function in elderly subjects with memory complaints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the association between cognitive function and OH in 495 consecutive elderly outpatients attending a memory centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure (BP) was measured in a sitting and standing position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined cognitive function using a validated comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests, the cognitive efficiency profile (CEP) assessing the main cognitive areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were classified into 4 categories according to their cognitive status: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognitive function, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this population, 76±8 years of age (women 72%), 18% had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognitive function, 28% had MCI, 47% AD, and 7% VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was observed in 74% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>OH was present in 14% of subjects (n=69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, education level, systolic BP, diastolic BP, weight, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi>, subjects with OH had worse cognitive function than those without OH (CEP score 50±24 vs 56±22, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a significant relationship was observed between OH and cognitive status (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognitive function, MCI, AD, or VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>OH was present in 22% in VaD subjects, 15% in AD subjects, 12% in MCI subjects and 4% in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects (p&lt;0.01 for overall test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results showed an association between OH and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and emphasize the need for longitudinal studies designed to evaluate the nature of the relationship between OH and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
