<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Individuals with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) are at increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and probably other forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some subtypes of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) may possess minor neuropathological changes of AD that may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was posited that MCI, identified by criteria described here, might present as a prodrome for VaD and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serial Mini-Mental State Examination was administered at 3- to 6-month intervals, and neuroimaging was performed annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subtle <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunctions</z:e> were weighted and measured according to MCI criteria defined here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects identified with MCI were then followed up for an additional 3.88+/-3.01 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses of VaD and AD were made according to established criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 3.72+/-2.94 years of follow-up of the original normative subjects, 73 of 291 (25.1%) developed MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 27 subjects who developed VaD, 15 (55.6%) had prodromal MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these, two thirds were subclassified as having small-vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The remaining 12 patients with VaD (44.4%) were diagnosed directly from a cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> status without preceding MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These were predominantly multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> or strategic-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (66.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An additional 35 MCI subjects (47.9%) developed AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Both VaD and AD diagnosed after MCI prodromes manifested similar spectral domains of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo>, which included memory, during their MCI stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In some VaD subtypes, particularly those caused by subcortical microvascular disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> may be preceded by MCI, which has similar domains of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and a similar progressive course that may mimic AD </plain></SENT>
