<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subcortical WM lesions in each lobe and fiber bundle lesions related to the medial thalamic and hippocampal structures in clinicopathologically proven BD brains were evaluated by Kl√ºver-Barrera staining using a grading score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lesions in the frontal subcortical WM of BD brains, brains from non-neurological patients, and brains with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> or large cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were also examined immunohistochemically using molecular markers for axonal flow damage: amyloid precursor protein (APP); and for demyelinating axonopathy: encephalitogenic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (EP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results indicated that the WM lesions in BD were significantly more prominent in the frontal periventricular and subcortical regions as compared with other subcortical WM lesions, in the order of the parietal, occipital and temporal lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fiber bundle lesions in the capsular genu, including the anterior thalamic peduncle, were also significantly more prominent in BD brains as compared with the other bundle lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the frequency of damaged nerve fibers labeled by the EP antiserum and APP immunoreactive fibers was significantly higher in BD brains as compared with the control brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The grading scores for the WM damage correlated significantly with those for the APP and EP immunoreactive fibers in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> brains, including the control brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The axonal damage in the frontal WM lesions of the BD brains was clearly revealed in our study using immunohistochemistry for APP and EP </plain></SENT>
