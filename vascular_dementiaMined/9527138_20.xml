<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A pronounced increase in CSF tau protein (CSF-tau) is found in most patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the specificity has to be further studied, as an increase in CSF-tau has also been found in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>, especially in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As most previous CSF studies have been based on selected inpatients, it was considered of special interest to examine the diagnostic potential of CSF-tau in a community population based sample of consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such patient material has been examined at the Pite√• River Valley Hospital in Northern Sweden since 1986, and includes <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory disturbances</z:e> in the community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aim was also to study if an increase in CSF-tau is found early in the disease process, and whether CSF-tau changes during the progression of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants: Community population based sample of 75 demented patients (43 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 21 with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 11 with mixed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>/vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>), 18 healthy subjects, and 18 neurological controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A follow up investigation (including analysis of a new CSF sample) was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients after about one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Concentrations of total (both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tau and PHF-tau) tau in CSF, clinical measures (duration and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>), and apoE polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CSF-tau was markedly increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 41/43 (95%) patients had values above the cut off level (mean+2 SD) in controls (306 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>High CSF-tau concentrations were also found in most patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, preferentially in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> without progressive leukoaraiosis on CT, whereas patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with progressive leukoaraiosis had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CSF-tau </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of CSF-tau were stable at one year follow up in both patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and there was no correlation between CSF-tau and either duration or severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings confirm the high sensitivity of CSF-tau for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, but high CSF-tau was also found in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, resulting in a lower specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, high CSF-tau is preferentially found in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> without progressive leukoaraiosis, which may constitute a group with concomitant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>High CSF-tau may be present during the whole course of the disease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Possibly, therefore, the same high CSF-tau concentrations may be present before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Follow up studies on such patients will tell whether analysis of CSF-tau is useful as a biochemical marker for early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
