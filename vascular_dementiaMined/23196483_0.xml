<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, an increasing attention has been paid to the epidemiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon is also observed in many developing countries <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> over the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this paper, the author reports the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> among the elderly people aged 65 years and older in Japan using the data from a recent nation-wide survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to the results of this survey which was conducted at seven sites in Japan, the prevalence rate was estimated to be 15.75% (95% CI: 12.4-22.2%) which was much higher than that had been estimated before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> is the most common illness that causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and followed by vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and Lewy body <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As the limitation of this nation-wide survey, no study was conducted in urban area with low percentage of elderly in a population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, additional studies are ongoing into the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in urban areas </plain></SENT>
