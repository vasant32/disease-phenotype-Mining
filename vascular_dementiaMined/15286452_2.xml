<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Considering that preclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> are well documented in AD, the purpose of the present study was to investigate if such deficits are also present in VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cognitive outcome measure was the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sample was taken from a population-based study and consisted of 699 persons who were nondemented at baseline, but out of whom 35 persons were diagnosed with VaD and 170 with AD at a 3-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both the incident VaD and AD cases exhibited baseline deficits on the total score of the MMSE and three of the subscales: orientation to time, orientation to place, and delayed memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups exhibited precipitous decline on most MMSE subscales during the 3-year follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analyses showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subscales that revealed deficits at baseline predicted <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> status at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Delayed memory was the best predictor in both preclinical VaD and preclinical AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, these results demonstrate preclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> in VaD in a measure of global cognitive functioning, which closely resemble those observed in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This observation suggests that circulatory disturbance is associated with cognitive problems several years before the actual VaD diagnosis </plain></SENT>
