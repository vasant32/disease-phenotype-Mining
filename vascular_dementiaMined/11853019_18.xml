<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HCNP precursor protein (HCNP-pp) is known to interact with other molecules including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi> and Raf-1 kinase, and is also known as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi>-binding protein and raf kinase-inhibitory protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess whether HCNP-pp is involved in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD), the expression levels of its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the hippocampus of autopsy brains from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (including AD and ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) were compared with those of non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The in situ hybridization analysis revealed that the expression of HCNP-pp <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in patients with clinically <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> AD was decreased in the hippocampal CA1 field, but not in the CA3 field or the dentate gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AD patients showed a wide range of expression levels in the hippocampal sub-regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis of HCNP-pp <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in brain tissue supported these observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since HCNP is known to stimulate the enzymatic activity of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase in neurons, its low expression in the CAI field of AD patients may explain the downregulation of cholinergic neurons seen in these patients and may thus contribute to the pathogenic processes underlying AD </plain></SENT>
