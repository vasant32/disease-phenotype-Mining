<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of the study is the quantification of the individual contribution of the two different methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 100 patients the diagnosis of entrance, the neurological, the psychological, and the final clinical diagnosis were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For both imaging and psychology the sensitivity, specificity, and the positive predictive value were computed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic of each method was determined from the change of the final in relation to the initial clinical diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neuroradiological investigation took place with MRI, the psychological examination used both usual power and special speed tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The extended clinical diagnostics led for 26 % of the patients to the change of the clinical diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Imaging and psychology supplied different own but supplementing contributions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the case of annihilation imaging contributed with 73.3 %, psychology with 54.1 % to the diagnosis of a neurodegenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, whereas the contributions to the diagnosis of a vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were 83.3 % and 70.8 %, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However psychology diagnosed and quantified the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The contribution of neuroimaging consisted in the differential diagnosis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Organic causes of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> but with consequences for a secondary prophylaxis were additional information also </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Psychology improves the diagnostic accuracy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging improves the differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> and supplies additional clinically relevant findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the qualified diagnostics and differential diagnostics of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> both methods are indispensable </plain></SENT>
