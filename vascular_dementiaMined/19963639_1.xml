<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two phase coupled model is based on the assumption of porous media, being described by Darcy's equation for blood flow and the mass transport equation for oxygen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Simulation results suggest that the flow input is of importance to maintain the oxygen level at the remote region from the arterial-capillary junctions </plain></SENT>
