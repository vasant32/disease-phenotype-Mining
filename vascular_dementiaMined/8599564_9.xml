<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Volunteer cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Volunteers were interviewed and tested in outpatient-clinical research offices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Nondemented, healthy, community-residing subjects, initially between 75 and 85 years of age, who participated in the Bronx Aging Study and had at least 2 years of neuropsychological data and quantitative neuropathologic examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Initial summary neuropsychological score, rate of change score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Summary neuropsychological scores at baseline in subjects who subsequently developed pathologically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were 0.8 z units lower than those of subjects classified in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or pathologic aging subgroups (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> showed more neuropsychological change over time than subjects in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or pathologic aging groups (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> subjects and subjects with pathologic aging did not differ in baseline scores or rate of change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Level of education was strongly associated with initial neuropsychological scores (P &lt; .004), but not with change scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among elderly, initially nondemented subjects who were followed up until <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, subjects with pathologically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> had lower neuropsychological scores at initial evaluation than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects or subjects with pathologic aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> had a more rapid rate of decline than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects or subjects with pathologic aging </plain></SENT>
