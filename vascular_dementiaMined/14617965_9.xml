<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> is predicted to increase in American Indians due to recent increases in longevity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Longevity allows for more people to live into the ages of greatest risk for dementing diseases, like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and the vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dynamics of longevity, consequent increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and the construction of meaning for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are postulated as a natural laboratory for observing the process of meaning evolution for dysfunctions producing perceptible symptoms, particularly ones that involve cognitive and behavioral aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementias</z:hpo> are medically considered pathological, but in popular folk terms often considered a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> outcome of aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this case, however, a non-pathological etiologic attribution is found and designated "supernormal" because the symptoms are interpreted as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but special since the symptoms represent communications with the supernatural world </plain></SENT>
