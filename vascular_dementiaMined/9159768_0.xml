<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hospital records of 1794 early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified 451 patients with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AD and 384 with VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was calculated from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Small geographical areas (postcode sectors) were classified by urban/rural category and deprivation score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five-year survival from presentation of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AD was 32% for men and 43% for women compared to 22% for men and 36% for women with VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that increased age at presentation was associated with shorter survival in early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Socio-economic deprivation was associated with longer survival in VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effects of urban/rural score were accounted for by the major effects of socio-economic deprivation </plain></SENT>
