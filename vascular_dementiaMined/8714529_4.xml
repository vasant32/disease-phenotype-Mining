<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated low contrast acuity and contrast sensitivity using clinical test charts in this patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we tested patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (vd) and mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (md), (Alzheimer' with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Contrast sensitivity was assessed using the Vistech VCTS 6500 test chart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Low contrast acuity was measured using the Regan charts at four contrast levels (96%, 50%, 25% and 11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient population consisted of 19 Ad patients, 9 vd patients and 10 md patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reduction in acuity was found with contrast level in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regression lines were fit to the data and statistical analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We did not find a statistically significant difference between the Ad and vd or md groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We did, however, find a difference between the vd and md groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We did find reduction in contrast sensitivity at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> spatial frequencies when compared to the elderly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, we found a significant difference in acuity when compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> data at the four contrast levels tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Acuity is reduced with contrast in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our contrast sensitivity results are similar to those reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This study points out the importance of using simple clinical test charts and further underscores the idea that there is a primary visual deficit in Ad </plain></SENT>
