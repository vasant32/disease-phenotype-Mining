<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the activity of the serine protease urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) present in the euglobulin fraction of plasma from 17 demented patients with probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), 12 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) and 10 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Euglobulin protein fractions were separated by electrophoresis and gels were incubated at the surface of plasminogen-rich casein-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> underlays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The degradative activity of uPA in this system was measured by densitometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 8/17 (47%) patients with AD we observed an excessive uPA activity (&gt; 200 mIU/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only 2/12 (16%) patients with VD and 1/10 (10%) control subjects revealed a comparable increase in circulating uPA activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> stage in patients with AD allow us to associate high levels of uPA activity with severity of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>uPA levels were significantly elevated (2.8-fold increase) in AD patients with severe cognitive and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairments</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer Disease</z:hpo> Assessment Scale) with respect to controls, VD patients or AD patients with moderate cognitive and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairments</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.001, ANOVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the anormalities in circulating fibrinolytic enzymes could be correlated with the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In light of this findings, the free uPA activity in euglobulin plasma fraction should be considered a marker of serious damage in patients with AD </plain></SENT>
