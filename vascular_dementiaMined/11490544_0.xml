<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epidemiology contributes in this way by estimating the incidence and prevalence of specific categories of morbidity and by identifying the risk or protective factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An integrative analysis of 47 surveys across 17 countries has suggested approximate rates under 1% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> from any cause in persons aged 60 to 69 years, rising to about 39% in persons 90 to 95 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence doubles with every five years of age within that range, with few differences taking into account secular changes, age, gender, place of living.. </plain></SENT>
