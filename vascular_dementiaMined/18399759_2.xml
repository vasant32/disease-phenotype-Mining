<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antioxidative therapy may help prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> caused by lipoperoxidation and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="26519">free-radical</z:chebi> formation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A number of findings suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> exists in persons with high-risk DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Auricular pellet acupressure has reportedly been an effective treatment method for a variety of medical conditions, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, juvenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo>, essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and senile vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, its effects on antioxidative enzymes have not been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We therefore evaluated the impact of auricular pellet acupressure on antioxidative status in persons with high-risk DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Our study involved 69 persons with high-risk DM, who were allocated either to undergo acupressure as active treatment for the experimental group or to a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: The experimental group in the study received auricular pellet acupressure three times daily for 5 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After a 2-day rest period, the procedure was performed on the contralateral ear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Acupressure was performed twice on each ear, with each application followed by its application to the contralateral ear, over a total treatment period of 20 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The control groups did not undergo auricular pellet acupressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND OUTCOME MEASURES: At the end of the 20-day period of treatment of the experimental group, blood was collected from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the study participants for assay of serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and catalase concentrations, as was also done for the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum concentrations of SOD (p &lt; 0.05) and catalase (p &lt; 0.0001) were significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that auricular pellet acupressure can increase the concentration of antioxidative enzymes in persons with high-risk DM </plain></SENT>
