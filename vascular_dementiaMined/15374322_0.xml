<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 25 age-matched controls were investigated with a P300 and reaction-time paradigm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The repetition of the cognitive process discriminating between different sizes of circles led to a significant decrease in P300 latency and in reaction time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was therefore concluded that such a paradigm is able to measure learning effects, and also that vascularly-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients can improve their performance on such tasks </plain></SENT>
