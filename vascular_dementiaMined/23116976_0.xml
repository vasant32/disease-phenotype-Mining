<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 201 patients included (115 AD, 44 VaD and 42 mixed AD/VaD) had been referred to the Psychogeriatric/Psychiatric Department, Lund University Hospital, for psychogeriatric investigation and were followed-up with clinical records and detailed information on psychiatric history prior to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> was considered to exist when the patient had consulted a psychiatrist or physician and had been diagnosed with a "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0349217" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">depressive episode</z:e>" or "<z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>" and when anti-depressants and/or other specific treatments had been prescribed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 9 AD patients with a previous diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> had suffered from only one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0349217" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">depressive episode</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had responded well to treatment, with complete recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the VaD group, 8 out of 9 patients suffered two or more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0349217" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">depressive episodes</z:e> and only two recovered completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Events with a possible significant relationship to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> were seen in 8 of the 9 AD patients but in only 1 of the 9 VaD patients </plain></SENT>
