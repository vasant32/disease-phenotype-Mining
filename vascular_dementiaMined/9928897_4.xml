<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> concentration was significantly higher in VDBT/MSID patients than in controls (p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The nitrate concentration and the combined <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> and nitrate concentration was significantly higher in both AD (p &lt; 0.05) and VDBT/MSID (p &lt; 0.001) patients than in controls, with these concentrations being significantly greater in VDBT/MSID than AD patients (p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The combined <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> and nitrate concentration significantly decreased as the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> progressed in AD (rs=0.70, p &lt; 0.01), but remained elevated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages of VDBT/MSID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that NO production or oxidation in the brain increases in the early stage of AD and then decreases as neuronal cell loss progresses, but increases throughout the course of disease in VDBT/MSID, which may in part contribute to <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> in both conditions </plain></SENT>
