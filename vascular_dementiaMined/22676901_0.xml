<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to validate the MoCA as well as its short version, which was proposed by the NINDS-CSN VCI Harmonization Standards for screening Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results, based on a homogeneous sample of 34 VaD patients, indicate that the MoCA is a psychometrically valid and reliable instrument for cognitive screening in VaD patients, showing excellent discriminant validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both the full and short versions of the MoCA had excellent diagnostic accuracy in discriminating VaD patients, exhibiting an area under curve (AUC) higher than the MMSE [AUC(MoCA full version) = .950; 95% IC = .868-.988; AUC(MoCA short version) = .936; 95% IC = .849-.981; AUC(MMSE) = .860; 95% IC = .754-.932] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With a cutoff below 17 on the MoCA full version and 8 on the short version, the results for sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and classification accuracy were superior compared to the MMSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, both versions of the MoCA are valid, reliable, sensitive and accurate screening instruments for VaD patients </plain></SENT>
