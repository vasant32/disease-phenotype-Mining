<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For morphological macro- and microscopic examinations of the brain, the classic neuropathologic techniques were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although no case selection was carried out, the number of cases was uniformly distributed between the ages of 60-74 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sample was also relatively uniform with regard to the patients' sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morphologically, our patient group included cases with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD-33%), mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MD-14.3%), Alzheimer-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (ATD-20%), isolated SAE (17%), other cases (15.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Myelinic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000980'>pallors</z:hpo> and rarefactions were present in 41.4% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of which: as a single lesion in 41.4%, associated with VD in 34.5%, with MD in 17.2% and with ATD in 6.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microscopic background of myelinic changes was represented by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (perivascular and pericellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (myelinic destruction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo>, perivascular hematic pigment) edematous lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 10.3% of cases with myelinic changes, marked dilation and blood stasis in large periventricular and/or subcortical vessels with subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo>, generally overlapping critical zones of venous circulation could be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The size and severity of the myelinic lesions were not clearly correlated to the intra- and extraparenchymatous vascular changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the myelinic involvement was more in cases with lesions, mainly atherosclerotic, of the vessel walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The possible intervention of the venous factor in the development of subcortical arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (SAE) is discussed among other etiopathogenic factors </plain></SENT>
