<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the nutritional status, the short-term effects of adapted nutritional routines and the long-term mortality in subjects admitted for evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: prospective observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: A total of 231 patients (80 +/- 7 years, 65% women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Body mass index (BMI, kg/m2), serum concentrations of albumin, ferritin, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> as well as Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE, 0-30 p) results and co-morbidity were recorded at hospital admittance and before discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven years later, mortality was registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean BMI was in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range (23.3 +/- 4) as were the biochemical indices, and they did not vary among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and other diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A BMI of &lt;23 was found in 108 (52%) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Weight and MMSE score correlated weakly (r = 0.18, P &lt; 0.01) at inclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During a median hospital stay of 3 weeks, an average <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> of 0.5 +/- 1.8 kg (P &lt; 0.001) and an increase in MMSE score of 0.9 +/- 3 (P &lt; 0.001) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, these changes did not correlate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A BMI of &lt;23 was associated with an increased risk for 7-year mortality (OR 3, 95% CI = 1.3-6.7), which was independent of age, male gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnosis and co-morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional status did not vary in patients with various <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A BMI of &lt;23 was related to reduced 7-year survival, but this result was independent of co-morbidity, male gender and age </plain></SENT>
