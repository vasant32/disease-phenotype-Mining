<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) of "Xiusanzhen" [bilateral "Yingxiang" (LI 20) + "Yintang" (GV 29)] on learning-memory ability and hippocampal somatostatin (SS) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) contents in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty SD rats were randomly divided into control, VD model, VD plus olfactory bulb lesion (OBL, destroyed by electro-coagulation) and EA groups, with 10 cases in each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>VD model was established by 4-vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Morris maze tests were conducted for evaluating the rats' learning and memory ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EA (1-3 mA, 80/100 Hz) was applied to bilateral LI 20 and GV 29 in VD + OBL and EA groups for 10 min, once daily (except Saturdays and Sundays) for 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The contents of SS and AVP in hippocampus tissue were measured by radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In comparison with control group, the average escape latency (AEL) prolonged significantly and the target-platform crossing times (TPCT) decreased remarkably in VD model group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In comparison with VD model group, the AEL was shortened and TPCT increased remarkably in EA group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between VD model and VD + OBL groups in the AEL and the TPCT (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal SS and AVP contents in VD model group were significantly lower than those in control group (P &lt; 0.05), while those in EA group were markedly higher than those in VD model group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between VD model and VD + OBL groups in SS and AVP contents (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EA of "Xiusanzhen" can improve VD rats' learning-memory ability, which may be related to its effects in raising hippocampal SS and AVP contents and to the intact olfactory pathway </plain></SENT>
