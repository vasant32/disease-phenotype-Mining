<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical, neuroradiological, electrophysiological and CSF findings of seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002385'>paraparesis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002273'>tetraparesis</z:hpo> are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, the results of the tests performed, including evoked potentials, CT scanning, oligoclonal bands in the CSF and myelography, were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or inconclusive and did not lead to the correct diagnosis of the aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provided the diagnosis of the causative process: multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> in four cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> of the craniocervical junction or upper thoracic spinal cord in two cases, and upper cervical cord low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0009592'>astrocytoma</z:hpo> in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> could be treated effectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Without MRI, however, the correct diagnosis would have been delayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T2-weighted spin-echo scans provided maximal sensitivity for the detection of MS plaques, although they lacked specificity for a special disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several morphological criteria during MRI were helpful in differentiating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023520" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leucodystrophy</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162309" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ALD">adrenoleucodystrophy</z:e> from MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that at present MRI is the only non-invasive test with which to screen reliably the craniocervical junction and the upper cervical level, both of which are diagnostically difficult regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The case histories also demonstrate that MRI is essential in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients where a full clinical evaluation of the suspected spinal segment is not possible. "Pure spinal MS" is a misleading diagnosis and should not be accepted without confirmation by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MRI has to be performed early enough to permit timely treatment of spinal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain-stem disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
