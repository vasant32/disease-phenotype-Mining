<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous research suggests that the neuropsychological deficits in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) are different from that of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), especially with respect to memory, language and executive functions, but negative findings were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to clarify the cognitive syndrome in AD and VaD in the early stage of these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated 45 patients with early AD, 23 patients with subcortical VaD and 35 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were assessed with neuropsychological battery designed to measure memory, language, praxis and executive functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with AD had significantly worse scores on Story Recall (p&lt;0.02) and on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measures of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (p&lt;0.03 to 0.001) than did patients with VaD, as well as greater number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233651" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">perseverations</z:e> (p&lt;0.02) on category fluency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, VaD patients had more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233651" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">perseverations</z:e> (p&lt;0.02) on the Modified Card Sorting Test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite the similar degree of overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e>, the findings show more impaired retrieval from long-term storage in AD than in VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the data suggest that AD and subcortical VaD affect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000733'>perseverative behavior</z:hpo> in a different fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results may be helpful in differentiating AD from VaD in the early stage of these disorders, when <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>mental impairments</z:hpo> are not pervasive yet </plain></SENT>
