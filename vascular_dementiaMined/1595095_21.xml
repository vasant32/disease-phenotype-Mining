<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to determine the type-specific prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and its risk factors in elderly persons from the Japanese community of Hisayama </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in 887 Hisayama residents (353 men and 534 women) aged 65 years or older (screening rate, 94.6%) using various items of clinical information, neurological examination, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also studied brain <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in 50 of 59 determined to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> by computed tomography or autopsy during the subsequent 54-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Factors relevant to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were compared between 27 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 789 control subjects without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in a retrospective fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> among Hisayama residents aged 65 or older was estimated at 6.7%, with a females to males ratio of 1:2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 50 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in which brain <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was examined, the frequency of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 56%; this rate was 2.2 times higher than that for senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aging, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, electrocardiographic abnormalities, and high hematocrit were significantly (p less than 0.05) and independently associated with the occurrence of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> among the Hisayama residents was relatively identical to that previously reported, but vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was more predominant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were similar to those for lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> may be a key to reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> among the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
