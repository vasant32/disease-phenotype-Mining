<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effects of prolonged <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35677">betahistine</z:chebi> administration were studied in institutionalized geriatric patients with particularly severe and long-standing arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35677">betahistine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> (SERC) or placebo orally in fixed dosage for six months on a double-blind basis and were followed by ward behavioral and psychometric ratings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six others received active medication and were additionally followed by intracranial rheoencephalography (IREG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients successfully completed the two studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No adverse effects ascribable to the drug were encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35677">betahistine</z:chebi> caused definite, strong, and highly significant cerebral and scalp arterial vasodilation and circulatory improvement and that these caused equally definite, strong, and highly significant global improvement in the patients' <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bethahistine, thus, acts in humans as a potent and efficacious cerebral and peripheral microcirculatory and arterial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> which can significantly improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0241832" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular insufficiency</z:e> and any associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, no matter how severe either may be and despite the possible presence of large-vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These improvements sometimes were detected within two weeks or less, developed rapidly to maxima by about 90 days, and were sustained quite well there-after by continued therapy, They may, however, be drug dependent as they regressed in two patients following withdrawal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Various mechanisms whereby a microcirculatory <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> can cause arterial vasodilation are considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The evidence apparently favors that prolonged microcirculatory vasodilatation can cause secondary passive arterial responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The possibility that the IREG contains external carotid contamination is again examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Significant discrepancies between the scalp and IREG effects of bethahistine indicate, however, that the response of any such component was negligible within experimental error and that the component, itself, must have comprised but a small percentage of the IREG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Since the circulatory responses detected by the IREG thus arose essentially completely from the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35677">betahistine</z:chebi> on the cerebral circulation alone, this appears to be the first direct demonstration that cerebral circulatory improvement can cause improvement in mental function in patients with even severe, longstanding, and apparently clinically irreversible arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and that such improvements can be effected pharmacologically </plain></SENT>
