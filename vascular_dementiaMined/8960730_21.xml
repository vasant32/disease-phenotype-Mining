<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with definite or probable AD were the case subjects (86 male, 240 female) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study was limited to patients who were at least age 65 at the time of their first examination at Rancho Los Amigos </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with previous findings regarding the hypothesis that electromagnetic field exposure is etiologically associated with the occurrence of AD </plain></SENT>
