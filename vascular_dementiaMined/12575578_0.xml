<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the mechanism of Huadai Xingshen Decoction (HDXSD) in treating vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rat model of VD was established by repeated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion and treated with HDXSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hydergine was taken for positive control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The content of somatostatin (SS), arginine vasopressin (AVP) and SS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression model rat's cortex and hippocampus were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The SS and AVP contents of cortex and hippocampus in model rats were decreased significantly, and the SSmRNA expression in cortex of frontal lobe reduced, too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HDXSD showed an up-regulation on the above-mentioned parameters, and the effect on SS cortex and SS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was higher than that of hydergine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HDXSD improves <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>intellectual impairment</z:hpo> of VD rats by increasing the synthetic ability of SSmRNA and content of AVP, which in turn improve the neurotrophic effect and promote the restoring function of injured neuron </plain></SENT>
