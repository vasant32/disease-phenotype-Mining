<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Small periventricular zones of increased T2 signal corresponded to a periventricular cap consisting of subependymal glial accumulations, with some loss of the ependymal lining, and a surrounding pale-staining area of finely textured myelin and axons with an altered glial pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The fine-fiber zone is identifiable anatomically as the subcallosal fasciculus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This histologic pattern of subependymal glial accumulations and fine fibers is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and is often associated with fibrotic small blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More extensive subcortical MRI changes corresponded, in 1 case, to multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, and in another to subcortical arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e>) with widespread fiber loss and lacunar changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Wallerian degeneration secondary to infarction occurred in some areas of MRI abnormality </plain></SENT>
