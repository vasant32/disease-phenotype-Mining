<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cognitive test performances were correlated prospectively with changes in cerebral CT measurements of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, ventricular enlargement, local tissue density, and local perfusion to contrast annual rates of changes among patients with ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (IVD) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer type (DAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The cerebral atrophic index (ATI; ratio of cerebrospinal fluid or infarcted brain to intracranial volume), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume ratio, ventricular volume ratio (VVR; ventricular volume/intracranial volume), cortical and subcortical gray and white matter local perfusion (local cerebral blood flow [LCBF]), and local Hounsfield unit (HU) density were measured concurrently and compared longitudinally with Cognitive Capacity Screening Examinations (CCSE) scores among 24 treated IVD (age, 68.2 +/- 9.7 years; follow-up, 42 +/- 27 months) and 24 DAT patients (age, 74.2 +/- 6.2 years; follow-up, 30 +/- 19 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IVD annual changes were as follows: CCSE, +1.2 +/- 5.9; ATI, +2.1%/y; VVR, +3.2%/y; and LCBF in the subcortical basal ganglia, -0.74 mL.100 g-1.min-1.y-1 (-1.8%/y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DAT annual changes were as follows: CCSE, -1.8/y; ATI, +8.1%/y; VVR, +9.6%/y; cortical LCBF, -2.0 mL.100 g-1.min-1.y-1 (-5.2%/y); LCBF in the basal ganglia, -3.0 mL.100 g-1.min-1.y-1 (-6.7%/y); white matter LCBF, -0.75 mL.100 g-1.min-1.y-1 (-4.1%/y); and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cortical tissue densities, -0.83 HU/y (-2.1%/y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In IVD, multiple regression analyses correlated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1392786" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive changes</z:e> directly with (1) recurrent silent infarctions and (2) bidirectional changes of perfusions within frontal white matter, thalamus, and internal capsules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In DAT, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive declines</z:hpo> correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> and cortical hypoperfusion related to frontotemporal and parietal cortical polioaraiosis (decreased gray matter tissue densities) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In IVD, recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were not observed clinically during risk factor control, and antiplatelet therapy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> improved or stabilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In DAT, cognitive performance relentlessly declined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ischemic pathogenesis for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is supported by the following: (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive declines</z:hpo> correlate directly with recurrent "silent" <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, and (2) bidirectional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1392786" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive changes</z:e> correlate directly with frontal white matter, thalamic, and internal capsular perfusional changes </plain></SENT>
