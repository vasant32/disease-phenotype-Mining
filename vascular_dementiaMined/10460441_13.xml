<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We histologically examined changes in cortico-leptomeningeal arteries in five cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> with CAA and compared their morphometrically determined wall-to-lumen ratio [(external diameter-internal diameter) x 0.5/internal diameter] with those of amyloid-negative arteries to estimate stenotic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we compared wall-to-lumen ratios of medullary arteries in brains with CAA and white matter lesions (WML) (CAA(+)/WML(+), n = 5), subcortical arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> without CAA (CAA(-)/WML(+), n = 7), and neither CAA nor white matter lesions (CAA(-)/WML(-), n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Amyloid-positive arteries had thinned walls and dilated lumens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The external diameter and the wall-to-lumen ratio for amyloid-positive arteries was smaller than for amyloid-negative arteries in CAA(+)/WML(+) brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the external diameters among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The wall-to-lumen ratio for medullary arteries in CAA(-)/WML(+) brains was significantly greater than for CAA(+)/WML(+) and CAA(-)/WML(-), but there was no significant difference between CAA(+)/WML(+) and CAA(-)/WML(-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>Amyloid deposition</z:mpath> causes degeneration of the tunica media, resulting in thinning of the wall and dilation of the lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The tunica media of small arteries is important in regulation of cerebral blood flow with degeneration causing impairment of cerebrovascular autoregulation in response to blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This impairment may lead to white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
