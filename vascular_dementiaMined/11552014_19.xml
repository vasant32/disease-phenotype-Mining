<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: It has been suggested that there is a major difference in the ratio of AD to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) between Japan and Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the type-specific prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in community-dwelling elderly from the Japanese community of Nakayama, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with dementing illness underwent a CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A door-to-door three-phase population survey was carried out on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> persons aged 65 years and older residing at home on the prevalence day (January 1, 1997) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ascertainment of cases was made between January 1997 and March 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study included a psychiatric interview; physical, neurologic, and neuropsychologic examinations; comprehensive laboratory tests; and cranial CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A public health nurse also interviewed a person close to each subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was defined according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e>, third edition-revised, criteria, AD according to the National Institute of Neurological and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009460" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Communicative Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> and Related Disorders Association, and VaD according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e>, fourth edition, combined with information from the patient's neurologic history and CT scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 1438 inhabitants, 1162 (81.0%) completed the protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 4.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 60 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 35% had AD, 47% had VaD, and 17% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> resulting from other causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was similar to previous reports, but, contrary to results of virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies conducted in developed countries and those recently conducted in Japan, almost half of the cases in the present study appeared to have VaD with neuroradiologic confirmation </plain></SENT>
