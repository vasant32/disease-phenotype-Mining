<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the number of <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> D(2) receptors in the VaD group as compared with controls </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When the VaD group was subdivided into subjects with or without <z:chebi fb="25" ids="35476">neuroleptic</z:chebi> treatment, there were no differences in the numbers of receptors as compared with controls, and the significant differences in binding affinity remained for both VaD subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present results are discussed with reference to the previous finding of a reduced density of caudate nucleus <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> uptake sites in the same VaD group and to results from studies on <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> D(2) receptors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
