<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of cross-cultural studies of behavioral and psychological symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (BPSD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: BPSD were examined in a consecutive series of referrals to a psychogeriatric service in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and in Korea, using the BEHAVE-AD, the Cornell Scale for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> and the Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The U.K. service served a well-defined geographical catchment area with a multidisciplinary team and emphasis on home assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Korean service was a nationwide service with limited community resources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correlates of individual BPSD in each country and the differences between the two countries were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Koreans were younger, were more likely to be married, less likely to be single, had a greater number of people in their household and were more likely to live in their own homes than the U.K. sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Koreans were more likely to be referred by general psychiatrists or family members, and the U.K. sample was more likely to be referred by general practitioners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Koreans were more likely to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and the U.K. sample to have vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Korean sample had a lower MMSE score than the U.K. sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In both countries, the total BEHAVE-AD score and most subscale scores were negatively correlated with the MMSE score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The total BEHAVE-AD score and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subscale scores were higher in the Korean sample than in the U.K. sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BPSD measured with the BEHAVE-AD were higher in the Korean sample (except aggressivity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These differences may be explained by differing interpretation and administration of the measurement instruments, models of service delivery, availability of primary and secondary care services, health seeking behavior of patients and families, cultural influences, and knowledge, expectations and recognition of BPSD by professionals in primary and secondary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, despite this, there was possible evidence of genuine differences worthy of further cross-cultural population-based epidemiological study of BPSD between these two countries </plain></SENT>
