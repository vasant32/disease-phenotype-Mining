<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This case-control study included 286 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients and 268 controls from two medical centers between 2007 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BMI information was collected from medical records and questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Men and women with low BMIs at the time of the study, in their 20s, and in their 40s had significantly increased risks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) (odds ratio = OR = 2.62-3.97) and increased vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) risk (20s and 40s: OR = 6.23-11.11) compared with those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BMIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High BMI in the 20s and 40s was associated with increased VaD risk (OR = 15.29 and 10.32) among women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For BMI changes from the 20s or 40s, the second and third tertiles were significantly associated with decreased AD risk among women (OR = 0.15-0.35) compared to the first tertile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The third tertile of BMI change from the 20s or 40s was associated with decreased VaD risk among women (OR = 0.06 and 0.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Low BMIs in the 20s and 40s were stronger predictors of AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a U-shaped association between BMI at different ages and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> among participants with VaD </plain></SENT>
