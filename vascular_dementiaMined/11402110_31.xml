<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the usefulness of the 14-3-3 test in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of various causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent reports have suggested that the detection of the 14-3-3 protein in the CSF of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Creutzfeldt--Jakob disease</z:e> is a highly sensitive and specific marker of the disease that might be used as a diagnostic criterion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the validity of this test when applied to a cohort of unselected patients prospectively examined for an ongoing dementing process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred patients underwent an extensive neurologic examination for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, including a CSF 14-3-3 protein immunoblotting assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Final clinical diagnoses were compared with the qualitative results of the test, and statistical measures of test validity were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found a positive test in 14 of 100 patients, only two of whom had definite <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Creutzfeldt--Jakob disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Positive results were found in patients with various degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>, including AD (4), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (2), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with Lewy body (1), and in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (1), carcinomatous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> (1), and anoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two other positive patients, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> could not be confidently classified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value were fairly good, but positive predictive value was poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similar results were found independently of the disease duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between intensity nor pattern of the 14-3-3 protein expression and diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The 14-3-3 test is not valid for discriminating between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Creutzfeldt--Jakob disease</z:e> and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Creutzfeldt--Jakob disease</z:e> in unselected patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Positive results are found in various degenerative and secondary, prion-unrelated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
