<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Leptin, an adipocyte-derived <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25905">peptide hormone</z:chebi> is implicated in the regulation of satiety and energy expenditure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It acts on the hypothalamus to suppress appetite and increase energy expenditure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We undertook this study to determine if inappropriately elevated leptin levels play a role in AD-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum leptin levels of 8 patients in each of the following groups were determined: (1) AD, body mass index (BMI) &gt;25; (2) AD, BMI &lt;20; (3) non-Alzheimer's (vascular) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), BMI &gt;25, and (4) VaD, BMI &lt;20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean serum leptin levels were significantly lower in below-appropriate-weight patients (both AD and VaD) than in appropriate-weight controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Below-appropriate-weight AD patients had a significantly lower mean serum leptin concentration than appropriate-weight VaD controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo> is a feature of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inappropriately elevated leptin levels do not appear to be implicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Indeed, we have shown that the afferent limb of the leptin feedback loop is intact in below-appropriate-weight AD patients and suggest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751230,C0348470,C0869047" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypothalamic dysfunction</z:e> may underlie this feature </plain></SENT>
