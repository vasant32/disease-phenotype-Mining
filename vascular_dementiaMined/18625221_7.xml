<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We proposed to determine the incidence and explore potential mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> in a rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of intracisternal blood, saline and sham injections were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At five weeks, <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> escape latency (P=0.001) and swimming distance (P=0.001) were significantly different between groups, with increased latencies and distances recorded in the blood group in spite of increased swimming speed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of morphologically intact cortical (r=-0.75, P=0.0001) and hippocampal CA1 (r=-0.80, P&lt;0.0001) neurons correlated with escape latency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In spite of only slight early reductions in proximal cerebral arterial diameters, pronounced and prolonged reductions in regional cerebral blood flow were observed in SAH rats, suggesting microvascular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In concordance, cerebral microangiographic perfusion remained incomplete even after 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine immunohistochemistry also revealed microvascular as well as neuronal oxidative DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results provide new insights into the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> in SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They reveal a surprisingly prolonged time course of diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0241832" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular insufficiency</z:e>, most likely due to reversible microvascular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similar to findings in experimental models of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, the data indicate a potentially important role for prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0241832" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular insufficiency</z:e>, probably due to microvascular dysfunction, and selective cortical and subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> in cognitive failure following SAH </plain></SENT>
