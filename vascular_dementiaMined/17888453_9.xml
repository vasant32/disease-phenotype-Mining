<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the broad spectrum of oxidative DNA damage biomarkers and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> in mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>/vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MD) and in control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The amount of the products of oxidative DNA damage repair (8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44605">8-oxoguanine</z:chebi>) excreted into urine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry with HPLC pre-purification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The level of 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine in leukocytes' DNA, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> vitamins and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> concentrations in blood plasma were analyzed by the mean of HPLC technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the first time we demonstrated oxidative DNA damage on the level of whole organism and in CSF of MD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Urinary excretion of oxidative DNA damage repair products were higher in patients with MD than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The level <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44605">8-oxoguanine</z:chebi> in cerebrospinal fluid of MD patients almost doubled the level found in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also the concentrations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> in plasma were reduced in MD patients </plain></SENT>
