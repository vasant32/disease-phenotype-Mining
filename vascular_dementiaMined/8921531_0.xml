<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Presenile and senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer type (DAT), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) and age-matched control subjects were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with CBD manifested limb kinetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002186'>apraxia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1399358" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemiparkinsonism</z:e> and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI revealed marked parietal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, which was predominant in contralateral to the extremities with severe motor dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>123I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> SPECT analysis showed asymmetric reduction of cerebral blood flow, in accordance with the MRI findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The P300 latencies in the two CBD patients were markedly prolonged compared to those of DAT and VD patients, although they were not as severely <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> as DAT and VD patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It should be noted that the P300 was not detected in one patient with CBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The latencies of the N100 were not significantly different among the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These abnormal findings of the P300 may be characteristic in CBD, and, furthermore, may be associated with the parietal lobe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and low blood flow in cortex and thalamus revealed by brain MRI and SPECT </plain></SENT>
