<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relation between plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels and the risk of AD and VaD and the impact of drugs to lower <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels on this relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional and prospective community-based cohort studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Random sample of 4316 Medicare recipients, 65 years and older, residing in northern Manhattan, NY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and AD according to standard criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Elevated levels of non-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>) and decreased levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> were weak risk factors for VaD in either cross-sectional or prospective analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher levels of total cholesterol were associated with a decreased risk of incident AD after adjustment for demographics, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E genotype, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with drugs to lower <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels did not change the disease risk of either disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found a weak relation between non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels and the risk of VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> levels and the use of agents to lower them do not seem to be associated with the risk of AD </plain></SENT>
