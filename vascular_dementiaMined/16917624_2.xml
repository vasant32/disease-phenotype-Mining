<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The CDR scale was cross-sectionally evaluated in 269 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and questionable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable AD and the NINDS-AIREN for probable vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were the gold standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The MMSE, the Blessed scale, the Hachinski ischemic score, and a battery of cognitive tests were also applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The agreement to gold standard was good (kappa=0.73), while to MMSE categorized was moderate (kappa=0.53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation with the Blessed scale (r=0.96; p=0.001) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Education and age were similar among CDR categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The global score agreement of the CDR scale with the gold standard was good, and with the MMSE was moderate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also observed face validity for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No impact of education was observed upon CDR global scores </plain></SENT>
