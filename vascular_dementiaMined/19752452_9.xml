<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: There is accumulating evidence that involvement in leisure activities may be related to risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; however, there is no consensus concerning the underlying mechanism of this association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hypothesizing that leisure activities may contribute to cognitive reserve (CR), we examined the association between leisure activities and risk of incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and its subtypes within a general population sample, categorizing leisure activity as stimulating, passive, physical, and social </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The possibility that these associations may be driven by other proxies of CR was also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Analyses were carried out on 5,698 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-free participants aged 65 and over included in the Three-City cohort study in Dijon and Montpellier (France) in 1999-2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated for incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and its subtypes (mixed/vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>) in relation to category of leisure activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Stimulating leisure activities were found to be significantly associated with a reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n = 161, HR = 0.49, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.31; 0.79) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (n = 105, HR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.21; 0.71) over the 4-year follow-up 1) independently of other proxies of CR, 2) after adjusting for vascular risk factors, depressive symptoms, and physical functioning, and 3) independently of other leisure activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no significant association was found with other leisure activities and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> after controlling for the potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings support the hypothesis that cognitively stimulating leisure activities may delay the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in community-dwelling elders </plain></SENT>
