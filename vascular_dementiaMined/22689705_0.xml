<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Prior research has shown that the total amount of white matter <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> had no significant correlation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the association of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) of total as well as cholinergic pathways with clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity and investigated whether cholinergic ischemic burden had an independent predictive value with respect to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (SVCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight patients underwent detailed neuropsychological tests and brain magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantification of WMH in the total white matter and in cholinergic pathways was achieved using the visual Scheltens scale and Cholinergic Pathway HyperIntensity Scale (CHIPS), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We explored the association between WMH scores and clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rating scale (CDR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To assess the relation between WMH and cognitive scores, multiple linear regression analysis was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CHIPS score was higher in subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> compared to subcortical vascular MCI, while this difference was not found with the total TMHs (TWMH) score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The TWMH score had a positive correlation with CHIPS, however only CHIPS scores positively correlated with sum of box scores of CDR scale (CDR SB; ρ = .474, P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Higher CHIPS scores were associated with lower performance on the semantic word fluency test (β = -.447, P = .036), whereas the TWMH scores had no independent predictive value with respect to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, after controlling for CHIPS score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data confirmed the association of ischemic damage within cholinergic pathways with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity, independent of TWMH in SVCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, this cholinergic deficit is clinically relevant to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e>, especially with frontal dysfunction </plain></SENT>
