<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The regional distribution of WMH may be related to their pathophysiology and clinical effect in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and healthy aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Regional WMH volumes were measured in MRI scans of 20 VaD patients, 25 AD patients and 22 healthy elderly subjects using FLAIR sequences and surface reconstructions from a three-dimensional MRI sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The intraclass correlation coefficient for interrater reliability of WMH volume measurements ranged between 0.99 in the frontal and 0.72 in the occipital lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For each cerebral lobe, the WMH index, i.e. WMH volume divided by lobar volume, was highest in VaD and lowest in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within each group, the WMH index was higher in frontal and parietal lobes than in occipital and temporal lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total WMH index and WMH indices in the frontal lobe correlated significantly with the MMSE score in VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Category fluency correlated with the frontal lobe WMH index in AD, while drawing performance correlated with parietal and temporal lobe WMH indices in VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A similar regional distribution of WMH between the three groups suggests a common (vascular) pathogenic factor leading to WMH in patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings underscore the potential of regional WMH volumetry to determine correlations between subcortical pathology and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
