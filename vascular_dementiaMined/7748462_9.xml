<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Today the clinical diagnosis of AD is made by way of exclusion, and no biochemical markers are available to assist the clinical diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the potential of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as a diagnostic marker for AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NSE was determined with a monoclonal antibody two-site immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) in serum (S) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 45 patients with "probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD)", 19 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VAD) and 33 age-matched healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between S-NSE and CSF-NSE, or between CSF/S albumin ratio and CSF-NSE, findings suggesting that the major portion of CSF-NSE is intrathecally produced and that analysis of CSF-NSE alone (without accompanying analysis of serum) is sufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CSF-NSE was significantly higher in the AD group (4.7 +/- 2.7 ng/mL; p &lt; 0.0001) and in VAD group (4.5 +/- 2.5 ng/mL; p &lt; 0.001) as compared with the control group (2.2 +/- 1.0 ng/mL), while it did not differ significantly between the AD and the VAD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that CSF-NSE have a potential as a non-disease specific marker for the <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> disorders </plain></SENT>
