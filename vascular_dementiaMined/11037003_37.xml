<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy, the dose-dependence, and the durability of the effect of the ginkgo biloba special extract EGb 761 (ginkgo) in older people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or age-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Homes for the elderly in the southern part of the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Older persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (either Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; mild to moderate degree) or age-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> (AAMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>214 Participants were recruited from 39 homes for the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: The participants were allocated randomly to treatment with EGb 761 (2 tablets per day, total dosage either 240 (high dose) or 160 (usual dose) mg/day) or placebo (0 mg/d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total intervention period was 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 12 weeks of treatment, the initial ginkgo users were randomized once again to either continued ginkgo treatment or placebo treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Initial placebo use was prolonged after 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes were assessed after 12 and 24 weeks of intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures included neuropsychological testing (trail-making speed (NAI-ZVT-G), digit memory span (NAI-ZN-G), and verbal learning (NAI-WL)), clinical assessment (presence and severity of geriatric symptoms (SCAG), depressive mood (GDS), self-perceived health and memory status (report marks)), and behavioral assessment (self-reported level of instrumental daily life activities) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An intention-to-treat analysis showed no effect on each of the outcome measures for participants who were assigned to ginkgo (n = 79) compared with placebo (n = 44) for the entire 24-week period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After 12 weeks of treatment, the combined high dose and usual dose ginkgo groups (n = 166) performed slightly better with regard to self-reported activities of daily life but slightly worse with regard to self-perceived health status compared with the placebo group (n = 48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No beneficial effects of a higher dose or a prolonged duration of ginkgo treatment were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We could not detect any subgroup that benefited from ginkgo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Ginkgo use was also not associated with the occurrence of (serious) adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of our trial suggest that ginkgo is not effective as a treatment for older people with mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or age-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Our results contrast sharply with those of previous ginkgo trials </plain></SENT>
