<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Paraffin sections of brain tissue of rats at the age of 3, 18, 24, 30 months were stained by immunohistochemistry, the expression of VEGF and MVD was quantitatively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Innunohistochemical staining showed that the VEGF-positive cells were mainly pyramidal neuron in hippocampus; the intensity of VEGF-positivity in neuron cells was decreased with the aging (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The MVD in hippocampus was also decreased with the aging of rats (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Increasing VEGF contents and improving blood circulation in brain tissue may prevent or treat vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
