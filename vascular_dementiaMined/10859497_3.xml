<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Consensus criteria for the diagnosis of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) are gradually being replaced with data-based criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the inter-rater reliability of a new set of empirically-derived criteria for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (VCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stratified sampling, with optimal allocation, was employed to randomly select 36 patients from the Queen Elizabeth II Health Science Centre's Memory Disability Clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chart reviews were conducted independently by 4 physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each physician classified the patients as having either: no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, VCI or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VCI was further classified both clinically (VCI without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, VaD or AD with a vascular component) and radiographically (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, white matter changes, single strategic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The intraclass correlation coefficient (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e>) for the diagnosis by physicians of VCI or otherwise was based on a repeated-measures analysis of variance with raters as the independent variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant coefficient of reliability (average <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.80-0.93) was obtained (H(o): rho &lt;/= 0.80, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Where differences in diagnosis occurred, the discrepancies most commonly resulted within the subtypes of VCI (9 cases) or between the diagnoses of AD and VCI (9 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Instances of diagnostic incongruity were typically due to the disagreement of a single rater (10 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates a high degree of reliability of criteria for VCI by physicians in a memory clinic, and can also be understood as an aspect of construct validation of those criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the absence of a readily available biological marker for VCI, clinical criteria are necessary and can be reliably employed </plain></SENT>
