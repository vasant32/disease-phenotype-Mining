<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: among 8,213 Chinese people aged 65 years and older, 1,109 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> millitus (T2DM) were ascertained by interview and direct <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> diabetic subjects were initially screened with the "<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV criteria" for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and its subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in diabetic patients with that in ordinary subjects, and analyzed the association of the status of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> including AD and VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to assess OR of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and its subtypes with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: after a comprehensive geriatric and cognitive assessment, 132 diabetic subjects were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence rate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with T2DM was 1.61% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> subjects, 37 subjects had AD, 30 subjects had VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence rates for AD with T2DM and VD with T2DM were 4.51% and 3.65%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the univariate analyses, among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diabetic subjects, compared with cognitive intactly subjects, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> subjects, including AD and VD subjects, were older, more female had higher percentage of current smoking, had a greater duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, took more frequent use of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medications, and stronger effect of APOE ε4 status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In multivariate logistic regression analyses, variables including age, APOE ε4 allele, duration from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, using oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi>, HMG-CoA reductase (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>) were significantly associated with increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with T2DM (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: the present study shows that T2DM is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and its subtypes amongst elderly people in the Chinese population </plain></SENT>
