<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study included 30 patients (11 female, 19 male) aged 50-75: 15 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer type (DAT) and 15 with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), and 15 age-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral refractory period (CRP) was assessed by means of somatosensory evoked potentials with the use of paired stimulation with varying interstimulus interval, applied to the median nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interstimulus interval, with which one somatosensory response was obtained to paired stimuli, was determined as absolute refractory period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CRP was significantly prolonged in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients, when compared to the control group, with no significant difference between groups with DAT and VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CRP correlated negatively with age and positively with Mini Mental State Examination results, assessing the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>mental deterioration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prolonged CRP was noted in patients with vast lesions shown in CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No relationship between CRP and EEG changes was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CRP is a sensitive parameter, which may contribute to electrophysiological assessment of cerebral function </plain></SENT>
