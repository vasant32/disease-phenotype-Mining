<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We designed a modified Mini Mental Test (MMT) battery for clinical assessment of the global and regional higher cortical functions of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested its applicability in healthy subjects with different ethnic, cultural and educational backgrounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The usefulness of our MMT as a tool for the clinical evaluation of patients with various forms of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MMT comprises five subtests, including clinical evaluations of: (A) orientation (6 points); (B) attention, right-left discrimination, speech, and calculation (20); (C) immediate recall, and recent and remote memory retrieval (10); (D) praxis (10); and (E) visuospatial orientation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010524'>agnosia</z:hpo>, hemianopsia, and visual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0150088" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">hemineglect</z:e> (14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The MMT was administered to 100 healthy subjects from two different ethnic backgrounds (Indonesian and Chinese/Taiwanese) and diverse cultural and educational backgrounds, and to 61 patients with various forms of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MMT scores were significantly lower in healthy subjects with a low level of education regardless of their ethnic background (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> had much lower MMT scores than did the comparable age-adjusted <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> had the lowest MMT scores (25.5+/-28.9), followed by those with large cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (48.0+/-7.1), cerebral haemorrhage (49.0+/-8.5), and multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> (55.0+/-0.5) (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With a cut-off point of 33/55 (partial score/total score), the sensitivity and positive predictive value of the MMT were 0.98 and 0.94, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The MMT is a simple and useful tool for clinical assessment of the cognitive functions of healthy subjects and patients with or without vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It can be used for individuals with different ethnic, cultural and educational backgrounds </plain></SENT>
