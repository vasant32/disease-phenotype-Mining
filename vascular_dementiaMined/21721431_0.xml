<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These biomarkers can also be used as predictors of disease progression in persons with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Utilizing biomarkers to differentiate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) against non-Alzheimer <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (non-AD) needs to be explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical use ofCSF biomarker: beta-amyloid (1-42), phosphorylated tau (ptau-181) and total tau protein for distinguishing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) from non-Alzheimer <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (non-AD) in Thai patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: Thirty patients diagnosed of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> during 2005-2007 at Siriraj hospital were offered CSF analysis for beta-amyloid (1-42), phosphorylated tau (ptau-181) and total tau protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was performed by a concensus diagnostic group utilizing a standard criteria for diagnosis of AD and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> CSF testing was performed by Enzyme-Linked Immunoassay (ELISA) technique of the INNOTESTM to analyze these biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients were recruited in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourteen had AD and 16 had non-AD including 5 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, 4 frontotemporal lobar degeneration and others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean age of the AD group was 67.79 (12.30) and that of non-AD group was 65.75 (15.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twelve AD had decreased levels of CSF /3-amyloid (1-42) (less than 487 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only one patient with AD had increased CSF phosphorylated tau (ptau-181) (more than 61 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>None of theAD patient had increased CSF total tau (more than 425 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Eight patients with non-AD had decreased levels of CSF p-amyloid (1-42), one had increased CSF total tau protein, and none had increased CSF phosphorylated tau (ptau-181) protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of decreased level of CSF beta-amyloid (1-42) in AD against non-AD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 85.71% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Those of increased CSF total tau and phosphorylated tau (ptau-181) protein in AD against non-AD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were 7.14% and 0% consecutively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The specificity of decreased level of CSF beta-amyloid (1-42) in AD against non-AD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The specificity of increased CSF total tau and phosphorylated tau (ptau-181) protein in AD against non-AD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were 100% and 93.75% sequentially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The combination of 2 biomarkers would increase specificity but decrease sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CSF biomarker analysis should be encouraged to use as <z:chebi fb="6" ids="33295">diagnostic aid</z:chebi> in memory clinic especially to help diagnosis of atypical presentation of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The usefulness of longitudinal data needs to be explored </plain></SENT>
