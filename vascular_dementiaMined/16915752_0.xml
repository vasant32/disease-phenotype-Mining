<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to compare the outcome of carotid endarterectomy in cervical block vs. general anesthesia in patients with occluded contralateral internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: One hundred patients (76 male, 24 female, mean age 60.81 years) with occluded contralateral ICA were operated from 1997-2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological symptomatology, deficiency and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence were preoperatively analyzed in two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Duplex-scanning, angiograms and CT-scan confirmed the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk factors analysis included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolism disorders</z:e>, smoking and history of CAD, CABG and PAOD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Morbidity and mortality were used to compare the outcome of surgery in two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no difference of age, gender and symptomatology between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>Paresis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002357'>dysphasia</z:hpo> were most frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>70%-90% of ICA stenosis was seen in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> and smoking were dominant risk factors in these two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eversion carotid endarterectomy was the most frequent technique used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In three cases out of nine that were operated under cervical block, the neurological symptoms developed just after clamping, so the intraluminal shunt was placed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Postoperative morbidity was 12% and mortality was 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was no difference of preoperative parameters, surgical technique and outcome in these two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Without other intraoperative monitoring, cervical block anesthesia might be an option in patients with the occlusion of the contralateral ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, prospective studies involving more patients are needed </plain></SENT>
