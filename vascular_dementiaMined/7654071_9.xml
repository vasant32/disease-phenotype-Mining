<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several cases also occur in a familial fashion, and may affect middle-aged or even younger subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant inheritance</z:hpo> was demonstrated in two unrelated French families, the members of which were affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002401'>stroke-like episodes</z:hpo> culminating in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>progressive dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genetic linkage analysis assigned the disease locus to chromosome 19q12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report an additional kindred of Italian origin in which at least 16 subjects presented leukoencephalopathic alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>psychiatric disturbances</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and in 2 members, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002445'>tetraplegia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007024'>pseudobulbar palsy</z:hpo> were the hallmarks of this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Notably, 5 asymptomatic individuals had neuroradiological signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pathological examination of 1 subject revealed a widespread vasculopathy of the perforating arterioles, characterized by deposition of eosinophilic-congophilic material that did not immunostain with antibodies against prion protein, beta-amyloid, cystatin C, transthyretin, or heat-shock protein 70 and was similar to that described in the French families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on the maximum lod score, the most likely location for the disease locus was also mapped to chromosome 19q12, and found to coincide with the CADASIL (cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> with subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo>) locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present results confirm the existence of a nosologically distinct, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> cerebrovascular disease, presenting with recurrent subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> independent of vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
