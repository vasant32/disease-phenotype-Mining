<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were also collected once from 6 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (ACT), C-reactive protein (CRP), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GSH-Px), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD), lactoferrin (LTF), and total <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation (LPO) were then measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood levels of ACT and GSH-Px were increased in AD patients but not in patients with VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels of LTF, CRP, and LPO were comparable between AD patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Erythrocyte SOD activity was increased in AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood levels of ACT negatively correlated with LPO levels and positively correlated with scores of the Global Deterioration Scale of AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ACT might be implicated in controlling oxidative damage of blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and their turnover during the progression of AD </plain></SENT>
