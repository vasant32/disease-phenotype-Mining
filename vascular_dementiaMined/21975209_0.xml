<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We examined the relationship between self-rated health and incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and investigated the impact of cognitive complaints, depressive symptoms, and functional status on this relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants of the 3C Study, a prospective cohort study composed of 8,169 community-dwelling persons aged â‰¥65 years, were asked to rate their health at the baseline examination in 1999-2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were followed for a median of 6.7 years during which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was screened and diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios (HR) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> according to baseline self-rated health (good, fair, or poor) were estimated with a Cox model adjusted for potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the 46,990 person-years of follow-up, 618 participants developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was increased in participants with poor (adjusted HR 1.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22-2.37) or fair (adjusted HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.13-1.59) self-rated health compared to those with good self-rated health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Poor self-rated health was associated with both AD (1.48, 1.00-2.24) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (3.38, 1.25-9.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Self-rated health was a stronger predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in participants without cognitive complaints (risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in subjects without cognitive complaints rating their health as poor: 1.96 [1.24-3.09], p = 0.004) and in those without functional disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Participants rating their health as poor or fair at baseline were at increased risk of incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Self-rated health could help raise awareness of medical doctors about a patient's risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, especially in those without conditions indicative of potential <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
