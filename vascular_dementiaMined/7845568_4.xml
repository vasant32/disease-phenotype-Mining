<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty individuals with probable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer type, 24 individuals with probable vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 20 healthy, elderly adults underwent neuropsychological evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hierarchical multiple regression analyses suggested that perceptual organization skills contributed to a significant amount of the variance in novel, but not famous, face recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This finding was most robust in the clinical groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Causality cannot be attributed from this regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results suggest, however, that visual processing deficits are more strongly related to the memory process at the time of encoding rather than during recognition of remote information </plain></SENT>
