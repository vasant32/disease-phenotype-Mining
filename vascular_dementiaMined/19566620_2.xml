<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased longevity is only of benefit if accompanied by maintenance of independence and quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and other disabling conditions among rural centenarians although this information is important to clinicians caring for them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of disabling conditions, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, among the very elderly in a rural setting to guide clinicians in their care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a population-based cohort study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> residents 97 years and older in the Klamath Basin, a rural region in southern Oregon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of disabling conditions was determined by in-person examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: About 100% of the target sample was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the eligible 67 individuals &gt; or =97 years old, 31 were evaluated in-person </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (probable or possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) was 61.3% (95% CI: 43.8, 76.2), mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> was 29.0% (95% CI: 16.1, 46.6), and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 9.7% (95% CI: 3.4, 25.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>Parkinsonism</z:hpo> and the APOEe4 allele were rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> was almost universally present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: While <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> was nearly universal in this rural population of very elderly persons, almost 40% had not progressed to full <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Determining risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in this population can identify strategies to prevent progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> among younger elderly populations </plain></SENT>
