<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As CSF tau protein is increased after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, tau may also be implicated in the pathophysiology of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, of which subcortical arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (SAE) is a putative subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the nature of tau protein in CSF and the involvement of total CSF tau and phosphorylated CSF tau (phosphotau) in various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using ELISAs for total tau and tau phosphorylated at Thr181 (phosphotau), the CSF concentrations of total tau and phosphotau were determined in patients with probable and possible AD (n=41 and 19, respectively), FTD (n=18), SAE (n=17), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>; n=15) and in age matched controls (n=17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the antibodies stained the lower molecular weight bands, whereas only the antibodies that recognise phosphorylated tau stained the higher molecular bands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both CSF tau and CSF phosphotau were increased in probable AD compared with FTD (p&lt;0.001), SAE (p&lt;0.001), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> (p&lt;0.001), and controls (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CSF phosphotau was increased in possible AD compared with FTD (p&lt;0.001) and SAE (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CSF tau and CSF phosphotau were positively correlated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Molecular weight forms of tau ranging from 25 kDa to 80 kDa were found in the CSF CONCLUSION: Both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated tau isoforms were present in the CSF, and tau protein appeared in both truncated and full length forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the CSF concentrations of tau and phosphotau are increased in about two thirds of patients with probable AD and in half of those with possible AD but are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in FTD, SAE, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Values in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range do not exclude AD </plain></SENT>
