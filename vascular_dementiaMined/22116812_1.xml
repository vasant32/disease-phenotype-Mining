<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Most studies investigating the genetics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> have focused on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, but little is known about the genetics of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to identify new loci associated with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study in the Rotterdam Study, a large prospective population-based cohort study in the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought to replicate genome-wide significant loci in 2 independent replication samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the discovery analysis of 5700 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-free individuals, 67 patients developed incident vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> over a mean follow-up time of 9.3 ± 3.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We showed genome-wide significance for rs12007229, which is located on the X chromosome near the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor gene (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 2.3-5.8, per copy of the minor allele; P=1.3 × 10(-8)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This association was further confirmed in 2 independent populations (probability value of combined replication samples=0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows a novel genetic locus for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> on the X chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further replication of this finding is required </plain></SENT>
