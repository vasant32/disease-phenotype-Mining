<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate its efficacy using more objective criteria, we carried out a multi-center, double-blind study of Choto-san extract (7.5 g/day) and a placebo, each given three times a day for 12 weeks to patients suffering from this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study enrolled and analyzed 139 patients, 50 males and 89 females, with a mean age of 76.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Choto-san was statistically superior to the placebo in global improvement rating, utility rating, global improvement rating of subjective symptoms, global improvement rating of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852553" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychiatric symptoms</z:e> and global improvement rating of disturbance in daily living activities </plain></SENT>
