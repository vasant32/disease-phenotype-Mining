<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate prevalence of AD and VaD in 4 regions of China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional, population-based prevalence survey with a stratified, multistage cluster sampling design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Rural (n = 99) and urbanized (n = 71) communities of Beijing, Xian, Shanghai, and Chengdu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 34 807 community residents (94% of those eligible) 55 years or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants were screened with the Chinese Mini-Mental State Examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Those who screened positive (n = 3950) underwent a standardized diagnostic workup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Screening sensitivity was assessed in a 3.3% random sample (n = 1008 of the 30 857 who passed the screening) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses of AD and VaD were made according to National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer Disease</z:hpo> and Related Disorders Association and National Institute of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences criteria, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Final diagnoses were made after a 6-month confirmation interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 732 AD cases and 295 VaD cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prevalence in persons 65 years or older was 3.5% (95% confidence interval, 3.0%-3.9%) for AD and 1.1% (95% confidence interval, 0.9%-1.1%) for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After post hoc correction for negative screening errors, prevalence increased to 4.8% for AD and remained at 1.1% for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtypes in China is comparable with that in Western countries </plain></SENT>
