<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND &amp; OBJECTIVES: The endogenous opioid system plays an important role in cognitive functions and may also contribute to the progression of some kind of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">Naloxone</z:chebi> has been shown to exert beneficial effects on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> in patients with senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and reverse some of the effects induced by endogeneous opioids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> on cognitive function in rats with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was established by permanent occlusion of the common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were divided into three groups viz., sham-operated controls, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> treated VD rats (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> 0.8 mg/kg, i.p. daily for 7 days), and nontreated VD rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> test was performed to study spatial learning and memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The extracellular recording technique was used to record long-term potentiation (LTP) of the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse in the rat hippocampal slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the hidden platform trials, escape latencies of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> treated VD rats were significantly shorter than that of the nontreated VD rats (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the probe trials, the number of enteries in the target area of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> treated VD rats (8.36 +/- 1.38 times/min) were more than that of the nontreated VD rats (4.64 +/- 1.73 times/min) (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The magnitudes of LTP recorded in the CA1 pyramidal neurons of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> treated VD rats were significantly augmented when compared to the nontreated VD rats (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION &amp; CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">Naloxone</z:chebi> could facilitate spatial learning and memory and enhance LTP in the CA1 region of hippocampus in rats with VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is postulated that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> might exert beneficial effects on cognitive function in VD in rats by modulating the synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal neuronal network </plain></SENT>
