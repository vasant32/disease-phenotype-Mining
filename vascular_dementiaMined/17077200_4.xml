<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) may induce destruction of the extracellular matrix, neuronal dysfunction, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increased expression of these molecules has been found in a number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression and activity of MMPs may be genetically influenced by common polymorphisms in the promoter regions of the corresponding genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether functional polymorphisms of MMP genes are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study including a total of 599 individuals: 193 with VAD, 183 with AD, and 223 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms of the MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-9 genes were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MMP-1 2G2G, MMP-1 1G2G, MMP-3 5A5A, and MMP-9 TT genotypes were significantly and independently associated with VAD (odds ratio [OR] 2.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-4.4, OR = 1.7, 95% CI, 1.0-2.7, OR = 2.9, 95% CI, 1.5-5.9, and OR = 6.8, 95% CI, 1.3-35.1, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MMP-1 2G2G and MMP-3 5A5A genotypes were associated with increased risk of AD only in persons who carry the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (APOE) epsilon4 allele (OR = 6.0, 95% CI, 2.3-15.5, and OR = 14.3, 95% CI, 3.2-63.0, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the odds of VAD and AD was further increased in persons concomitantly carrying more than one MMP gene variation, compared to individuals that only had one high-risk genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that MMP gene polymorphisms are associated with VAD and AD, although these results need to be treated with caution until replicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MMP genotypes may influence the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and merit further investigation as potential genetic markers of disease </plain></SENT>
