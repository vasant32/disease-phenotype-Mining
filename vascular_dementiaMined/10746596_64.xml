<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether use of vitamin E and C supplements protects against subsequent development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and poor cognitive functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Honolulu-Asia Aging Study is a longitudinal study of Japanese-American men living in Hawaii </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data for this study were obtained from a subsample of the cohort interviewed in 1982, and from the entire cohort from a mailed questionnaire in 1988 and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> prevalence survey in 1991 to 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjects included 3,385 men, age 71 to 93 years, whose use of vitamin E and C supplements had been ascertained previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cognitive performance was assessed with the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument, and subjects were stratified into four groups: low, low <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, mid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and high <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> analyses, subjects were divided into five mutually exclusive groups: AD (n = 47), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n = 35), mixed/other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n = 50), low cognitive test scorers without diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n = 254), and cognitively intact (n = 2,999; reference) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In a multivariate model controlling for other factors, a significant protective effect was found for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in men who had reported taking both vitamin E and C supplements in 1988 (odds ratio [OR], 0.12; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They were also protected against mixed/other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No protective effect was found for Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 0.91 to 3.62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, use of either vitamin E or C supplements alone in 1988 was associated significantly with better cognitive test performance at the 1991 to 1993 examination (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.50), and use of both vitamin E and C together had borderline significance (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.995 to 1.39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that vitamin E and C supplements may protect against vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and may improve cognitive function in late life </plain></SENT>
