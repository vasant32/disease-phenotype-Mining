<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 23 general practices we recruited 195 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, 108 were suffering from possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 59 from possible vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 28 from secondary or unclassified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 229 control subjects was recruited: 122 population controls and 107 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-free ambulatory patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were gathered in a structured personal interview and analyzed using logistic regression, to control for age, region, sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in parents, education and smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were significantly decreased odds ratios for the number of confidants, sports activities, and cultural activities at age 30, at age 50 and at 10 years before data collection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> psychosocial network factors were included simultaneously in the logistic regression model, these factors remained statistically significant, indicating independent effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Restriction of the analysis to cases with possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> or to cases with possible vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> led to similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for the psychosocial network neutralized the otherwise protective effect of education for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of any type and for possible vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In keeping with the results from recently published studies, these results support a protective role for the psychosocial network-especially for the number of confidants and for sports and cultural activities-in the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
