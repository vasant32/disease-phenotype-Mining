<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present report, alterations of cortex <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and their links to clinical worsening were investigated in 190 CADASIL patients followed during 24.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Linear models were used to test relationships between: (1) clinical worsening and changes of depth of cortical sulci and of cortical thickness; (2) alterations of cortical <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and changes of volume of white matter hyperintensities (WMH(v)) and of lacunar lesions (LL(v)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reduction of sulcal depth was independently associated with increased time to complete trail making test A and B (p &lt; 0.0001 and p = 0.004) and that of cortical thickness to increased disability (modified Rankin's scale, p = 0.008), while brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was only related to global cognitive worsening (Mattis <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rating scale, p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The impact of volume of lacunar lesions on cortical alterations was larger than that of volume of white matter hyperintensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cortical alterations, mainly related to lacunar lesions, evolve parallel to clinical worsening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results further support the eventual role of cortical alterations in subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
