<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In total, 900 patients suffering from mild-to-moderate "probable" VaD (according to NINDS-AIREN criteria) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these prospective, 2-arm parallel, multicenter trials conducted in the United Kingdom (MMM500) and in France (MMM300), patients suffering from "probable" vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (according to NINDS-AIREN criteria) were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Active treatment in both trials was memantine at the standard daily dose of 10 mg b.i.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cognitive subscale of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog) was a primary endpoint in both trials, and in both trials a statistically significant difference was seen between treatment groups after 28 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a pooled analysis of the data, various subgroups were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a first analysis, patients were stratified by their severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (measured by the MMSE total scores at baseline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this analysis, memantine was superior to placebo in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subgroups, but the magnitude of effect was clearly more pronounced in the more severely <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A second analysis stratified the patients by the neuroradiological findings at baseline ("small vessel" versus "large vessel" type of VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cognitive benefit by memantine treatment was larger for the small vessel group and, interestingly, also the decline in the placebo group was faster in the small vessel patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In these trials, memantine at a dose of 10 mg b.i.d. was safe and very well tolerated with a frequency of dropouts due to adverse events that was close to placebo </plain></SENT>
