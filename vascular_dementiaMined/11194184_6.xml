<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to develop the Korean version of the NPI (K-NPI) and to test its reliability and usefulness in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subjects were 49 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and 92 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (43), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (32), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751072" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="FTLD">frontotemporal lobar degeneration</z:e> (11), and other causes (6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their caregivers familiar with the subjects' everyday behavior were interviewed with the K-NPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a subgroup (29/141) of the caregivers, the K-NPI was repeated for test-retest reliability, average of 23.1 days after the initial test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prevalence rates of 12 behavioral domains in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients were comparable to those of the original NPI; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo> was the most common and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000738'>hallucination</z:hpo> was the least common behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total K-NPI scores correlated positively with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity assessed with the Korean Mini-Mental State Examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Test-retest reliabilities of frequencies and severities of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subscales were significantly high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo>, night-time behavior, and eating change were identified at very low rates in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and were significantly less than those in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The K-NPI, whose reliability and competency are comparable to those of the original version, may be a reliable and useful tool for measuring neuropsychiatric disturbances in Korean <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
