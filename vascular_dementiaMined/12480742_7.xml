<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The existence of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) was first identified by Marie, who described the etat lacunaire, and by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger</z:e>, who identified white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of cortical lesions, while clear to clinicians, was highlighted only later by the pathological studies of Tomlinson and the clinical demonstrations of Hachinski et al., who have defined multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lately, the emphasis shifted to pathogenic mechanisms with the identification of a multitude of processes, including lipohyalinosis, cardiac dysfunction, and genetic causes, to name only a few </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated the high frequency of VaD, as well as the fact that vascular factors can contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these considerations converge to the realization that VaD is an extremely important clinical entity and that its prevention and treatment are within reach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In fact, there are more data on how to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (and presumably VaD) than AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, many factors that were identified as contributing to cerebrovascular disease in general and VaD in particular are frequently suspected as predisposing to AD as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This surprising finding highlights the importance of mixed vascular-degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> as a disorder that has to be properly defined and has important implications on prevention and treatment </plain></SENT>
