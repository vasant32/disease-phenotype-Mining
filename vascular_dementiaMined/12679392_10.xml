<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Small-vessel disease with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, which is the most frequent type of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), often shows a cerebral blood flow (CBF) distribution with no obvious focal abnormalities and is therefore difficult to evaluate objectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we combined CBF SPECT with 3-dimensional fractal analysis (3D-FA) to quantitatively assess the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of CBF distribution and with 3-dimensional stereotactic surface projections (3D-SSP) to evaluate the distribution of CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We then evaluated the clinical validity of these techniques for the imaging diagnosis of VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects consisted of 17 patients who were diagnosed as having VaD due to small-vessel disease (VaD group) on the basis of a full clinical examination, including history, neuropsychologic tests, neurologic examination, and neuroimaging methods, and 20 healthy volunteers (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CBF SPECT was performed with (99m)Tc-hexamethylpropyleneamine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi>, and the reconstructed images were subjected to image processing by 3D-FA and 3D-SSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on the results, the fractal dimension (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e>) was compared between the VaD and control groups, and the distribution pattern of CBF was examined in the VaD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> values in the VaD group and the control group were 1.093 +/- 0.153 and 0.853 +/- 0.062 (mean +/- SD), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> value in the VaD group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>3D-SSP analysis in the VaD group showed that there were 2 abnormal patterns: One was globally reduced blood flow in the whole cerebral cortex, and the other was a reduction mainly confined to the frontal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CBF SPECT images showed higher mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> values in the VaD group than in the control group, suggesting a difference in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Image processing with 3D-SSP successfully revealed that reduced cortical blood flow could be divided into 2 patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because image analysis techniques, such as 3D-FA and 3D-SSP, allowed the simple and objective evaluation of CBF in patients with VaD, these methods seem to be useful for detailed examination of the blood flow pattern detected by CBF SPECT in patients with VaD </plain></SENT>
