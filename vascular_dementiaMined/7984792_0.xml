<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Lesions in the periventricular white matter are a quite common neuroradiological finding in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are called leukoaraiosis and can be associated to several syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the relation between leukoaraiosis and the different vascular risk factors that can be involved in its development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Fifty consecutive patients with leukoaraiosis in CT scan were included as well as fifty age and sex-matched controls; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them belonged to the same population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Previously vascular risk factors were defined according to strict criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The commonest vascular risk factor was arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, in second place previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> and in third place <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a very significant difference for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in the univariant analysis, which was subsequently confirmed in the multivariant analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The vascular risk factor most strongly associated to leukoaraiosis was arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> followed by cerebrovascular disease and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remaining of the analysed factors had a insignificant prediction power </plain></SENT>
