<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, the relationship between APOE-epsilon4 genotype and volumetric indices was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: MRI-based volume measurements of the whole-brain, ventricles, frontal lobe, temporal lobe, hippocampus, and amygdala were acquired in elderly subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> (n = 27; mean age = 75.9 years), AD (n = 25; 77.2 years), VaD (n = 24; 76.9 years), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects (n = 26; 76.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> had significantly larger temporal lobe, hippocampal, and amygdala volumes than those with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant volumetric difference between subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> and VaD was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with control subjects, ventricular volumes were increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, though those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> showed a relative preservation of whole-brain volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in frontal lobe volumes between the four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>APOE-epsilon4 status was not associated with volumetric indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings support the hypothesis that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> is associated with a relative preservation of temporal lobe structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the differentiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> and AD, this may have important implications for diagnosis </plain></SENT>
