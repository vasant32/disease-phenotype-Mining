<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Following the success of the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, groups interested in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> have now adopted similar criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To assess whether the validity of these criteria are influenced by the prevalence of mixed pathologies or by the prevalence rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A community based post-mortem study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mixed pathologies were common (33.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The high specificities obtained for the CDLB and NINDS-AIREN criteria (1.00 and 0.95, respectively) were associated with low sensitivities (0.22 and 0.43, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Low prevalence and the presence of mixed pathologies had a deleterious effect on positive predictive values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Current clinical diagnostic criteria are good at detecting pathology per se but not at detecting pure pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A large proportion of subjects from the general population fulfilling probable CDLB, probable NINCDS-ADRDA or probable NINDS-AIREN will have mixed pathologies </plain></SENT>
