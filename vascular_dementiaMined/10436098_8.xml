<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It has been suggested that daily intake of aspirin is associated with a reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>, both in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> subjects, but the mechanism is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have therefore studied the relationship between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> (TX) A(2) biosynthesis, as reflected by the urinary excretion of 11-dehydro-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26996">TXB</z:chebi>(2), and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in patients after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients from the Rotterdam <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Databank were screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> between 3 and 9 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients had a full neurological examination, neuropsychological screening, and, if indicated, extensive neuropsychological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Criteria used for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e>, Third Edition (Revised) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Urine samples were taken at the time of screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Urinary 11-dehydro-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26996">TXB</z:chebi>(2) was measured by means of a previously validated radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 71 patients, and urine samples were available for 62 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median value (range) of 11-dehydro-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26996">TXB</z:chebi>(2) was 399 (89 to 2105) pmol/mmol <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients versus 273 (80 to 1957) for 69 controls with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> but without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (P=0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No difference was found between 44 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 404 (89 to 2105) pmol/mmol <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, and 18 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> plus cerebrovascular disease, 399 (96 to 1467) pmol/mmol <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> (P=0.68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a stepwise logistic regression analysis, in which possible confounders such as use of antiplatelet medication, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, and type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were taken into account, increased urinary excretion of 11-dehydro-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26996">TXB</z:chebi>(2) remained independently related to the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.22 per 100 pmol/mmol <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The difference in metabolite excretion rates between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> and nondemented patients was most prominent within the subgroup of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients who received aspirin (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> biosynthesis in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is associated with the presence of but not the type of poststroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is particularly apparent in patients on aspirin, thereby suggesting the involvement of extraplatelet sources of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36088">TXA</z:chebi>(2) production in this setting </plain></SENT>
