<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Out of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the elderly residents aged 65 years and over living in Yoita town in 2000 (n = 1673), 1544 participated in the interview survey held at community halls or at home (92.3% response) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They underwent a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for assessment of cognitive function and answered questionnaires covering socio-demographic, psychological, physical and medical, and social activity items (2000/11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We defined <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> as an MMSE &lt; or = 1 SD below the age-specific mean (n = 371) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Out of a total eligible population of 332, 158 pairs of subjects and their proxies participated in a follow-up survey (2001/11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The subjects themselves underwent MMSE again, and were asked for complaints of memory-related problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proxies answered about functional capacity and memory-related problems of subjects, for which we assessed the level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with the Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating (CDR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We established criteria for encouragement to undergo detailed examination by a medical specialist as follows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>1) MMSE scores &lt; or = 1 SD below age-specific means at both baseline and follow-up surveys, or 2) CDR &gt; or = 0.5, and 3) not due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Non-participants had significant higher MMSE scores but were younger in the follow-up survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Out of 96 subjects eligible for the detailed examination, 47 participants showed a tendency for older age with lower MMSE scores or younger age with higher MMSE scores than the average in the follow-up survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The detailed examinations confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer's type in 22 and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in 13 on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV or magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During our screening, 8 community care saloons were opened and the number of facilities for older people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> is increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To establish a community health care system to screen and cope with community-dwelling older people with MCD in earlier stages, increased awareness of residents with slight MCD is especially important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our attempt also suggested the importance of educational lectures, methods for testing cognitive function, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> care activity </plain></SENT>
