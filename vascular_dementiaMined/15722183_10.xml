<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, results on the association of the ACE-I allele with AD have been inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A recent meta-analysis reported an association of the I-allele with the risk of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A few small studies also investigated the effect of ACE polymorphism on the risk of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the effect of ACE I/D polymorphism in 351 AD and 155 VD patients and 348 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found the I/I genotype to be associated with an increased risk of AD, but not with the risk of VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cell-specific effects of ACE polymorphism are suggested, additional studies on neuronal cells might help to understand the role of this polymorphism in AD </plain></SENT>
