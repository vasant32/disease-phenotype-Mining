<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We surveyed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> case-control studies on ApoE gene and VD patients with comprehensive search and review of the references </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis was performed to demonstrate the association of ApoE gene with VD by random effects models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association was assessed by odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 18 studies including 935 patients and 1,686 controls were eligible and abstracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ApoE ε3/4 and ε4/4 genotype, as well as ε4 allele (OR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.52-2.49; OR = 3.47, 95% CI: 1.85-6.51 and OR = 2.12, 95% CI: 1.64-2.74, respectively) were associated with an increased risk of VD, while ApoE ε3/3 genotype and ε3 allele (OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.53-0.79 and OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.53-0.80, respectively) trended to protect against VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in ApoE ε2 allele frequency, ε2/2, ε2/3 or ε2/4 genotype between VD and controls (OR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.61-1.17; OR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.39-2.01; OR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.61-1.09 and OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.57-1.84, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results support a genetic association between ApoE polymorphism and VD in the Chinese population </plain></SENT>
