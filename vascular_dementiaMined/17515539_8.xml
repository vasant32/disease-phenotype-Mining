<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and its clinical subtypes among Chamorros on Guam aged 65 years or older and to examine associations with age, gender, education, and APOE genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Chamorros, the indigenous people of Guam, had a high incidence of ALS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> complex (PDC), in the 1950s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over the next 50 years, ALS incidence declined markedly, but PDC only slightly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of late life <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in Chamorros and its relationship to ALS/PDC are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Island-wide population-based survey of Chamorros aged 65 years or older as of January 1, 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two-stage assessment: cognitive and motor screening, followed by neurologic and psychometric evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were reviewed at consensus conference to make clinical diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 2,789 Chamorros aged 65 years or older, 73% were enrolled; 27% declined participation, died before contact or screening, or moved off Guam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The point prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> on February 1, 2004, was 12.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prevalence data for subtypes were as follows: Guam <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (clinically equivalent to AD), 8.8%; PDC, 1.5%; pure vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 1.3%; other, 0.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rose exponentially with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Low education was significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, but gender was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward higher PDC prevalence among men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The APOE epsilon4 allele was not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> among elderly Chamorros is relatively high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Guam <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is the most common diagnosis and exceeds <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Age and low education are strongly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, but gender and APOE epsilon4 are not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Incidence studies will allow risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> to be clarified </plain></SENT>
