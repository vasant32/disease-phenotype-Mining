<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined whether differences exist between groups on the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) that could assist with differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The examiners utilized the NINCDS-ADRDA and the NINDS-AIREN criteria to identify 39 probable AD and 29 probable SVaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A battery of neuropsychological tests was performed and neuroimaging was reviewed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyses revealed that the SVaD group performed significantly better on the Delayed Memory Index (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="47781">DMI</z:chebi>) and its subtests measuring Recognition, Contextual Memory, and Figure Recall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to previous research, there were no differences between groups on immediate memory tasks, and post hoc analyses revealed no differences on any other index or subtest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results also suggested that the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="47781">DMI</z:chebi> and its subtests and the Story Memory subtest of the Immediate Memory Index have better sensitivity to AD, better specificity to SVaD, and roughly equivalent positive predictive power compared with other components of the RBANS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, findings suggest that the indices and subtests of the RBANS may be limited in differentiating AD versus SVaD, except for the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="47781">DMI</z:chebi> and its subtests </plain></SENT>
