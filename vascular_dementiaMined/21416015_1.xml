<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vascular risk factors are involved in causation of both vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), account for 90% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A selective review of the literature was conducted to summarize the current evidence from clinical studies to examine the role of vascular risk factors in prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological evidence suggests that control of vascular risk factors may prevent, or at least delay, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This finding is supported to some extent by randomized controlled trial evidence for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> but not for other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, a number of methodological issues need addressing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There is a need for a randomized controlled trials (RCT) targeting multiple vascular risk factors in patients at increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; i.e., those with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The research should also explore novel risk factors and mechanisms of vascular brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For example, asymptomatic spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> have been shown to be more frequent and associated with a more <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in both AD and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
