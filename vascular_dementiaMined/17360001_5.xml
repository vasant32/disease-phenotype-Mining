<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the high sensitivity of MRI to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> it has not thus far been found to be specific for the detection of either of these pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study high b-value q-space diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) was applied to VaD and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Controls (N=4), VaD patients (N=8) and AD patients (N=6) were scanned with high b-value DWI, which emphasizes the water component which exhibits restricted diffusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VaD patients were found to present major WM loss while, in AD, the major pathology found was GM changes, as expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, WM changes in VaD and AD were of a different pattern, more specific to frontal and temporal areas in AD and more widespread in VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This pattern of WM changes may be utilized as a diagnosis criterion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conventional diffusion tensor imaging did not show significant changes between either of the groups and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate the potential of high b-value DWI in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
