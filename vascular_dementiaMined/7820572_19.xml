<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a search for pathogenic factors that might play roles in the selective vulnerability of brain regions to the lesions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023264" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SNE">Leigh's disease</z:e>, archival material from 20 cases of this condition, dying between 1975 and 1992 and aged from 4 days to 11.75 years at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, have been examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Attention was paid to the topography of the lesions, their nature and timing in the evolution of the disease, the clinico-pathological correlations and the ages of the subjects at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The following observations would appear to be explicable in terms of the present understanding that impairment of cellular energy generation is known to be defective in some, and probably <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(i) The characteristic lesion of this disease is symmetrical vasculonecrotic damage affecting several brainstem centres, the topography of which is variable and may partly depend upon the age of the individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(ii) Early features of this lesion are indistinguishable from a small partial infarction and progress similarly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The size of the damaged area is generally related to the size of the region affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There is no haemorrhagic component and haemosiderin is not at any time found, unlike the lesions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043121" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wernicke's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(iii) The process is episodic and total tissue damage is thus cumulative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More than one episode of damage may be seen in a region, changes of clearly different ages being often present together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(iv) In some regions the lesions appear to be age dependent, e.g. inferior olivary nuclei, and may be related to behavioral development and neuronal activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other regions show damage at any age, e.g. substantia nigra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>(v) Myelin and sometimes axon loss in optic pathways is usually central, the periphery being spared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This occurred in more than half the cases and may represent a partial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-like change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>(vi) The characteristic dorsal spinal column degeneration is always associated with focal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of central grey and white matter; this also resembles a partial infarction with secondary ascending degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>(vii) Massive myelin loss in the centra semiovalia occurred in one-third of the cases, with or without cavitation, often in association with spongy myelin changes elsewhere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A mild general spongy change in myelin alone occurred in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The massive lesions are focal, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-like and analogous to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>(viii) Selective <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo>, common in some <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> disorders, is not a major feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023264" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SNE">Leigh's disease</z:e>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
