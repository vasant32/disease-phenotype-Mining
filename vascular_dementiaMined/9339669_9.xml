<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study examined the usefulness of the "Practice Parameters for the Evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo>," published by the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology (1994) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Practice Parameters are stratified according to three levels of certainty (standards, guidelines, and options), and suggest indications for the use of neuroimaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed 119 consecutive cases referred for assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory loss</z:hpo> to a university-affiliated interdisciplinary clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed the diagnostic value of laboratory, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging studies above the standard history, neurologic, and mental status examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also assessed the sensitivity and specificity of four clinical indicators (i.e., early symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, noninsidious course, focal neurologic signs or symptoms, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbance</z:hpo>) for predicting the diagnostic utility of neuroimaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The largest changes in diagnostic categories between the standard and the comprehensive diagnostic process was a 9% decrease in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, a 6% increase in the diagnosis of mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (due largely to laboratory studies), and a 4% increase in the diagnosis of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (due to neuroimaging) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical indicators were 82% sensitive and 50% specific in predicting that neuroimaging studies would change the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In six cases, meaningful neuroimaging findings were not associated with any clinical indicator (5% false negatives) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 43 cases, neuroimaging provided no significant clinical findings despite the presence of an indicator (36% false positives) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this convenience sample, diagnostic accuracy was improved to a comparable degree by laboratory and neuroimaging studies, although at a significant difference in cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Use of the four clinical indicators would have reduced the frequency of neuroimaging studies by 33% but missed clinically meaningful information in 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although imperfect, the Practice Parameters represent a first step toward improving the cost effectiveness of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> work-up </plain></SENT>
