<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoproteins</z:chebi> (AI, AII, B, CII, CIII, E) of patients with Alzheimer type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) and controls (C) without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were compared among the three groups (AD, VD, C) and 15 correlation coefficients among the 6 measured items of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoproteins</z:chebi> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum levels of apo CII were significantly lower in AD group compared with VD or C groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of apo B, CIII and E were significantly lower in AD group compared with VD group, but not with C group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyses of correlations among the items of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoproteins</z:chebi> revealed high significant correlations between apo E and/or apo CII and other items in AD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoproteins</z:chebi> such as apo CII, as well as apo E, might be involved in the pathogenesis of AD </plain></SENT>
