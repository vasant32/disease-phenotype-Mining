<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We investigated the ability to discriminate between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), and between AD and non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> using the program "easy Z score imaging system" (eZIS) developed by Matsuda et al., for the diagnosis of very early AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 201 patients, we investigated 12 patients with AD, 10 with VaD, and 9 with non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, who underwent brain perfusion single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi>-99m ethyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32457">cysteinate</z:chebi> dimer (99mTc-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp>) between February 2005 and September 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of the indicators of specific volume of interest (VOI) analysis, namely, severity, extent, and ratio were evaluated for the distinction of AD from VaD and non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the criteria for severity, extent, and ratio between AD and non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases and in the ratio between AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between AD and non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, the sensitivity and specificity of severity were 100% and 45%, respectively, using the cutoff value of 1.19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When using the cutoff value of 14.2 for extent, the sensitivity and specificity were both 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using the cutoff value of 2.22 for ratio, the sensitivity of 42% and specificity of 100% were demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When comparing AD with VaD, using the cutoff value of 2.22 for ratio, the sensitivity and specificity were 42% and 100%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using the cutoff value of 1.5 for ratio, the sensitivity and specificity between AD and VaD were 92% and 80%, respectively, thereby showing the best results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The specific VOI analysis program of AD using specific voxel-based Z score maps is not influenced by interobserver differences among radiologists and is useful to discriminate AD from VaD and non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the setting of the cutoff value at each institution and comparison with original and eZIS images are suggested to distinguish better AD from VaD </plain></SENT>
