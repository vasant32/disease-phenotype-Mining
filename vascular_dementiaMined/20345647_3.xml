<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endothelin-converting enzyme-1 and 2 (ECE-1 and ECE-2) are expressed in endothelial cells and neurones, respectively, and both cleave 'big endothelin' to produce the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 (ET-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ECE-1 and ECE-2 also degrade Aβ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AD patients have regionally reduced microvascular blood flow in the brain, with impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation and cerebrovascular autoregulation, and abnormal production of ET-1 has been demonstrated in mice overexpressing amyloid precursor protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We recently found ECE-2 mRNA and protein to be elevated in the brain in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro, expression of ECE-2 was upregulated by Aβ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our aims for this study were to examine expression of ECE-1 (which has 57% homology with ECE-2) in temporal cortex from patients with AD, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the distribution of ECE-1 with immunohistochemistry, and measured ECE-1 mRNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ECE-1 protein levels were measured by western blot, and results analysed before and after adjustment for factor VIII-related antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We showed ECE-1 to be in vascular endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We did not find significant differences in ECE-1 mRNA or protein levels (either full-length ECE-1 or the soluble spliced variant, ECE-1sv) in AD or VaD compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that any disease-specific contribution of ECE-1 to the accumulation of Aβ or reduction in local microvascular blood flow in AD or VaD is probably small, with abnormal production of ET-1 being more likely to reflect Aβ-mediated upregulation of ECE-2 </plain></SENT>
