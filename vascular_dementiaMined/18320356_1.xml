<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association of LIGHT promoter with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> induced by such <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined transcription factor binding sites altered by promoter SNPs using transcription factor prediction programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six common haplotypes composed of the selected SNPs (C-770T, G-607T, G-543A, and A-399G) were used for the assay of reporter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most frequent haplotype construct, CGGA, induced the highest luciferase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The haplotype TTGA showed the lowest expression with 0.39-fold activity (P &lt; 0.001) of CGGA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The substitution from C to T at the locus of C-770T (TGGA) decreased the reporter activity by 47% (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The SNPs and haplotypes were further investigated to see their association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in 455 controls and 478 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant association with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was shown in the allele T of C-770T (odds ratio [OR] = 1.54; P &lt; 0.05) and the haplotype TTGA (OR = 10.59; P &lt; 0.05) in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We concluded that the allele T of C-770T and the haplotype TTGA of the promoter SNPs in LIGHT gene might decrease the expression of LIGHT and subsequently increase the susceptibility to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in females </plain></SENT>
