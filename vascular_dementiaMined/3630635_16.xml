<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A series of 79 patients with multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MID) were divided into 2 groups designated cortical MID and subcortical MID, according to whether the computed tomography (CT) scan showed the presence or absence of cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and an absent to mild or moderate to severe degree of white matter low attenuation (WMLA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cortical MID was characterized by repeated atherothrombotic and cardiogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, moto-sensory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, a severer degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, and abrupt <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of cognitive failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subcortical MID typically showed the following features: lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002483'>bulbar signs</z:hpo> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo>, pure motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000712'>emotional lability</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>WMLA was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with subcortical MID but also in over 60% of those with cortical MID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the 2 groups CT scans showed equal frequencies of deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When divided according to severity of WMLA, 92% of patients in the cortical MID group and 44% of those in the subcortical MID group were found to have at least one cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> on the CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although cortical and subcortical MID differed in several clinical features, they did not show major differences in the risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and clearly overlapped each other as regards ischaemic scores and the findings in neurological examinations and CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is still an open question whether cortical MID and subcortical MID, including the lacunar state and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e>, are 2 distinct entities or merely represent the expression of biological variation while having the same etiopathogenesis </plain></SENT>
