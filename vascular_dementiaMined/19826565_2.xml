<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The most important treatment for subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (SVaD) is controlling the blood pressure (BP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the few studies that have investigated the relationships between diurnal BP rhythm and subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> have produced inconclusive results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the study presented here, the 24-hour BP values of three groups of subjects-patients with subcortical vascular mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (SvMCI), patients with SVaD, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls-were compared using working criteria and 24-hour ambulatory BP (ABP) monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects (42 patients with SVaD, 37 patients with SvMCI, and 30 controls) were selected according to the study's inclusion/exclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects underwent brain magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography, detailed neuropsychological testing, and 24-hour ABP monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of nondippers differed markedly between the control group and both the SVaD and SvMCI groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Loss of nocturnal dipping was significantly associated with SVaD [odds ratio (OR), 4.827; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07-12.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It was found that SVaD is associated with loss of nocturnal BP dipping combined with <z:mp ids='MP_0006265'>increased pulse pressure</z:mp> and systolic BP (SBP) variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Correction of these factors could therefore be important in the prevention of SVaD, independent of measures used to reduce BP </plain></SENT>
