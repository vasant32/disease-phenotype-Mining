<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An association between hemorheological alterations (i.e., whole-blood and plasma hyperviscosity, reduced erythrocyte deformability, increased red cell aggregation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011899'>hyperfibrinogenemia</z:hpo> and increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase protein levels) and the mild stage of senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) was suggested in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011899'>hyperfibrinogenemia</z:hpo> and the increase of erytrhocyte aggregation were correlated with the increased generation and release of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma (spontaneous release and IL-2-modulated release) from natural killer (NK) lymphocytes (CD16+, CD56+, CD3- cells) of patients with DAT; whereas a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytokine release from NK cells was found in healthy old subjects and in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The in vitro and in vivo administration of the hemorheologic drug pentoxifylline (PTX) significantly reduced spontaneous and IL-2-modulated cytokine overproduction from NK cells (in vitro effects with 500 U/ml and 1000 U/ml/NK cells) and improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the hemorheological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data suggest that disturbances of cerebrovascular flow and of hemorheology could be considered a negative component related to the pathogenesis and progression of DAT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association between hemorheological changes and alterations of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma release from NK may indicate a potential immunorheologic mechanism associated with cerebrovascular damage in DAT and could suggest the use of vascular protective drugs as support of the main pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapy of AD </plain></SENT>
