<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To this end, eight cases of HSD and ten cases of HS associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FTLD</z:e>-U were studied with Nissl and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi>-Schiff stains to assess <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> and corpora amylacea, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sections were immunostained with antibodies to glial fibrillary acidic protein, HLA-DR and synaptophysin and immunoreactivity was measured with image analysis in CA1 and the subiculum of each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, sections were immunostained with antibodies to 4-R tau to determine the presence of argyrophilic grains </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Corpora amylacea tended to be more frequent in HSD than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FTLD</z:e>-U, but there was no difference in frequency of argyrophilic grains </plain></SENT>
