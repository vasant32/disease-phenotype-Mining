<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined the spectrophotometric measurement of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone derivatives formed by reactions with protein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyls</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The level of metal-ion-catalyzed oxidation proteins in the aged patients both with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was high in comparison to the healthy adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> showed lower amount of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone deriviates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Low levels of metal-ion-catalysed protein oxidation strongly correlated with the degree of psychoorganic disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The elderly persons with both and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> showed a high level of plasma nonenzymatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> scavenging in comparison with the healthy adult ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We discovered an imbalance between enzymatic and nonenzymatic components of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The latter indicates that the oxidative modification of brain tissue proteins probably plays an important role in aging and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mental disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
