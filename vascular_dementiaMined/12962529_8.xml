<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous results from a 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international, multicentre study of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38323,38324">cholinomimetic</z:chebi> galantamine in patients with probable vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> with cerebrovascular disease) showed significant cognitive, behavioural and functional benefits in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, results of a 6-month, open-label extension of this study confirmed that patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> with cerebrovascular disease may benefit from galantamine therapy for at least 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of the current analysis was to determine if the long-term cognitive benefits of galantamine seen in the above-mentioned study are influenced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> type (probable vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> vs <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> with cerebrovascular disease) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: A post hoc sub-analysis of a 6-month, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study and a subsequent 6-month, open-label extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with probable vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> with cerebrovascular disease were treated with galantamine (Reminyl) 24 mg/day for 12 months (6 months double-blind and 6 months open-label) or placebo for 6 months (double-blind) followed by galantamine 24 mg/day for 6 months (open-label) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changes in scores on the 11-item <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog/11) were assessed at months 6, 7.5 and 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean changes from baseline were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with probable vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> treated with galantamine for 6 or 12 months showed significant improvements in ADAS-cog/11 scores versus baseline, which were maintained at the end of the 12-month study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> with cerebrovascular disease continuously treated with galantamine maintained the cognitive abilities seen at baseline for at least 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> with cerebrovascular disease who were switched from placebo to open-label galantamine therapy for 6 months demonstrated cognitive benefits, but these benefits were significantly less than those observed in patients treated with galantamine continuously for the 12-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Galantamine was well tolerated throughout the entire 12-month study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the drug is efficacious for such common forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> as vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> with cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, some patients benefit from galantamine therapy that is initiated early, soon after diagnosis, and continued for at least 1 year </plain></SENT>
