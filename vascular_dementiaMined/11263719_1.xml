<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is well known that abnormalities in the brain <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> system exist in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was performed in order to investigate whether a peripheral <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> system marker, the platelet 5-HT2A receptor, is affected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), 13 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 40 healthy controls were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in receptor density for 5-HT2A receptor binding between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Affinity of the radioligand to the receptor was significantly lower in AD than in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and in the controls (p = .006 and p = .003, respectively), whereas there was no significant difference between the vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> group and the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 12 patients, treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> was started due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This treatment significantly reduced the Behavioral Pathology in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Rating Scale scores (p = .001), but did not affect the platelet 5-HT2A receptor status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between 5-HT2A receptor status before treatment and the therapeutic effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study indicates that platelet 5-HT2A receptor status is of limited value as a peripheral marker in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
