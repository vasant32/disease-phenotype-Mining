<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The identification of a novel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> susceptibility locus at 9p21.3 has recently generated great interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we sought to determine whether a common genetic variant (tagged by rs1333049, G/C) in the 9p21.3 locus-that has been previously linked to an increased vascular risk-might influence the susceptibility to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (LOAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A cohort of 200 VaD patients, 407 LOAD patients and 405 cognitively healthy controls were genotyped for rs1333049 using a fluorogenic 5' nuclease assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the C allele of rs1333049 was significantly higher in VaD (62.2%, P=0.005) and LOAD (60.7%, P=0.004) patients than in controls (53.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for the APOE ε4 carrier status and other vascular risk factors, the C allele of rs1333049 remained significantly associated with both VaD (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.07-1.77, P&lt;0.01) and LOAD (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.04-1.55, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Altogether, our data indicate for the first time that the C allele of rs1333049 in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> susceptibility locus is associated with VaD and LOAD, independent of traditional risk factors and the APOE ε4 genotype </plain></SENT>
