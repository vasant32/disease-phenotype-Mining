<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of the present study is to elucidate the pathophysiology of nondemented hypertensive patients with leukoaraiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed clinical and neuroradiological studies, including <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography, in eight hypertensive patients with leukoaraiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four patients were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e>, and two among the other four who were not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> at the first examination developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction angiography of the cervical and intracranial arteries demonstrated stenotic lesions in only one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were markedly reduced in the white matter (59-67% of control values) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, cerebral blood flow in the white matter of patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was reduced less markedly (74% of control), oxygen extraction fraction in the white matter was significantly increased (130% of control), and oxygen metabolism remained at almost-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels not only in the white matter but also in the cortical area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo>-caused arteriosclerotic changes of the long penetrating medullary arteries may cause misery perfusion and later ischemic damage in the periventricular white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preserved oxygen metabolism in hypertensive patients with leukoaraiosis may represent the early stage of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger</z:e> type </plain></SENT>
