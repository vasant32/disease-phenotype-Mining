<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The 5,092 participants, who were 65 years old or older, were screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on the results of this screen, 1,002 participants (329 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 673 without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) underwent comprehensive neuropsychiatric examinations and were rated on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, a widely used method for ascertainment and classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-associated mental and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral disturbances</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 329 participants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 214 (65%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 62 (19%) had vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 53 (16%) had another <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnosis; 201 (61%) had exhibited one or more mental or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral disturbances</z:hpo> in the past month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>Apathy</z:hpo> (27%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (24%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> (24%) were the most common in participants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These disturbances were almost four times more common in participants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> than in those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only modest differences were observed in the prevalence of mental or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral disturbances</z:hpo> in different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or at different stages of illness: participants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> were more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000746'>delusions</z:hpo> and less likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>Agitation</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> and aberrant motor behavior were more common in participants with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of their findings in this large community population of elderly people, the authors conclude that a wide range of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-associated mental and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral disturbances</z:hpo> afflict the majority of individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because of their frequency and their adverse effects on patients and their caregivers, these disturbances should be ascertained and treated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
