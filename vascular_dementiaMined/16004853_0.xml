<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This article discusses the most relevant recent evidence on the prevention and treatment of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> from epidemiologic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is the most common form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and remains the only one that is preventable, although most of our knowledge about primary and secondary prevention of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> comes from direct extrapolation from works in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, at present there are no approved therapeutic agents for the treatment of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, however, a number of reasonable studies on vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> have been available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is clear that rigorous control of vascular risk factors is important in primary and secondary prevention of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and perhaps in ameliorating its mild form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A rational therapeutic approach to the treatment of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> should be based on an understanding of its broad clinical spectrum and the diverse causes that may be responsive to currently available treatments </plain></SENT>
