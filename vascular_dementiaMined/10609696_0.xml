<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different types of VaD can be identified according to different criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> might be one of the causes of the controversial results observed, up to now, in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10) explicitly identified subcortical VaD as a well-defined subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities of white matter are clearly detectable with computed tomography or magnetic resonance scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinicoradiological association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, blood <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and other vascular risk factors, extensive white matter lesions, and small subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> might be considered as a clinical univocal entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following the encouraging results of a preliminary pilot study, the above-mentioned criteria were followed to define a population of patients to be enrolled in a double-blind, parallel-groups, placebo-controlled clinical trial with nimodipine, which has been proposed as a drug that can improve cognitive functions in patients with VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The paper discusses the protocol design of this ongoing trial and its main entry criteria, with particular emphasis on the definition of the population to be enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Implication for future trials in subcortical VaD are discussed further </plain></SENT>
