<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While each has its own distinguishing features and by definition <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> impact upon day to day functioning, no random community derived sample has examined clinical features as defined by gait and balance abnormalities and compared disability ratings of the three <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six hundred and forty-seven community dwelling subjects participated in the Sydney Older Persons Study and of these 537 participated in a medical assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these 537,482 informants rated disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gait and balance abnormalities of the three major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> were identified and the association of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> with disability examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The three major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> showed evidence of both slowing and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> in gait and balance tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was maximal in those with PDD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed evidence of disability that was maximal in those with PDD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study has identified that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait abnormalities</z:hpo> are present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> to a varying degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is hypothesised that the varying levels of disability observed are a consequence of the varying levels of motor impairment, resulting in greater levels of disability in those with PDD </plain></SENT>
