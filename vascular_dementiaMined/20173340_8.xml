<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the more than two dozen vascular risk factors already identified for AD, are <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, which may exert their pathology by chronically lowering <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> during aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We propose and plan to initiate a clinical study to screen middle-aged, cognitively intact individuals, with carotid artery ultrasound and echocardiography to identify potentially progressive pathology in the heart and carotid artery that is considered modifiable with optimal medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This clinical strategy, if found effective in preventing pathologic conditions suspected of contributing to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, could significantly reduce AD prevalence if applied on a wide scale and help promote healthier mental and physical aging while providing a compelling economic benefit to society </plain></SENT>
