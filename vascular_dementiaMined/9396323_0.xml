<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>Falls</z:hpo> and fall-related fractures were studied in 154 ambulatory patients who were admitted to a geriatric intermediate nursing facility with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (DAT) or mixed Alzheimer and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MIX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Mini-Mental State (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi>) was used for the evaluation of cognitive status, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Behavior Disturbance Scale (DBD) was used as a behavioral parameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate problematic behavior in walking, a derivative scale (DBD-W) was developed from the DBD by choosing three items relevant to wandering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the 3 months of observation, 61 patients fell more than once; 15 of them experienced fractures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> scores were higher in non fallers, fallers who did not sustain fractures and those complicated with fractures, in that order, and the difference between the non fallers and fallers with fractures was statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the subjects were divided into three subgroups on the basis of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> scores, there was a trend toward a higher ratio of fallers or those complicated with fractures in the subgroup with the lower <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The DBD and DBD-W scores were not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> or fractures, although fallers had a slightly higher DBD or DBD-W score than non fallers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the risk of falling or fracture becomes higher with the advance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in institutionalized ambulatory patients with DAT or MIX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings also suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral disturbances</z:hpo> are not necessarily associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> or fractures </plain></SENT>
