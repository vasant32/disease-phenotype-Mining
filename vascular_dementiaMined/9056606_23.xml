<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA) was conducted in communities and institutions in 10 Canadian provinces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One objective of the study was to study risk factors for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a population-based case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It included 129 patients clinically diagnosed with VaD with duration of symptoms no more than 3 years and 535 control subjects, frequency matched by age group, study center, and residence in community or institution, who were clinically confirmed to be cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using unconditional logistic regression for potential risk factors for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Risk of VaD was associated with history of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR, 2.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.29 to 3.35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other significantly elevated ORs were seen for history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085762" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="aca">alcohol abuse</z:e> (2.45), history of heart condition (1.71), use of aspirin (3.10), and occupational exposure to pesticides and <z:chebi fb="95" ids="24527">herbicides</z:chebi> (2.60), as well as liquid plastic or rubber (2.59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The OR for less than 6 years of education compared with 10 or more years was 4.02 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed some previously reported risk factors for VaD, such as history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Higher levels of education seemed to lower the risk or delay <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms of VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Use of aspirin may be a predictor of survival rather than a risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The occupational associations, particularly with pesticides and fertilizers, need further study </plain></SENT>
