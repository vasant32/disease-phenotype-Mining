<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the functional performance of two major subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), by the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), and to understand the need for assistance in performing activities of daily living </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects comprised 64 AD and 21 VaD patients who were recruited from two epidemiologic studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with a total of 3,931 community residents aged 65 years and above in southern Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was similar between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean score for AD was 82.7 and for VaD was 56.5 for total FIM (p &lt; 0.05), 61.6 and 41.7 for the motor dimension (p &lt; 0.05), and 21.1 and 15.7 for the cognitive dimension (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences (p &lt; 0.01) between AD and VaD in six FIM items and borderline or marginal significance (p &lt; 0.05) in most of the FIM items </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For AD patients, stairs, lower dressing, bathing, and tub/shower transfer were the most difficult items in the motor dimension, and it was memory in the cognitive dimension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For VaD patients, bathing, upper and lower dressing, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001440'>grooming</z:mp> were the most difficult items in the motor dimension, and it was problem solving in the cognitive dimension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>VaD patients were more dependent on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> FIM items and required more assistance than AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The functional performances of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients were significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity and subtypes, together accounting for 40% of the variability in total FIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, most <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients are dependent in daily activities and different types and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> lead to different disability profiles; individualized care is, therefore, most appropriate </plain></SENT>
