<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A spatio-temporal analysis has been employed on EEG signals recorded in groups of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The so-called Karhunen-Loeve analysis method was applied to four groups of subjects: 12 patients who were diagnosed as having severe AD, 8 mild AD patients, 10 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients, and 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aged controls, to obtain the spatio-temporal eigenpatterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The local difference of the global EEG pattern in mild AD patients from that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls was expanded to the frontal regions in the case of severe AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analysis showed significant bilateral temporal functioning differences and inter-hemispheric connection difficulty, along with remarkable intra-hemispheric correlation in severe AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, severe AD patients' brains exhibit only weak local connections and correlations, resulting into limited harmonious inter-hemispheric information processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results from the spatio-temporal EEG study of AD patients can be considered to be due to a change in the relative activity of the brain corresponding to the pathologic variation in AD, and the results are in accordance with reported clinical studies </plain></SENT>
