<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The distribution of APOE polymorphism was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neither the APOE epsilon4 allele nor the APOE epsilon2 allele was more prevalent in the VD patients compared with the NC subjects (P &gt; .1 by the chi 2 test), which was the case when both men and women were analyzed separately (P &gt; .1 by the chi2 test) and when young patients (75 years old or less) and old patients (more than 75 years old) were analyzed separately (P &gt; .1 by the chi2 test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The estimated statistical power was over 0.80 when the odds ratios (OR) for VD conferred to the APOE epsilon4 are assumed to be higher than 2.2 and the type I error probability is set at 0.05, which is much higher than the power of the previous studies on the VD/APOE association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the results suggested that APOE epsilon4 allele does not confer the risk for VD, and even if it does, it does so very modestly </plain></SENT>
