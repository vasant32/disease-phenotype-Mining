<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accumulation of excess cholesterol in hippocampal neurons promotes the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) into amyloidogenic components with the consequence of the acceleration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conversion of cholesterol to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">24S-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi> mediated by cholesterol 24S-hydroxylase (CYP46) is the major pathway for the elimination of brain cholesterol and the maintenance of brain cholesterol homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">24S-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi> levels differ between patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI), and cognitively intact control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma and CSF concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">24S-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi> and cholesterol in 32 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), 11 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, seven patients with MCI, and seven cognitively intact control subjects were measured by combined gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show elevated concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">24S-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi> in the CSF of AD patients and we interpret this finding as a consequence of increased cholesterol turnover in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The observed influence of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E epsilon4 (APOE4) allele on CSF <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">24S-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi> concentrations with a gene-dosage effect suggests the existence of a link between the AD risk factor APOE4 and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> cholesterol metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The elevation of CSF <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">24S-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi> appears to occur early in the disease process, since patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> had also increased CSF concentrations of this compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We believe that the CSF concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">24S-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi> is altered in AD-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> and thus, CSF <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">24S-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi> may be a marker for monitoring the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and progression of the disease </plain></SENT>
