<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a 6 months follow-up on the elderly to evaluate the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> on the prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the residents in a Korean geriatric institution, a total of 141 elderly residents were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those residents who had geriatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scale (GDS) scores over 20 were considered as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The subjects were assessed at baseline and at 6 months later with the Korean Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE), Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating (CDR) and Barthel index (BI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 141 subjects, the changes of the K-MMSE, CDR and BI scores were first compared between the depressed and non-depressed groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Then, for the 58 depressed subjects subdivided into three groups (36 subjects in the non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> group, 14 subjects in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) group and 8 subjects in the vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) group), the changes of the scores among the three groups were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects, the changes of the K-MMSE and CDR scores were more severe in the depressed group than in the non-depressed group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the 58 depressed subjects, the changes were significantly different among the three groups (p=0.02 for the K-MMSE, p&lt;0.001 for the CDR), and the changes were the most severe in the VaD group </plain></SENT>
