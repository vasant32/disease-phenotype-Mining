<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) patterns in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> (BD) patients using single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SPECT data on 22 patients with BD were analyzed using three-dimensional stereotactic surface projections (3D-SSP) and were compared with those of 22 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>rCBF patterns in patients with BD were different from those with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The BD group had greater CBF reduction in the frontal and anterior cingulate cortices, while the AD group had greater CBF reduction in the temporoparietal and posterior cingulate cortices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the rCBF pattern of each patient was more variable, and could be divided into three patterns: anterior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e>, posterior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e>, and diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A distinct CBF reduction in the temporoparietal and/or posterior cingulate cortices, indistinguishable from the CBF pattern observed in AD, was demonstrated in 8 of 22 (36%) patients with BD, in particular there was bilateral hemispheric involvement with a diffuse hypoperfusion pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although no pathological confirmation could be performed, some of the BD patients with CBF reduction in the posterior cerebral cortices may represent additional changes in the brain due to AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the future, a longitudinal study including pathology will be needed to determine whether these patients have coexisting AD pathology </plain></SENT>
