<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the frequency of polymorphisms in the genes coding for interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-1beta and the IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (RN) and their genotype associations with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> AD and VaD were determined in a Japanese-American cohort of men (n=931) participating in the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study (HAAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant association was found between the IL-1beta (-511) and IL-1RN (+2018) polymorphisms and AD, suggesting that these variants confer an increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Possessing the IL-1beta (-511) T/T genotype was also associated with VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the IL-1beta (+3953) frequency among the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results support the hypothesis that certain genetic variations contained within the IL-1 gene family contribute to the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
