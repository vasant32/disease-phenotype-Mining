<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine cholinesterase (ChE) activity during AD progression and whether ChE changes associate to other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>, ChE activity was measured in lymphocytes, erythrocytes and platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects underwent extensive medical and neuropsychological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both early-AD and AD patients had lower AChE activity in lymphocytes compared to control subjects (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, erythrocyte AChE activity was higher in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Low ChE activity in lymphocytes was the best discriminator for AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because it was already low at very early stages of AD, ChE could be helpful as an early biomarker of differential diagnosis for the follow-up of patients during their early stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> before a clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is established </plain></SENT>
