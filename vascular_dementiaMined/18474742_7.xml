<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Understanding how each disease contributes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is essential from both a pathophysiologic and diagnostic perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To elucidate how baseline cognitive function (episodic memory and executive function) and brain <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> (white matter hyperintensities and hippocampal volume) are associated with baseline (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography-1 [PET1]) and longitudinal (PET2) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in 38 subjects older than 55 years ranging from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional regression analyses across subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Multicenter, university-based study of subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Regional cerebral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism was the primary outcome, with the major hypotheses that memory and hippocampal volume are related to temporoparietal hypometabolism while executive function and white matter hyperintensities correlate with frontal lobe hypometabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Low baseline hippocampal volume predicted longitudinal development (PET2) of medial temporal hypometabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lower memory was associated with parietal and cingulate hypometabolism at PET1, which increased at the 2-year-follow-up (PET2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Executive function was associated with frontal and temporoparietal hypometabolism at PET1 but only with frontal hypometabolism at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>White matter hyperintensities predicted hypometabolism over time in the frontoparietal regions, predicting a rate of metabolic change (PET1 - PET2/time) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low baseline episodic memory and hippocampal volume predict the metabolic alterations associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, whereas elevated baseline white matter hyperintensities predict a different pattern of metabolic decline that is plausibly associated with cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
