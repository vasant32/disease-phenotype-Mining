<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rat model was made by 4-vessel occlusion method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four groups, a sham operation group, a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group, a model group and an auricular acupuncture group were set up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After acupuncture was given at auricular points, Brain and Kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis, behavioural observation and computer image analysis were made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Auricular acupuncture could decrease significantly the beta-amyloid protein (A beta) immunoreactivive neurons and increase its average optical density in the parietal cortex of the VD rats (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Auricular acupuncture can reduce or inhibit the over-production of Abeta in the brain, so as to improve the learning and memory capacity of the VD model rat </plain></SENT>
