<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To assess nonlinear EEG activity in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), the authors estimated the correlation dimension (D2) and the first positive Lyapunov exponent (L1) of the EEGs in both patients and age-matched healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EEGs were recorded in 15 electrodes from 12 AD patients, 12 VaD patients, and 14 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The AD patients had significantly lower D2 values than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects, (P &lt; H &gt; 0.05), except at the F7 and the O1 electrodes, and the VaD patients, except at the C3 and the C4 electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The VaD patients had relatively increased values of D2 and L1 compared with the AD patients, and rather higher values of D2 than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects at the F7, F4, F8, Fp2, O1, and O2 electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The L1 values of the EEGs were also lower for the AD patients than for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects, except in the O1 and the O2 channels, and for the VaD patients at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The L1 values were higher for the VaD patients than for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects (F3, F4, F8, O1, and O2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the authors detected that the VaD patients had an uneven distribution of D2 values over the regions than the AD patients and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects, although the statistics do not confirm this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, AD patients had uniformly lower D2 values in most regions, indicating that AD patients have less complex temporal characteristics of the EEG in entire regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These nonlinear analyses of the EEG may be helpful in understanding the nonlinear EEG activity in AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
