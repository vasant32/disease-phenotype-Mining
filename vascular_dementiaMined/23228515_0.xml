<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The advent of sensitive diagnostic tests, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30860">methylmalonic acid</z:chebi> assays, has revealed a surprisingly high prevalence of a more subtle 'subclinical' form of B(12) deficiency, particularly within the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is often associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Metabolic evidence of B(12) deficiency is also reported in association with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> including vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> and multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is possible that these clinical associations reflect compromised vitamin B(12) metabolism due to such stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Physicians are also increasingly aware of considerable inter-individual variation in the clinical response to B(12) replacement therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed to determine to what extent this is attributable to genetic determinants of vitamin B(12) absorption, distribution and cellular uptake </plain></SENT>
