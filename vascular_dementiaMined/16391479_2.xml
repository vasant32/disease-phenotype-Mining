<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have indicated that lesions in the temporopolar, medial frontopolar areas and external capsule are frequently seen in Caucasian patients with CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it remains unclear whether magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging findings are helpful in diagnosing small artery disease outside countries with Caucasian populations, since CADASIL is rare despite the high prevalence of small artery disease in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined 58 patients with small artery disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom were devoid of major vessel occlusion or severe stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients included 7 patients from 3 families with CADASIL, 27 nondemented patients with extensive leukoaraiosis (LA) and 24 patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On T(2)-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images, hyperintensities in the temporopolar areas were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 patients with CADASIL, whereas these lesions were observed in only 1 subject from each of the nondemented LA and BD groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hyperintensities in the medial frontopolar areas were seen in 4 of the 7 patients with CADASIL (57%) and in 14 of the 24 patients with BD (58%), and were more frequent than in the nondemented LA group (4 of the 27 patients; 15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, hyperintensities in the external capsule were frequently observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, temporopolar lesions can also serve as diagnostic markers for CADASIL in non-Caucasian patients </plain></SENT>
