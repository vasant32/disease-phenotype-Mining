<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The neuropathological findings in 18 elderly, undemented subjects free of cerebrovascular disease were compared with 19 elderly undemented subjects who had cerebrovascular disease (many of whom had had a "<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>") and 24 elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> subjects who had cerebrovascular disease, but no other pathology to account for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cases in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups were selected for absence or no more than very mild Alzheimer type pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microvascular brain damage in the form of severe cribriform change and associated subcortical white matter damage and microinfarction were correlated with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Severe cribriform change was much more common and microinfarction somewhat more common in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> group with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> than the undemented group with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> (P=0.0006 and P=0.031 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other findings of note were that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085220" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congophilic angiopathy</z:e> had a greater prevalence in the vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> group than the control group, single cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were more common in the group who were undemented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> than in the group with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> (P=0.0028), and the last group lacked evidence of macroscopic infarction more often than the first (P=0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a non-significant trend for the ratio of infarcted:uninfarcted tissue in one cerebral hemisphere to be higher in the group with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> than in the group with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> but no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Microvascular disease, not macroscopic infarction, was the chief substrate of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in this series of cases </plain></SENT>
