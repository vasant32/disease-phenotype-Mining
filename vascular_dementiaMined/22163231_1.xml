<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Novel biomarkers are important for identifying as well as differentiating subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) at an early stage in the disease process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In two independent cohorts, a multiplex immunoassay was utilized to analyze 90 proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients and patients at risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The levels of several CSF proteins were increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> and its incipient state, and in moderate-to-severe AD compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, some CSF proteins were altered in AD, but not in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of heart-type fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP) were consistently increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> but only in some of their incipient states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In summary, these results support the notion that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> and AD are driven by different pathophysiological mechanisms reflected in the CSF protein profile and that H-FABP in CSF is a general marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
