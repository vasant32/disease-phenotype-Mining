<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From brain autopsies performed on subjects enrolled in the Mayo Alzheimer Center between 1991 and 2003, cases with neuropathological diagnoses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FTLD</z:e> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neuropathological diagnoses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FTLDs</z:e> were based on consensus criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FTLD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The initial clinical histories, neuropsychological test results, brain imaging studies, and initial clinical diagnoses were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 34 pathological <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FTLD</z:e> cases among 433 subjects who underwent autopsy; 29 of these 34 cases were diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FTLD</z:e> antemortem based on the sum of clinical, neuropsychological, and imaging features (sensitivity, 85%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The specificity was 99% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 34 cases with pathological <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FTLD</z:e>, 27 (79%) had clinical histories diagnostic of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FTLD</z:e> syndrome, 20 (62%) had neuropsychological profiles consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FTLD</z:e>, 17 (50%) had magnetic resonance scans consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FTLD</z:e>, and 7 of 8 who had functional imaging studies had ones consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FTLD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In those with incorrect antemortem diagnoses, three were thought to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, one was considered hard to classify, and one was diagnosed with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The antemortem consensus diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FTLD</z:e> was moderately sensitive and very specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With experienced clinicians and awareness of the unique manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FTLD</z:e>, accurate antemortem diagnosis was feasible </plain></SENT>
