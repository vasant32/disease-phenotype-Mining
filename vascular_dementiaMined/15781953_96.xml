<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors conducted a prospective study to determine the association between physical activity and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The US study population comprised 3,375 men and women aged 65 years or older, free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at baseline, who participated in the Cardiovascular Health Cognition Study in 1992-2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Leisure-time energy expenditure and an activity index reflecting number of different physical activities were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyses were based on Cox proportional hazards models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 480 incident cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> over an average of 5.4 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After multivariate adjustment, participants in the highest quartile of physical energy expenditure had a relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of 0.85 (95% confidence interval: 0.61, 1.19) compared with those in the lowest quartile, and participants engaging in &gt;or=4 activities had a relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of 0.51 (95% confidence interval: 0.33, 0.79) compared with those engaging in 0-1 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These associations were more marked in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E genotype (APOE) epsilon4 allele noncarriers but were absent in carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A similar pattern was observed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mechanisms to explain the observed relations deserve further study </plain></SENT>
