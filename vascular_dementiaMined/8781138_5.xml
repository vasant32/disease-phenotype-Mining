<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects underwent the Mini-Mental State Examination of Taiwan, version 1 (MMSE-T1), for assessing the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were subdivided into two groups, one with mild to moderate (group I, MMSE-T1 scores: 11-24, n=11), and the other with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (group II, MMSE-T1 scores: below 10, n=13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>White matter degeneration was evaluated with densitometric methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Loss of brain parenchyma was estimated with seven linear measurements (Evan's ratio, third ventricle ratio, width of temporal horn tip, anterior-posterior length of temporal horn, anterior-posterior length of Sylvian fissure and width of frontal interhemispheric fissure) by CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow was determined with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi>-99m hexamethylpropylene <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> (HMPAO) single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission tomography (SPET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In neuroimaging studies, subcortical leuco-araiosis was localized at the frontal region in group I patients and scattered diffusely in group II patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>99mTc-HMPAO SPET analysis revealed reduction of regional cerebral blood flow in the frontal lobe in group I patients and widespread reduction of regional cerebral blood flow in group II patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A correlation between frontal leuco-araiosis and perfusion defect of the frontal pole was demonstrated in group I patients, showing findings typical of <z:hpo ids='HP_0007123'>subcortical dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in frontal atrophic measurements between group I patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ratios of volumes of lost brain parenchyma and leuco-araiosis were significantly higher in group II patients than in the age-matched controls, corresponding to a diffuse cerebral perfusion defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that patients with VDBT have early frontal lobe involvement with posterior progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with mild VDBT are more likely to show reduction of frontal cerebral blood flow and leuco-araiosis, while those with severe VDBT are more likely to have diffuse leuco-araiosis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
