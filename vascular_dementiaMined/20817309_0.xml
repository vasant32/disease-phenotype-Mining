<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether addition of EEG would improve accuracy of a logistic model that uses neuropsychological assessment and cardiovascular history to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) as a single group, we collected data and constructed logistic models from a sample of 78 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adults and 33 patients (aged 50-85 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine accuracy, we compared logistic regression results to a geriatrician's diagnosis of MCI or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> that included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that the addition of EEG (non-linear complexity) to a logistic model that included both neuropsychological assessment (ADAS-Cog) and cardiovascular history increased overall accuracy from 80% to 92% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The logistic model identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and MCI as a single group comprised of the following subgroups (with accuracies): <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (92%; 12/13), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (73%; 8/11), mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (100%; 4/4), and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (80%; 4/5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whereas the analysis is limited by small sample sizes and mixing of diverse pathologies, the findings do provide support that the subgroups may share changes in neuropsychological, cardiovascular, and electroencephalographic factors (specifically ADAS-Cog total score, cardiovascular history, and EEG complexity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the study results provide support that EEG might complement the clinician's evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and MCI </plain></SENT>
