<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Study procedures entailed standardized psychiatric, neurological, and neuropsychological evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer type (DAT) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were based on criteria of the National Institute of Neurological and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009460" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Communicative Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> and Related Disorders Association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of alcohol-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (ARD) was based on extensive review of medical history to assess before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085762" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="aca">alcohol abuse</z:e> and stabilization or improvement in cognitive functioning following institutionalization in conjunction with no other identifiable cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ARD comprised 24% of this population compared with DAT (35%), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (19%), and other causes (22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ARD group was, on average, 10 years younger than the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It had nearly twice the average length of institutionalization and had milder <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> on both clinical ratings and neuropsychological tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of ARD was present in the medical records for only 25% of patients in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that ARD may be more common than previously suspected in the distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> in long-term care facilities </plain></SENT>
