<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although primary causes of Alzheimer's and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are unknown, the importance of preceding vascular lesions is widely accepted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there is strong evidence for the involvement of autoimmune mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the presence of agonistic autoantibodies directed at adrenergic receptors in the circulation of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 59% of these patients, agonistic autoantibodies against the α(1) -adrenergic receptor and the β(2) -adrenergic receptor were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of positive patients (66%) contained both types of autoantibodies in combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a control group of patients with neurological impairments others than Alzheimer's and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, only 17% were found to harbour these autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The autoantibodies to the α(1) -adrenergic receptor interacted preferably with the extracellular loop1 of the receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They were further studied in IgG preparations from the column regenerate of a patient who underwent immunoadsorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The α(1) -adrenergic receptor autoantibodies specifically bound to the extracellular loop1 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> of the receptor with an apparent EC(50) value of 30 nm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They mobilized intracellular calcium in a clonal cell line expressing the human form of the α(1) -adrenergic receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data support the notion that autoimmune mechanisms play a significant role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We suggest that agonistic autoantibodies to the α(1) -adrenergic and the β(2) -adrenergic receptor may contribute to vascular lesions and increased plaque formation </plain></SENT>
