<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To describe the pattern of presentation, the types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and the associated conditions in Saudi patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hospital-based study using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> 10 criteria for consensus diagnosis of cases from clinical information and results of investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> subtypes were made according to NINCDS-ADRDA, NINDS-AIREN and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> 10 criteria while CDR was used for severity grading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 77 demented patients (49 males, 28 females) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hospital frequency was 19.3/100,000 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age at presentation was 74.6 years and age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was below 65 years in 17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (51.9%), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (18.2%), mixed cases (15.6%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> (7.8%) and treatable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (5.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 3 patients were in the severe clinical stage and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were important causes of deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The hospital frequency appears to be low probably because of the relatively young population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with preponderance of AD is similar to that in western countries and intervention directed at the risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> could reduce the burden of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
