<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately two hundred pathogenic mutations have been reported within five exons (exons 3, 4, 6, 11 and 19) which accounted for 78% of known mutations in worldwide series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reported twenty-one NOTCH3 pathogenic mutations (including five novel ones) identified in 53 index Italian patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exons 4 (28%), 7 (21%) and 19 (24%) were the most frequently involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To dissect <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo>, we analyzed five haplotyped tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs1044009, rs4809030, rs10426042, rs10423702 and rs3815188) in 95 patients, 39 unaffected pedigree members and 50 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SNPs were analyzed using the Illumina VeraCode Universal Capture Beads technology by Allele Specific Primer Extension (ASPE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We identified ten different haplotypes named H1-H10; H1 was the most common haplotype in patients and controls and it was associated with at least twelve out of the twenty-one mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Detected mutations were not associated to specific haplotypes while genotyping was compatible with a possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> effect for the novel p.S396C mutation which clustered in a restricted geographical area of northeast Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results added on to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> of CADASIL and emphasized difficulties in designing algorithms for molecular diagnosis </plain></SENT>
