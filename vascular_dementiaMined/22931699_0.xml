<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD who were enrolled in AD therapy clinical trials and subsequently received an autopsy for confirmation of their diagnosis from 2000 to 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Performance on cognitive screening tests, namely Modified Mini Mental state (3MS) exam, Mini Mental state Exam (MMSE) and Functional Rating Scale (FRS) were compared between patients with pure AD and multiple pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Autopsy reports were available for 16/47 (34%) of deceased patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these 16 patients, 5 (31%) had pure AD pathology, 10 (63%) had AD with other pathology, and 1 (6%) had non-AD pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to patients with pure AD, patients with AD mixed with other pathology had poorer baseline FRS in problem-solving (p&lt;0.01) and community affairs (p&lt;0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: While the strict enrollment criteria for clinical trials identified the presence of AD pathology in the majority of cases (15/16), multiple pathology was more common than pure AD in our series of autopsied patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Premortem biomarkers that can distinguish between pure AD and AD with multiple pathology will be beneficial in future clinical trials and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patient management </plain></SENT>
