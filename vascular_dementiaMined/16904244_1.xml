<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and related neuropathologies is modified by the TGF-beta1 functional genetic variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The association of the TGF-beta1+29T--&gt;C polymorphism with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was examined in a sample of 261 cases and 491 controls from the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study, including 282 subjects with autopsy data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was assessed in 1991 and 1994 by a multi-step protocol and standardized diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analysis was adjusted for demographic and vascular factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to the TT genotype, the TC and the CC genotypes were associated with a reduced risk for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (OR(TC)=0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.1-0.9; OR(CC)=0.28, CI: 0.1-0.9), microinfarcts (OR(CC)=0.31, CI: 0.13-0.71) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> (OR(CC)=0.48, CI: 0.2-0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CC genotype was associated with an increase risk of neocortical plaques (OR(CC)=4.34, CI: 1.6-11.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These preliminary data suggest that the TGF genetic variability may be important in the risk of vascular related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
