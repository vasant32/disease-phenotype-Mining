<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of cross-cultural studies of behavioural and psychological symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (BPSD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: BPSD were examined in a consecutive series of Indian sub-continent origin and white indigenous elders admitted to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> day hospital using the BEHAVE-AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The correlates of individual BPSD in each of the two ethnic groups and the differences between the two ethnic groups were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no differences between the two groups on most of the demographic and clinical variables examined, except that Indian sub-continent elders had a greater number of children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between the two groups on the MMSE scores, BEHAVE-AD total scores and BEHAVE-AD subscale scores (with one exception) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indian sub- continent origin patients had lower scores on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0349231" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">phobias</z:e> subscale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within the Indian sub-continent origin group, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) was associated with activity disturbance and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with affective disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within the indigenous group, aggressivity was associated with males and prescription of <z:chebi fb="25" ids="35476">neuroleptics</z:chebi>, and affective disturbance with prescription of antidepressants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is a need to develop and evaluate translated versions of instruments that measure BPSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After development of these instruments there is a need for cross-cultural population-based epidemiological studies of BPSD </plain></SENT>
