<SENT sid="5" pm="?"><plain>Is this reflected by the functional coupling of fronto-parietal cortical rhythms at an early stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (mild AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Resting electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms were studied in 82 patients with mild AD and in control subjects, such as 41 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly (Nold) subjects and 25 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with AD and VaD had similar mini-mental state evaluation scores of 17-24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The functional coupling was estimated by means of the synchronization likelihood (SL) of the EEG data at electrode pairs, accounting for linear and non-linear components of that coupling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cortical rhythms of interest were delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (1 8-10.5 Hz), alpha 2 (10.5-13 Hz), beta 1 (13-20 Hz), beta 2 (20-30 Hz) and gamma (30-40 Hz) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A preliminary data analysis (Nold) showed that surface Laplacian transformation of the EEG data reduced the values of SL, possibly because of the reduction of influences due to head volume conduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the final analysis was performed on Laplacian-transformed EEG data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The SL was dominant at alpha 1 band in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Compared with the Nold subjects, patients with VaD and mild AD presented a marked reduction of SL at both fronto-parietal (delta-alpha) and inter-hemispherical (delta-beta) electrode pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The feature distinguishing the patients with mild AD with respect to patients with VaD groups was a more prominent reduction of fronto-parietal alpha 1 SL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that mild AD is characterized by an abnormal fronto-parietal coupling of the dominant human cortical rhythm at 8-10.5 Hz </plain></SENT>
