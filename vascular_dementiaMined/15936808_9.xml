<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A recent double-blind and placebo-controlled study demonstrated a beneficial effect of Choto-san, a Kampo (traditional medicine of Japan) formula, on <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the neuronal mechanism underlying the therapeutic effects of this formula remains to be clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> model, we investigated the effect of Choto-san on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> in mice to clarify its mechanism of actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> was induced by permanent occlusion of both the common carotid arteries (2VO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Choto-san and Uncaria, a major constituent of Choto-san, caused an improvement in 2VO-induced learning deficits, whereas Uncaria-free Choto-san did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effects of Choto-san and Uncaria were blocked by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8247">pirenzepine</z:chebi>, a selective muscarinic M1 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a tube-dominance test, 2VO induced increased rates of assertive behavior in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>2VO mice administered Choto-san showed significantly reduced rates of assertive behavior compared to vehicle-treated controls, whereas Uncaria-free Choto-san and Uncaria had little effect on 2VO-induced assertive behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>2VO caused a significant decrease in the level of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>) contents in the brain, and the daily administration of Choto-san or Uncaria raised the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> level to that in the sham-operated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Choto-san has an ameliorating effect on the spatial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficit</z:e> caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hypoperfusion, and that the effect is mainly attributable to Uncaria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it was suggested that the effects of Choto-san and Uncaria are at least partly mediated by stimulation of the muscarinic M1 receptor </plain></SENT>
