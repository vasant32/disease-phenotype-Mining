<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The tight junctions (TJs) are key players in the control of blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) properties, the most complex TJs in the vascular system being found in the endothelial cells of brain capillaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the main TJs proteins is occludin, which anchors plasma membranes of neighbour cells and is present in large amounts in the brain endothelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies demonstrated that disruption of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> in various pathological situations associates with changes in occludin expression, and this change could be responsible for malfunction of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore in this study, applying an immunohistochemical approach, we decided to explore the occludin expression in frontal cortex (FC) and basal ganglia in ageing control, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) brains, as far as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these pathologies associate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> and disruption of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, we found selected neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes expressing occludin, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To estimate the number of occludin-expressing neurons, we applied a stereological approach with random systematic sampling and the unbiased optical fractionator method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We report here a significant increase in ratio of occludin-expressing neurons in FC and basal ganglia regions in both AD and VD as compared to ageing controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within the cerebral cortex, occludin was selectively expressed by pyramidal neurons, which are the ones responsible for cognitive processes and affected by AD pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings could be important in unravelling new pathogenic pathways in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> disorders and new functions of occludin and TJs </plain></SENT>
