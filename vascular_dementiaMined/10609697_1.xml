<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective glial cell modulator propentofylline has been used in clinical trials involving more than 800 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These data derive from two sources: a pooled group of VaD patients from four early phase III European trials, and a multinational European/Canadian phase III study (MN 305) that features a combined randomized withdrawal/delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of progression design to evaluate the effect of propentofylline on disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the pooled studies, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R criteria, Hachinski <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> Scores, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used to select subjects with mild-to-moderate disease; in MN 305, National Institute of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>/Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN) criteria and neurologic examinations (including CT and MRI scans) were used to select patients with possible or probable VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The use of a central rater to assess cerebrovascular disease in neuroradiologic examinations for study MN 305 was considered to be a key feature for reducing the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the VaD patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the inclusion of patients with possible VaD in this trial greatly increased the number of eligible patients; subgroup analyses revealed no substantial differences between patients with probable versus possible VaD, justifying their inclusion in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VaD patients exhibited a more pronounced placebo response in global assessments compared with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> population in a parallel study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, they experienced less deterioration over time with respect to cognitive and global assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Beneficial effects of propentofylline were consistently demonstrated in the domains of cognitive and global function for both VaD populations; however, no treatment benefits could be demonstrated for activities of daily living, possibly due to factors relating to the study population/design, the lack of a validated test instrument for such patients, the caregiver-related phenomenon of "tutoring," or the nature of the disease itself </plain></SENT>
