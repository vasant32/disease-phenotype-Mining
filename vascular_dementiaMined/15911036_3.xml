<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, 1251 patients admitted to the Hacettepe University Division of Geriatric Medicine were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the mini mental state examination (MMSE), the clock drawing test (CDT) scores, the <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV and the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria and the Hachinski ischemic score (HIS), the subjects were divided into four groups: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognitive status (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> levels were measured, and we analyzed the data using chi2 and the one-way analysis of variance methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the subjects, 14.8% had low <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoproteins</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>), 58.5% had high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (TG), 73.6% had high <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoproteins</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>), and 21.6% had high <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>-a (Lp(a)) of our study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subgroups and the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> group in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The only significant relationship was between high TG levels and the AD, as well as the MCI groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and high <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> are important problems in elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels, especially of Lp(a), has recently been thought to be related with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, our study suggests the absence of such a relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The national data regarding the elderly population should be evaluated on the basis of genetic and environmental factors in each country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present study showing no significant relationship between Lp(a) and the cognitive status adds new information to the available literature </plain></SENT>
