<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The importance of vascular lesions in the white matter of the brain (WML) is viewed differently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic evaluation is determined by experience and age-associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values are not available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred fifty-two patients aged 68.8 years (range 50-89) were examined at a memory clinic using a magnetic resonance FLAIR sequence,which is sensitive for WML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The WMLs were entered with respect to size, localization, laterality, and density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The WML scores of 76 clinically and psychologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects with microangiopathic lesions and 27 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were correlated with psychological test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The contribution of local WML scores to the differentiation between age-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was calculated using logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nonparametric monotonic regression was used to analyse the age-associated WML scores of both groups, taking individual age into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The WML scores correlated linearly with the age of psychologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects but with degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> for those with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and it allowed differentiation between these two groups with an accuracy of up to 88% and specificity of approximately 95% with reference to the right frontal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The odds ratios of the general and frontal WML scores were significantly different (1,102 and 1,400, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Statistical significance of the age-associated WML scores varied for different age ranges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is possible to differentiate psychologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects with microangiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> from patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> on MRI when referring to frontal WML scores </plain></SENT>
