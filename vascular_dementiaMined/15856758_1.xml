<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previously, the distribution of white matter lesions in CADASIL has been reported to be distinct from those in patients with ischemic leukoaraiosis and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In earlier European studies, diagnostic significance of white matter lesions in the temporopolar region (Tp), medial frontopolar region (Fp) and external capsule (EC) was stressed in diagnosing CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More recently, however, high sensitivity and specificity of Tp lesions have been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Japan, prevalence of CADASIL is lower, and those of ischemic leukoaraiosis and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e>, likely related to small artery disease, are much higher than in Caucasian countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined the frequencies of CADASIL-associated lesions in 17 non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients with ischemic leukoaraiosis and 20 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> group showed a significantly lower scores for Hasegawa <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating Scale Revised (HDSR) and a higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, compared to the ischemic leukoaraiosis group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was only 1 patient with Tp lesions in each group, while Fp lesions were found in 12 % and 50% in the ischemic leukoaraiosis group and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> group, respectively, and EC lesions in 59% and 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that Tp lesions were useful diagnostic marker in diagnosing CADASIL, whereas Fp and EC lesions were non-specifically observed </plain></SENT>
