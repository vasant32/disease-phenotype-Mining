<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In our patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NMS</z:e> occurred after the additional administration of oxypertine 10 mg per day or after long time administration of LPZ 5 mg per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>It was suggested that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NMS</z:e> could occur after the administration of low dose and relatively low potential <z:chebi fb="25" ids="35476">neuroleptics</z:chebi> in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Our 3 of 5 patients showed the delayed type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NMS</z:e>, which might be relatively more frequent in senior and presenior patients than in younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In case 3, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NMS</z:e> was induced by the somatic disease (<z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>), however in other cases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NMS</z:e> was not always induced by somatic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Our 4 of 5 patients experienced some of the symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NMS</z:e>--<z:hpo ids='HP_0001954'>episodic fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002071'>extrapyramidal symptoms</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262385" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic instabilities</z:e>--before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NMS</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Due to the fact that our 2 of 5 patients died, it was suggested that the prognosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NMS</z:e> patients in presenium and senium tends to be much worse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>It is important to find the "pre-steps" to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NMS</z:e> and treat them as soon as possible for better prognosis </plain></SENT>
