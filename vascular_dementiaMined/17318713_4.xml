<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study the appearance of ChP in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 57 AD and 21 VD patients and in 47 controls (CG) as well as the influence of ChP on the levels of tau protein and Abeta42 were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of ChP occurrence in the AD patient group (43.9%) was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) than in the control group (10.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the case of VD patients, 9.5% of this group was positive for ChP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of ChP DNA in the CSF of patients with AD significantly increases the occurrence of this disease (odds ratio = 7.21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42 levels were significantly lower in patients with AD than in the CG (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal tau protein was significantly higher in AD vs. CG (p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, no relationships between the presence of the bacterium in CSF and the level of either tau or Abeta42 protein were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we may suspect that testing for the presence of ChP in CSF, along with the tau and Abeta42 markers, may be used in the clinic diagnosis of AD </plain></SENT>
