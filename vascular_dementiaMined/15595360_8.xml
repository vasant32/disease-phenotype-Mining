<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight VaD patients completed three tests of executive functions and underwent MRI scanning to generate quantitative ratings of subcortical neuropathology at a baseline evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The caregiver-rated Lawton and Brody Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire was used to estimate instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) at the baseline evaluation and at a 1 year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that: (a) IADLs would decline significantly over the course of 1 year, and (b) baseline performance on executive tasks and subcortical neuropathology would predict IADL impairment at 1 year follow-up, even after accounting for global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A paired samples t-test demonstrated that IADLs declined significantly over the course of 1 year, and regression analyses revealed that baseline performance on executive tasks was a significant predictor of IADLs at the 1 year follow-up, even after accounting for global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Contrary to our expectation, subcortical neuropathology did not explain unique variance in IADLs after accounting for executive dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that baseline executive dysfunction is a significant and powerful predictor of future functional decline in individuals with VaD </plain></SENT>
