<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e>, Fourth Edition TR (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> IV TR) was used to diagnose for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in Trinidad </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Healthy seniors greater than 60 years old were controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants were administered the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and had blood analyzed for levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (tHcy) and microglial antibodies (MgAb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma tHcy was determined on the Abbot AxSym, serum CRP concentrations were measured using the Tina-Quant sCRP (Latex) high sensitive immunoturbidimetric assay and serum MgAb were examined on frozen rat brain sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study was carried out on 29 patients that fulfilled the inclusion criteria and 46 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the patients 65.5% had AD and 34.5% had VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were found between the mean MMSE scores of the different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MgAb presence as well as tHcy were able to distinguish between controls and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the AD and VaD type, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The MMSE is a good discriminative tool for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serum MgAbs are a possible biomarker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> pathology and tHcy is elevated in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
