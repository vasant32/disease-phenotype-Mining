<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present studies compared homocysteinemia in patients with AD and with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD),as well as in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Homocysteinemia was measured in 137 probable AD patients,diagnosed by the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, in 40 probably VD patients diagnosed by the NINDS-AIREN criteria, and in 42 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Homocysteine</z:chebi> levels were significantly higher in AD and VD groups, than in controls, however, VD patients were significantly older than the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of females was higher in the AD group, while serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi> vitamin levels tended to be lower in both the AD and VD groups, compared to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In order to adjust the results for these potentially interfering factors, a multivariate ANCOVA calculation was performed, where <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels were analyzed considering 2 grouping factors (gender and neurological type) and 4 covariates (age, albumin,serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This analysis confirmed that even after adjusting for the covariates, the difference between AD and VD groups and controls remain highly significant,while neither the gender itself, nor the interaction of gender and the neurological type had any significant influence on the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main finding, therefore, is a significant increase of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels in the 2 disease groups, compared to controls </plain></SENT>
