<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: New research criteria for subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (SVaD) have been suggested to define a more homogeneous subgroup of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal (Hc) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> is a hallmark of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), but it also occurs in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> disorders including vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>So far, it is unknown to which extent Hc <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> is present in SVaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From a larger consecutive referral population in a memory clinic, 11 patients fulfilling the research criteria for SVaD were carefully matched with comparison groups of healthy controls and patients with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To estimate the extent of Hc <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in SVaD, both Hc volumetry and visual rating of medial temporal lobe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (MTA) were applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In SVaD, significant Hc <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The extent was intermediate between controls and patients with AD both on Hc volumetry and visual MTA ratings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the same level of global cognition, Hc volumes were reduced by 11.6% in SVaD and 16.6% in AD, relative to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patient groups with AD and SVaD as identified by current research criteria appear to overlap considerably with regard to the feature of Hc <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While contamination with AD is a likely cause, other mechanisms of Hc <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in SVaD also deserve consideration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings have implications for the design of future clinical trials of SVaD </plain></SENT>
