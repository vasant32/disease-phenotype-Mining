<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This investigation showed that in I-AD patients with increased alpha 1-ACT and no concomitant elevation of other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase proteins, serum levels of alpha 1-ACT varied with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on our results, serum alpha 1-ACT does not appear to be a useful biomarker for clinical diagnosis of probable I-AD, but it might be associated with the clinical history of the disease </plain></SENT>
