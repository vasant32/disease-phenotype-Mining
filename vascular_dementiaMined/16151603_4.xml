<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although of different etiology, small vessel disease is postulated to be present in both conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated global cerebral blood flow (CBF), global cerebral circulation time (CCT) and global cerebral blood volume (CBV) in VD and AD patients using a multimodal ultrasound (US) approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>20 VD and 20 AD patients were included and compared with 12 age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Duplex US of both internal carotid and vertebral arteries was performed to measure CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CCT was defined as the time delay of an echo-contrast bolus arrival between the internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein using extracranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CBV was calculated as the product of CBF and CCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CBF was significantly lower (VD: 570 +/- 61; AD: 578 +/- 77; controls: 733 +/- 54 ml/min) and CCT significantly longer (8.8 +/- 2.6; 8.2 +/- 1.4; 6.4 +/- 0.8 s) in both patient groups compared with controls (p &lt; 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No difference in CBF and CCT was found between the two patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CBV was similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups (82 +/- 20; 79 +/- 19; 78 +/- 9 ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The equally reduced CBF and prolonged CCT in VD and AD support the hypothesis, that small vessel disease is a relevant factor in both types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The presented multimodal US approach helps to assess the extent of changes in the global cerebral hemodynamics in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> but does not allow a differentiation between VD and AD </plain></SENT>
