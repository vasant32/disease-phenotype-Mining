<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four computerized and three non-computerized memory tests, a naming test, and a test of visuo-motor speed were administered twice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two estimates of intellectual capacity were made, one at the first examination and the other 3 1/2 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One person in the AAMI group (n = 44) developed vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The group of AAMI subjects did less well on two of the seven memory tests after 3 1/2 years than they did initially; the control group (n = 18) had lower scores on one memory test at follow-up than they had previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that the memory capacity of subjects with AAMI is not pathologically impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The general intellectual level significantly influences whether an individual with memory complaints will be classified AAMI or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>People with high intelligence are less likely than people with lower intellectual capacity to fulfill the AAMI criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that AAMI lacks in construct validity </plain></SENT>
