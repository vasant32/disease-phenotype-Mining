<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We recently designed a mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e>, in which the cerebral white matter is damaged without significant gray matter lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The behavioral characteristics of these mice were studied using a test battery for neurological and cognitive functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult C57Bl/6 male mice were subjected to either sham-operation or bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (BCAS) using microcoils with an internal diameter of 0.18 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 30 days after BCAS, 70 animals were divided into 3 groups and subjected to behavioral test batteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first group underwent comprehensive behavioral test, including the neurological screen, prepulse inhibition, hot plate, open field, light/dark transition, Porsolt forced swim and contextual and cued fear conditioning (BCAS n=13; sham-operated n=11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second group was for the working memory task of the 8-arm radial maze test (BCAS n=12; sham-operated n=10), and the third for the reference memory task of the 8-arm radial maze test (BCAS n=13; sham-operated n=11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Another batch of animals were examined for histological changes (BCAS n=11; sham-operated n=12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The white matter including the corpus callosum was consistently found to be rarefied without clear ischemic lesions in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No apparent differences were observed in the comprehensive test batteries between the control and BCAS mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, in the working memory tasks tested with the 8-arm radial maze, the BCAS mice made significantly more errors than the control mice (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Again, there were no detectable differences in the reference memory tasks between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: At 30 days after BCAS, working <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> as well as white matter changes were apparent in the mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Working <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficit</z:e> was attributable to damage of the frontal-subcortical circuits, suggesting the BCAS model is useful to evaluate the substrates of subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
