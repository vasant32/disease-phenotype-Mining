<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since many of these lesions are probably caused by emboli, studying emboli-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> in rabbits should, hopefully, provide information that is useful when searching for a means of preventing and treating vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using magnetic resonance imaging we have found that N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30355">tert-butyl</z:chebi>-alpha-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-nitrone (a free radical scavenger) reduced the number of emboli-induced cerebral microinfarctions in the rabbit cortex but did not have any impact on the number of infarctions found in the subcortical structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that significant amount of free radicals are produced in the ischemic foci located in the cortex, but not in the ischemic foci located in the subcortical structures </plain></SENT>
