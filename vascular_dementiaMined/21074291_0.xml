<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebroventricular infusion of AÎ²1-40 enhances BK release, suggesting that the activity of this system may be elevated in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the profile of the activating protease of this system, plasma kallikrein (PK), in frontal and temporal brain tissue from postmortem confirmed cases of AD, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), and controls </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adjusted PK <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was significantly increased in the frontal cortex in AD, and the frontal and temporal cortex in VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar trends were seen for PK protein level in AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PK activity was significantly increased in the frontal and temporal cortex in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased PK activity in AD is likely to contribute to increased BK release and may thereby influence cerebral blood flow and vascular permeability </plain></SENT>
