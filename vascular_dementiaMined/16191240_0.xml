<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There are difficulties in accurately defining patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) and, therefore, little is known about the characteristics of this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the population characteristics in patients with VaD enrolled in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-week clinical trials of the efficacy and tolerability of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38462">acetylcholinesterase inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Enrolled patients had probable or possible VaD, classified according to NINDS-AIREN criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were excluded if they had a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> caused by other conditions not associated with the cardiovascular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1,219 patients, 73% with probable VaD and 27% with possible VaD, were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients had a mean Hachinski score of 9.7, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> the most prominent feature of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixty-eight percent of patients had a history of at least one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 28% of patients had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> before <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 99% of patients who had abnormal computer-assisted tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans, cortical and subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were among the lesions observed, with significant white-matter lesions also present in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventy-three percent of patients had experienced an abrupt <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of cognitive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vascular risk factors were prominent and included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (70%), smoking (62%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> (39%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The patients enrolled in these trials had probable or possible VaD; these patients exhibited a history of cerebrovascular disease and a broad range of comorbid cardiovascular conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The large number of patients enrolled will permit a thorough examination of the efficacy and tolerability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> in VaD </plain></SENT>
