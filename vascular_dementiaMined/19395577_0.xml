<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the neuroprotective action of this novel prescription, we examined the influence of GJ and FE on learning and memory using the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> and studied their affects on the central cholinergic system in the hippocampus with neuronal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was applied for 2 h, rats were administered GJ (200 mg kg(-1), p.o.) or FE (200 mg kg(-1), p.o.) daily for 2 weeks, followed by training and performance of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats with ischemic insults showed impaired learning and memory of the tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre-treatment with GJ and FE produced improvement in the escape latency to find the platform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre-treatments with GJ and FE also reduced the loss of cholinergic immunoreactivity in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that GJ and FE have a protective effect against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced neuronal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that GJ and FE might be useful in the treatment of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
