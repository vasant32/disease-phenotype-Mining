<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TLJN belongs to the ethnopharmacological family of medicines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the protective effect of TLJN on oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) induced-injury of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The model of OGD was established in the primarily cultured BMECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TLJN was added to the OGD-injured BMECs for 6h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A series of assays were used to detect the effects of TLJN on: (i) MIP-1β content in BMECs conditioned media (CM) by ELISA; (ii) MIP-1β protein expression in BMECs by western blotting and immunocytochemistry; (iii) the expression of CCR5, receptor of MIP-1β, in BMECs by western blotting; (iv) the proliferative activity of microglial cells via the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our results showed that the OGD-injured BMECs presented with large amounts of secretion and expression of MIP-1β and up-regulation of CCR5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, the CM of OGD-injured BMECs remarkably increased the proliferative activity of microglial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The TLJN-treated BMECs exhibited a reduction of MIP-1β content in BMECs-CM and a down-regulation of MIP-1β and CCR5 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, an inhibitory effect of CM of OGD-injured plus TLJN injection-treated BMECs on microglial proliferation was also found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TLJN reduced the expression of MIP-1β and CCR5 in OGD-injured BMECs, and the CM of OGD-injured plus TLJN injection-treated BMECs inhibited the proliferative activity of microglial cells, suggesting the therapeutic potential of TLJN on ischemic cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
