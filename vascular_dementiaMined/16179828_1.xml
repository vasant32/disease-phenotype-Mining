<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we describe the macroscopic and microscopic neuropathological findings of 5 patients with severe CAA-associated secondary vascular changes, including smooth muscle cell degeneration, hyalinization, 'double-barreling' phenomenon, macrophage infiltration, and aneurysmal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the vessel wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 3 of the 5 patients these vascular changes were associated with multiple small <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp>, whereas in 2 patients areas of ischemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, none of these patients suffered from large (lobar) hemorrhagic accidents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, severe CAA, particularly when associated with secondary vascular pathology, may lead to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-like ischemic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hence, the distinction between patients with severe CAA and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> from those suffering from vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> can be difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We speculate that CAA, particularly when associated with secondary vascular pathology, although not resulting in large <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp>, may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The functional impact of CAA and CAA-related secondary vascular changes on cognitive performance warrants further exploration </plain></SENT>
