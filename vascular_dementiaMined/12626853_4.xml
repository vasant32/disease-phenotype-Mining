<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to examine the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of TNF-alpha, a proinflammatory cytokine mediating myelin damage, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intrathecal TNF-alpha levels were related to the clinical symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, as well as to intrathecal levels of sulfatide, a marker of white matter degradation, and of neurofilament, a marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CSF levels of TNF-a, sulfatide and neurofilament were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> analyzed by immunoenzymatic procedures in 17 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> and in 26 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The intrathecal concentration of TNF-alpha was significantly increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> patients compared to healthy controls (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The intrathecal levels of TNF-alpha were significantly correlated (r = 0.6, p = 0.02) to the levels of sulfatide, but not to the levels of neurofilament, (r = 0.08, NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated intrathecal production of TNF-alpha in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The correlation between TNF-a and sulfatide levels in the CSF suggests that this <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing cytokine leads to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of oligodendrocytes, thereby contributing to white matter degeneration, a hallmark of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
