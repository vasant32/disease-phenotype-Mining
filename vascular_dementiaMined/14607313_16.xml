<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The changes in rCBF were compared with the results of the medical examination and neuropsychological tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sample consisted of 41 patients with the Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of ChE-I (rivastigmine) treatment was studied on 33 patients, while the nontreated control group consisted of 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the treated patients, an increase in the rCBF was observed, while the scores of the neuropsychological tests decreased slightly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the VaD group, the increase in rCBF was more significant in the frontal regions, whereas in the group with AD in the temporal regions, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the nontreated patients, a decrease of both rCBF and scores of neuropsychological tests were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The scores of the neuropsychological tests correlated with the results of rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased levels of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> in the brain after ChE-I treatment may support the cholinergic regulation of rCBF, and in result increase it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such effects seem to be more pronounced in the more affected brain regions </plain></SENT>
