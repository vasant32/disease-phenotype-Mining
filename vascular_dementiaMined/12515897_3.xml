<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To understand the distribution and the specificity of astrocyte pathology in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> we quantified reactive and degenerating astrocytes in different regions of the deep and subcortical white matter and of the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sections of frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes of 12 histologically proven cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> were immunostained with antibodies to glial fibrillary protein (GFAP) and to metallothionein I and II (MT-I-II), markers which specifically identify <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and reactive astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control tissues were from 6 elderly patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The brains of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> were characterized by few and lightly immunostained astrocytes in the deep white matter, but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and reactive astrocytes, strongly immunoreactive for GFAP and MT-I-II, were prominent in the subcortical white matter and the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the relative distribution of GFAP positive and MT-I-II positive astrocytes was significantly different between the cerebral cortex and the subcortical white matter, the MT-I-II positive astrocytes being more frequent in the cerebral cortex, and the GFAP positive astrocytes in the subcortical white matter (p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The GFAP and MT-I-II expressions in subsets of reactive astrocytes in the cortico-subcortical layers together with regressive astroglial changes in the deep white matter suggest that the dynamic plasticity of astroglia is topographically and biochemically differentiated in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger</z:e> type </plain></SENT>
