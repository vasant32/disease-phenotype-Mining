<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is still unclear if a relationship exists between the APOE epsilon4 allele and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) in elderly subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence of APOE alleles in elderly patients with VaD compared to AD patients and to control subjects with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (NoCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated 396 consecutive patients aged &gt; or =65 years with definite or suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> with a clinical (Mini-Mental State Examination, Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating, Geriatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale), functional (Activities of Daily Living, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living), comorbidity (Cumulative Illness Rating Scale) and instrumental (CT scan, NMR) assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was made according to NINCDS-ADRDA and NINDS-AIREN Work Group and the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>APOE genotypes were analyzed by a recently described method resulting in positive/negative chain reaction products for each APOE genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was carried out using the Pearson chi(2), the Kruskal-Wallis test and the ANOVA post hoc comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 287 elderly patients (males = 138, females = 149, mean age = 77.8 +/- 6.9 years, range = 65-98) with diagnoses of VaD (n = 97), AD (n = 82) or NoCI (n = 108) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher APOE epsilon4 allele frequency was observed in AD patients compared to VaD and/or NoCI subjects, while no differences were found between VaD patients and subjects with NoCI (AD = 24.3%, VaD = 10.3, NoCI = 8.7, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a significantly lower APOE epsilon3 allele frequency was observed in AD patients compared to VaD and/or NoCI subjects but not between VaD and NoCI patients (AD = 71.3%, VaD = 80.9, NoCI = 83.4, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed in the APOE epsilon2 allele (VaD = 8.8%, AD = 4.4, NoCI = 7.9, p = n.s.) among the 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this population, the frequency of the APOE epsilon4 allele is lower in VaD than in AD </plain></SENT>
