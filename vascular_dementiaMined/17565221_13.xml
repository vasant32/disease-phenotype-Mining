<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to explore cerebral hemodynamics by transcranial Doppler in VaD and AD, compared with age-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transcranial Doppler was investigated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in the basal condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral vasoreactivity to hyper- and <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> was evaluated with <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> mixture inhalation followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We studied 60 AD and 58 VaD patients and 62 nondemented controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both AD and VaD subjects showed lower flow velocities (FV) and higher pulsatility indices (PI) as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lower total vasomotor reactivity and lower response to <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> were observed in the AD and VaD groups as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AD and VaD patients did not show significant differences in FV, PI values or cerebral vasoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reduced FV and increased PI with a significant vasoreactivity reduction in VaD and AD patients are indicators of impairment of cerebral microvasculature circulation in both diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The identification of vascular function impairment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> kinds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> could be of help in identifying patients who would thus benefit more from specific therapeutic approaches </plain></SENT>
