<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate insight in a group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients with two assessment scales and to assess their relationship with the cognitive level of disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-nine consecutive patients affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (n = 37) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n = 32) with a wide range of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MMSE = 17.0 +/- 6.4) were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insight was evaluated with the Guidelines for the Rating of Awareness Deficits (GRAD)--specifically targeted to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e>--and the Clinical Insight Rating scale (CIR), evaluating a broader spectrum of insight (reason for the visit, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo>, functional deficits, and perception of the progression of the disease) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the whole sample, GRAD and CIR were significantly associated with MMSE (Spearman's coefficient = .51, p &lt; .001; and r = -.55, p &lt; .001) and with Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating scale (-.57, p &lt; .001; and r = .57, p &lt; .001) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The shape of the relationship of MMSE with CIR and GRAD scales was assessed with spline smoothers suggesting that the relationship follows a trilinear pattern and is similar for both scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insight was uniformly high for MMSE scores &gt; or = 24, showed a linear decrease between MMSE scores of 23 and 13, and was uniformly low for MMSE scores &lt; or = 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The trilinear model of the association between insight and cognitive status reflects more closely the observable decline of insight and can provide estimates of when the decline of insight begins and ends </plain></SENT>
