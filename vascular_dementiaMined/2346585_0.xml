<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Emphasis is placed on reviewing the neuropsychological literature related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, a retrospective analysis was carried out among four groups of subjects (N = 61) who were divided according to the presence or absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white-matter alterations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A main effect for deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white-matter alterations</z:hpo> was found for almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measures of diastolic and systolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the two nondemented groups there was an effect of deep white matter alteration on neuropsychological functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects with deep white matter changes performed worse on tests of immediate and delayed recall of a prose passage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> groups there were no differences on any of the neuropsychological measures, although subjects with deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter alterations</z:hpo> exhibited a higher incidence of focal neurologic signs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> is probably more prevalent than currently appreciated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, among clinically nondemented individuals periventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white-matter alterations</z:hpo> may be associated with subtle but definable neuropsychological deficits, and these individuals may be at risk for developing a dementing illness </plain></SENT>
