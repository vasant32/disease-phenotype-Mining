<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data presented here are derived from a convenience sample of 296 participants recruited through senior citizen agencies in Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle was measured using the Health-promoting Lifestyle Profile (HPLP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven knowledge subscales were developed, consistent with the HPLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed using multiple regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlations among the lifestyle and knowledge indicated statistically significant results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the strength of these associations was generally weak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis found that six variables explained 20% of the variance in the lifestyle score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These included: knowledge of interpersonal relations, knowledge of physical activity, medical knowledge, medical history, self-assessment of general health, and use of alcohol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that knowledge, by itself, does not necessarily ensure that people engage in self-practising healthy lifestyle behaviors, and those who experience illness and, perhaps exposure to risk factors, had higher HPLP scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recommendations for how older people can be supported to reduce some of the attitudinal barriers that reduce healthy lifestyle behaviors are discussed </plain></SENT>
