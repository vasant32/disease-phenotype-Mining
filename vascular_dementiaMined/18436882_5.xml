<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) have an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The identification of predictors of conversion to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is therefore important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to test the hypothesis that subcortical hyperintensities (SH) are associated with an increased rate of conversion to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in MCI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was an observational study on consecutive MCI patients attending a memory clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed SH on a baseline MRI scan, using a semiquantitative rating scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A multivariable Cox regression model was used to test the association of SH with conversion to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We included 170 MCI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median duration of follow-up was 3.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During this period, 67 patients (39.4%, 95% CI: 32.1 to 46.8%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) in 29 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> in 19, mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in 8, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in 7, fronto-temporal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in 2, and primary progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SH were not associated with the risk to develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> as a whole, including AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the risk to develop vascular or mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> increased significantly with increasing amounts of SH at baseline (HR=1.14 [95% CI: 1.06 to 1.24]), especially periventricular hyperintensities (HR=2.71 [95% CI: 1.60 to 4.58]), independently of medial temporal lobe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, age, gender, vascular risk factors, education, and cognitive functions at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk of vascular or mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, but not of other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, was significantly increased in MCI patients with a large amount of subcortical hyperintensities at baseline </plain></SENT>
