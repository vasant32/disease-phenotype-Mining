<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This paper describes symptoms and findings in a 57-year-old painter who had been exposed to various organic solvents for over 30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He began to work as a painter at 16 years of age, frequently working in poorly ventilated areas; he used solvents to remove paint from the skin of his arms and hands at the end of each work shift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient and his family noticed impaired short-term memory function and changes in affect in his early forties, which progressed until after he stopped working and was thus no longer exposed to paints and solvents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the patient's exposures had ended, serial neuropsychological testing revealed persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> without evidence of further progression, and improvement in some domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging revealed global and symmetrical volume loss, involving more white than gray matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The findings in this patient are consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> and are differentiated from other dementing processes such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (vascular) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and alcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Previous descriptions in the literature of persistent neurobehavioral effects associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> exposure to organic solvents corroborate the findings in this case </plain></SENT>
