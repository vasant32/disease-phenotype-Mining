<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cerebral: cerebellar <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> uptake ratio (%) (CCR) was used as a measured of relative cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CCRs were about 85-90% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> areas in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moderate VDBT patients showed a remarkable decrease of CCRs in the basal grey region (thalamus and basal ganglia) (right 79%, left 77%) and in the frontal area (right 79%, left 80%) (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In severe VDBT patients a significant decrease of the CCR was noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The decrease of mean CCRs in the hemispheres was significantly correlated with the severity of disease determined by psychometric testing </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These differences in the perfusion patterns and their changes with progression of the illnesses may be reflected in characteristic clinical features </plain></SENT>
