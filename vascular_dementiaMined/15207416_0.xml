<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were required to be 65 years or older, to have <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV diagnoses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) or a combination of both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A brain computerized tomography (CT) was performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients; 60 demented patients,27 men (45 %) and 33 women (55 %) were selected for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The University of California Los Angeles neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) was administered at baseline, then after 4 and 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients had at least a score of 24 or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Hoehn and Yahr scale was used for evaluating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The scales were administered by an examinator who was not aware of the kind of treatment of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a wash-out period of 10 days,20 patients, 9 men and 11 women, mean age 76.6 +/- 6.0 years, were randomly assigned torisperidone 1 mg daily in divided doses (morning and bedtime) (Group A); 20 patients, 9 men and 11 women, mean age 82.5 +/- 9.3 years were randomly assigned to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7735">olanzapine</z:chebi> 5mg at bedtime (Group B), and 20 patients, 9 men and 11 women, mean age 77.6 +/- 4.6 years, were randomly assigned to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8459">promazine</z:chebi> 50 mg daily (morning and bedtime) (Group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In case of lack of clinical response, after 4 weeks, the dose could be increased to 2 mg/day of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi>, 10 mg/day of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7735">olanzapine</z:chebi>, and to 100 mg/day of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8459">promazine</z:chebi> in the respective groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Repeated measures ANOVA was used for the statistical analysis of rating scales over time (baseline, 4 and 8 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the end of the 8th week, a global improvement was obtained in 80% of patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7735">olanzapine</z:chebi>, vs. 65 % of patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8459">promazine</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> in doses of 1-2 mg/day and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7735">olanzapine</z:chebi> in doses of 5-10 mg/day are effective and safe in the treatment of BPSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">Risperidone</z:chebi> presents a major and dose-dependent antidopaminergic action and seems to be preferable when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000738'>hallucinations</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000746'>delusions</z:hpo> are prevailing symptoms, even if it gives good results on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> and wandering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7735">Olanzapine</z:chebi> seems to be faster in its sedative effect, probably for H1 receptor blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 5-HT6 antagonism may favor <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> release and this explains why these patients have not presented a cognitive worsening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, both drugs are comparable or even superior to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8459">promazine</z:chebi>, with significantly fewer side effects of both anticholinergic and extrapyramidal character </plain></SENT>
