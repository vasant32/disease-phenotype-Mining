<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Having obtained good results in a previous study comparing rivastigmine, an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholine-sterase (BuChE), vs. aspirin, we aimed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of rivastigmine vs. aspirin plus nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and probable VaD received rivastigmine 3-6 mg/day (n = 32) or aspirin plus nimodipine (n = 32) in an open study for 16 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with rivastigmine showed superior benefits, compared with those receiving aspirin plus nimodipine, in attention, executive function, instrumental activities of daily living, and behavioural and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033975,C0459435" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Finding" abbrv="">psychotic</z:e> disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Side-effects in both groups were tolerable and there were no study withdrawals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The benefits observed with rivastigmine may reflect its inhibitory effects on AChE and BuChE, and the drug's affinity for frontal brain areas </plain></SENT>
