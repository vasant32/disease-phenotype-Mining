<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study we present 2 postmenopausal women who showed clinical symptoms that resembled those of a rather well-defined group of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> disorders, termed <z:hpo ids='HP_0007123'>subcortical dementia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger disease</z:e>, CADASIL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patient 1 exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA (mtDNA) variants in the ND5 gene at position 13,708 and the Cytb gene at position 15,257 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These DNA variants have been described in a number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurologic disorders</z:e>, but their pathogenetic potential is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient 2 showed the same DNA alterations and an additional mtDNA variant at position 15,812 in the Cytb gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The principal neurohistologic features of the 2 atrophic brains presented here include: subtotal selective neuronal cell loss in the cortex and, to a lesser degree, in the basal ganglia (claustrum, putamen, globus pallidus), sparing palaeocortex and periarchaeocortex, and a very characteristic and diagnostic feature was detachment of astrocytic processes from capillary walls resulting in pericapillary space formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These pericapillary spaces were partially filled with macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The spaces were not associated with total breakdown of the blood vessel walls as demonstrated by the <z:mp ids='MP_0000215'>absence of erythrocytes</z:mp>, lymphocytes, or polymorphonuclear leukocytes outside the vascular bed of the brain; progressive subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo>, as it is seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0007123'>subcortical dementia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger</z:e>), but lacking arterial lipohyalinosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cerebral grey and white matter revealed cuffing of arteries and arterioles by adventitial macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The neocortical and subcortical changes were accompanied by myriads of activated macrophages filled with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pathology of our 2 cases differs from that of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> and we suggest the term of "disseminated neocortical and subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (DNSE) with widespread activation of brain macrophages" </plain></SENT>
