<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have developed a new procedure, including three affinity chromatography steps, micro-reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography (mR-HPLC) and Western blotting/mass spectrometric analysis to study central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) specific proteins in human cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) in order to find biochemical markers for neuronal and synaptic function and pathology in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0154671" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">degenerative brain disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After the three affinity chromatography steps, intended to remove interfering serum proteins from CSF, mR-HPLC revealed four major peaks, which by both Western blotting and mass spectrometric analyses were found to correspond to beta 2-microglobulin, cystatin C, transthyretin (TTR) and asialotransferrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When comparing these peaks in CSF from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) patients and age-matched healthy controls, a reduction of the brain-specific TTR was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore we quantified TTR in CSF and serum samples from 8 patients with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AD (EAD), 18 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> AD (LAD), 8 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VAD) and 18 healthy individuals using a nephelometric method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSF-TTR was divided into barrier-dependent and barrier-independent TTR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The barrier-independent i.e. brain-specific TTR was significantly reduced in the EAD group compared to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transthyretin has been found to be present in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>senile plaques</z:hpo> in AD, and to specifically bind to beta/A4 protein, the major component of the amyloid deposits in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the reduction of the transthyretin-isoform in CSF in AD may reflect an absorption of transthyretin to the amyloid deposits in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>senile plaques</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
