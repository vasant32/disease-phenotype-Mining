<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using quantitative electroencephalography we examined power in the 20- to 28-Hz band in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer's type (DAT), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly controls (CON) following an IV bolus of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> (0.5 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared to both CON and VaD subjects, DAT subjects showed a marked loss of beta power elicited across the cortex, with largest differences noted in the frontal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Losses were most significant for the peak response recorded at 30 to 90 s postinjection and persisted during the 5-minute follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that differences in this electrocerebral response reflect differences in the underlying neuropathology of DAT and VaD subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> challenge may be well suited for the in vivo assessment of brain function in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> characterized by prominent cortical pathology </plain></SENT>
