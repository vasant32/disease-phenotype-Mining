<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the participants received brain computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was confirmed by clinical criteria and the imaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only patients with probable AD, and subcortical and cortical VaD were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to evaluate global cognitive function, and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was used to assess neuropsychiatric symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 536 participants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 320 (59.7%) had AD, 161 (30%) had subcortical VaD, 35 (6.4%) had cortical VaD, and 16 (2.9%) had mixed cortical and subcortical VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cortical VaD patients had the highest mean composite NPI scores in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> domains and AD patients had the lowest composite scores in most domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean composite scores of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbance</z:hpo> domains in patients with cortical VaD were significantly higher than those in the patients with AD after controlling for years of education and MMSE score (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There were few differences among the patients with AD, subcortical VaD and cortical VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most consistent differences were the high <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbance</z:hpo> scores in those with cortical VaD </plain></SENT>
