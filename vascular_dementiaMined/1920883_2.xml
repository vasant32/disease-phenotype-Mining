<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer type and 24 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In healthy subjects, there was a significant positive linear correlation between P300 latency and age, with P300 latency increasing at the rate of 1.5 msec/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neither N100 nor P200 component was correlated with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The amplitudes of N100, P200 and P300 components in females were slightly larger than those in males, but the differences were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Not only P300 latencies but also P200 latencies were significantly different in healthy subjects, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer type and those with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 74.4% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer type and 62.5% of those with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, the P300 latency was over 2 SE above the age-estimated regression line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference of the P300 latency prolongation may have resulted from the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> but not from the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
