<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 6-month, multicentre, open-label, uncontrolled trial was undertaken in 75 AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eligible patients received an initial galantamine dose of 8 mg/day and escalated over 5-8 weeks to maintenance doses of 16 or 24 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary efficacy measures were AD Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) and the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change-Plus version (CIBIC-plus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Behavioural Pathology in AD Rating Scale (BEHAVE AD), the AD Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were the secondary efficacy variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analyses were based on the intent-to-treat population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with galantamine showed significant improvement in cognition on the ADAS-cog and CIBIC-plus at month 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Galantamine showed favourable effects on activities of daily living </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Behavioural symptoms and sleep quality were also significantly improved (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Galantamine was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The adverse events were mild-to-moderate intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most frequent adverse events commonly reported were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> (16.4%), dizziness (9.6%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (6.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results of this study may be consistent with galantamine being an effective and safe treatment for mild-to-moderate AD patients with or without cerebrovascular disease and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Flexible dose escalation of galantamine was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The daily maintenance dose of galantamine was 16 mg/day, followed by a back up dose of 24 mg/day </plain></SENT>
