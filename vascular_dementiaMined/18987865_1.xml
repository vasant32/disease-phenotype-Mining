<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously described two novel biomarkers of MVA based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), VRS <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and abnormalities in the transfer of systolic arterial pulsation to the ventricular CSF, which occur as a result of decreased cerebral arterial compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These are associated with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and treatment-resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied a group of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects at risk of cerebrovascular disease to determine if these biomarkers are present in patients who have no evidence of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied 31 subjects, 16 with three or more vascular risk factors and 15 with one or less significant risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We measured arterial blood flow and CSF flow in the cerebral aqueduct, white matter lesion load, and the distribution and number of VRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in CSF pulsatility and in VRS in the basal ganglia between the two groups, but no differences in white matter lesion load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that asymptomatic subjects at risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have MRI evidence of MVA before white matter lesions become apparent </plain></SENT>
