<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On MRI, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> is the primary hallmark of neurodegenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), while vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is characterized by the presence of ischemic vascular damage, such as territorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, lacunes, and white matter hyperintensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evidence is accumulating that vascular factors play an important role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> at old age and clinical AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present article we present results of four recent MRI studies suggesting the additional involvement of small vessel disease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>Atrophy</z:mpath> in the medial temporal lobe, as typically observed in AD, and small vessel disease often coincide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In terms of clinical significance, their effects may even be synergistic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The strict distinction between AD and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is often artificial, as most patients suffer from both disorders to some extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the future, we see an important role for MRI in identifying those different compartments, regardless of clinical classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment could be directed by (and evaluated through) MRI patterns, rather than a diagnostic label </plain></SENT>
