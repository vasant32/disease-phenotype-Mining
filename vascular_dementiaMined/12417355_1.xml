<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two important prerequisites for assessing therapeutic benefits in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) with cerebrovascular disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>), are the inclusion of appropriate patients and the use of relevant outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is substantial overlap in the clinical symptomatology, risk factors, imaging changes, pathophysiology and neurochemical mechanisms between VaD, AD and AD with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While validated and acceptable clinical criteria suitable for clinical trials have been developed for VaD, there is still debate as to how mixed cases (i.e. AD with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) are best conceptualized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As with AD, there is consensus that outcome measures in studies of patients with VaD, or AD with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, should include assessments of cognitive and global function, of ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL) and of behavioral symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other measures, e.g., caregiver burden, would be desirable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Care must be taken in extrapolating AD-specific evaluations to VaD, however, because different specific domains are affected and the disease course is different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In clinical trials, cognitive performance and global function decline steadily in patients with untreated AD compared with smaller changes in patients with untreated VaD, while behavior and ADL deteriorate over 6 months in patients with either untreated AD or untreated VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Such differences in untreated outcome need to be considered when interpreting trial results using outcome measures that were largely designed for studies of patients with AD </plain></SENT>
