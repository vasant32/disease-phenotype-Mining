<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Smoking is a risk factor for several life-threatening diseases, but its long-term association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is controversial and somewhat understudied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to investigate the long-term association of amount of smoking in middle age on the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD), and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) several decades later in a large, diverse population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed prospective data from a multiethnic population-based cohort of 21,123 members of a health care system who participated in a survey between 1978 and 1985 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, AD, and VaD made in internal medicine, neurology, and neuropsychology were collected from January 1, 1994, to July 31, 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate the association between midlife smoking and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, AD, and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 5367 people (25.4%) were diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (including 1136 cases of AD and 416 cases of VaD) during a mean follow-up period of 23 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results were adjusted for age, sex, education, race, marital status, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, body mass index, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and alcohol use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with nonsmokers, those smoking more than 2 packs a day had an elevated risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.14; 95% CI, 1.65-2.78), AD (adjusted HR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.63-4.03), and VaD (adjusted HR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.20-6.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort, heavy smoking in midlife was associated with a greater than 100% increase in risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, AD, and VaD more than 2 decades later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the brain is not immune to long-term consequences of heavy smoking </plain></SENT>
