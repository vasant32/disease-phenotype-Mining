<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Canadian Study of Health and Aging is a 10-year population study, from 1991 to 2001, of a representative sample of persons aged 65 years or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lifetime job history allowed application of complexity scores and classification of work-related physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analyses included 3,557 subjects, of whom 400 were incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases, including 299 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and 93 with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In fully adjusted Cox regression models, high complexity of work with people or things reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (hazard ratios were 0.66 (95% confidence interval: 0.44, 0.98) and 0.72 (95% confidence interval: 0.52, 0.99), respectively) but not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, hazard ratios were 0.36 (95% confidence interval: 0.15, 0.90) for high complexity of work with people and 0.50 (95% confidence interval: 0.25, 1.00) for high complexity of work with things </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses according to median duration (23 years) of principal occupation showed that associations with complexity varied according to duration of employment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High complexity of work appears to be associated with risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, but effects may vary according to subtype </plain></SENT>
