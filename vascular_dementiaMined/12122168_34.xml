<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The visual association test (VAT) is a brief learning task based on imagery mnemonics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The test materials consist of six line drawings of pairs of interacting objects or animals-for example, an ape holding an umbrella </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The person is asked to name each object and, later, is presented with one object from the pair and asked to name the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To verify that the task induces robust incidental or effortless learning (study 1), and to study the efficiency of the test as a discriminator between early <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer type (DAT) and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> people (study 2) and non-DAT types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (study 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Study 1: two groups of elderly volunteers were administered the VAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The stimuli were presented in the interactive fashion to group A-for example, a monkey carrying an umbrella (n=83)-and side by side to group B-for example, separate pictures of a monkey alone and an umbrella alone (n=79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group B received learning instructions, but group A did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Study 2: three groups of subjects were selected from a population based follow up study: incident DAT cases (n=24), cognitively declining subjects not diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n=21), and stable non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> subjects (n=204) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Test performance of the non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> group at baseline was compared with that of patients with DAT at the time of their diagnosis, of patients with DAT a year before their diagnosis, and of non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> declining subjects at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Study 3: subjects were patients referred for neuropsychological assessment because of suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They were diagnosed by consensus criteria of various <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Study 1: recall was more than twice as high in group A as in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus interactive presentation, even in the absence of learning instructions, enhances learning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Study 2: at a level of 97.5% specificity, the VAT had a sensitivity of 87.5% for DAT cases at the time of diagnosis and 66.7% one year before diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The cognitively declining group scored significantly lower on the VAT at baseline than the non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The VAT discriminated more effectively than both the MMSE and the six item picture learning task from the CAMCOG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Study 3: VAT scores were significantly lower in patients with DAT (n=48) than in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n=37), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (n=9), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0007123'>subcortical dementia</z:hpo> (n=15), but not lower than in patients with Lewy body <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n=7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Mean mini mental state examination scores of these groups were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The VAT discriminated patients with DAT from patients with other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> more effectively than a prose recall test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity was 79% and specificity 69% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The VAT detects with high specificity a sizeable proportion of patients with DAT a year before the diagnosis, and a low VAT score is relatively uncommon in patients with non-DAT <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
