<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a 2-year follow-up study of elderly people from six communities in Chongqing, China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was detected using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationship between alcohol consumption and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was investigated using multiple logistic regression models, adjusting for the potential confounders age, sex, educational level and cigarette smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Light-to-moderate drinking was associated with a significantly lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> compared with non-drinking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001426'>Excessive drinking</z:mp> was related to a higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of light-to-moderate drinking seemed most prominent among vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 0.63 (0.55-0.72) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 0.31 (0.19-0.51) for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 0.45 (0.12-1.69) for other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a model adjusting for confounding variables, a light-to-moderate intake of beer was associated with a significantly higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> than a non-drinker of beer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For wine, a significantly lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> existed for a light-to-moderate drinker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Light-to-moderate drinking was associated with a significantly lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> compared with a non-drinker </plain></SENT>
