<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AD is neuropathologically confirmed for more than 80% of cases at major referral centers (primarily Caucasians); however, information on diagnostic accuracy in population-based studies and studies of different ethnic groups is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: There were 3,734 men who participated in the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study 1991 through 1993 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> examination and 2,603 in the 1994 through 1996 examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses were based on published criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuropathologists blinded to clinical data quantified <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo> (NFT) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>neuritic plaques</z:hpo> (NP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 220 autopsied subjects, clinical evaluation revealed 68 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognition, 73 intermediate, and 79 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>: 20 AD, 27 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 19 AD + other, and 13 other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 20 cases with pure AD, the median value for maximum neocortical NFT density was 6.9/mm(2) and for neocortical NP density was 8.0/mm2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Corresponding densities for other groups were &lt;3.0/mm2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using established neuropathologic criteria, 25% (5/20) of clinical AD cases had enough NP to meet definite AD criteria, whereas 65% (13/20) had sufficient NP to meet neuropathologic definite or probable AD criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among nine AD cases with moderately severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, only two (22%) had NP densities great enough to meet definite neuropathologic criteria, whereas seven (78%) met neuropathologic criteria for probable AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neuropathologic confirmation and NP density among decedents with clinical AD in this population-based study were lower than reported by referral centers and similar to reports from two other community studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ethnic differences in propensity for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath> as well as differences in clinical severity and representativeness of cases might contribute to these findings </plain></SENT>
