<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Separate analyses were performed for diagnostic subgroups (probable or possible AD; VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 333 patients were diagnosed with AD and 71 with VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EGb 761® treatment was superior to placebo with respect to the SKT total score (drug-placebo differences: 1.7 for AD, p&lt;0.001, and 1.4 for VaD, p&lt;0.05) and the NPI total score (drug-placebo differences: 3.1 for AD, p&lt;0.001 and 3.2 for VaD, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant drug-placebo differences were found for most secondary outcome variables with no major differences between AD and VaD subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rates of adverse events in EGb 761® and placebo groups were essentially similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EGb 761® improved cognitive functioning, neuropsychiatric symptoms and functional abilities in both types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
