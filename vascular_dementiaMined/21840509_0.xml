<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are a manifestation of cerebral small vessel disease, which is associated with the progression of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent research has been focused on identifying biomarkers which may have a correlation with WML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previous population based studies have indicated a relation between the serum level of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase protein, C-reactive protein (CRP), and WML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However no previous studies have demonstrated its expression and relation to WML in brain tissue itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we use the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> of permanent bilateral common carotid artery ligation (BCCAL) to assess CRP expression during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> (CCH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results show that CRP is up-regulated at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels in brain tissue from BCCAL animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of CRP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was upregulated on day 3 following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because previous studies, as well as the present study, have shown that microglial activity is prominent after the third day of CCH, we sought to determine the role of microglia in CRP expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results indicate that cultured microglia express <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein for CRP and this expression is increased when cells are treated with interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) or a combination of the two. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This finding could indicate a possible role for CRP in the progression of small vessel disease in the brain and provide a therapeutic target </plain></SENT>
