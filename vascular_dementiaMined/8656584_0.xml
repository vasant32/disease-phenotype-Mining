<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CBF at rest decreased significantly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions in the DAT and VD groups compared to the control groups (healthy aged persons, group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The value of mean CBF also decreased significantly in the DAT (40.1 micromilligrams/100 g/min) and VD groups (41.3) as compared to group C (51.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the DAT groups, the CBF was significantly lower in the parietal region compared to VD groups, and CBF and Hasegawa's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> score showed a positive correlation in the temporal and parietal regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Decreases in blood pressure upon standing were about 10 mmHg in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups, but the decrease rate in mean CBF was significantly greater in the VD groups (20.2%) than in the C (5.0%) and DAT groups (4.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dysautoregulation index (D.I. delta; % CBF mmHg), used as a measurement of cerebral autoregulation, was significantly higher in the VD groups (1.7) than in the C(0.5) and DAT groups (0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This index made it possible to make differential diagnosis in some patients in whom it was impossible using CBF at rest, probably due to impaired cerebral autoregulation and atherosclerotic changes in VD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that D.I. provides information on the condition of patients that cannot be obtained with CBF at rest and assists in differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
