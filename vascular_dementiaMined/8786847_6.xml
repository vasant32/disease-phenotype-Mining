<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our study examined the APOE polymorphism in a sample of 149 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients, of which there were 80 with probable <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> AD, 16 with a mixed form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MD), and 53 with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An elderly control sample was composed of 126 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data obtained on the whole AD sample did not confirm the association already reported with APOE epsilon 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A difference did emerge when the subjects were subdivided on the basis of age at the examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AD patients aged &lt; or = 80 years significantly differed from the correspondent elderly controls, while no difference was observed between the patients aged 81 years or older and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This pattern could be due to a previous disadvantageous effect of the epsilon 4 allele on the subjects bearing it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A substantially similar pattern was observed in the few MD patients, while no differences were found in the two VD subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio (OR) for AD associated with at least one epsilon 4 allele was significant and equal to 3.3 (95% CI = 1.2-9.1) for the &lt; or = 80 age class, while it was not significant and equal to 1.1 (95% CI = 0.4-2.8) for the &gt; 80 age class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that in AD patients aged less than 81 years, epsilon 4 is clearly associated with AD and that it can be considered a risk factor for AD chiefly before this age </plain></SENT>
