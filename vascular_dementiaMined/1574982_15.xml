<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sulfatide concentration in the VAD group (307 +/- 118 nmol/l) was significantly (p less than 0.0001) higher than that in controls (145 +/- 86 nmol/l) and the AD group (178 +/- 79 nmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the VAD patients, 8/20 had a significantly increased concentration of sulfatide (greater than mean + 2 S.D.), as compared with controls, while only 2/43 of the AD patients had a sulfatide concentration above this level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the elevated concentration of sulfatide in CSF from VAD patients reflects <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, sulfatide determinations, when combined with clinical findings, may be of diagnostic value, for discriminating between VAD and AD </plain></SENT>
