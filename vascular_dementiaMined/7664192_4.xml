<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the premorbid biographies of 21 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> for possible common features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven age-matched patients suffering from vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> served as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The observations from our qualitative study indicate that persons with a conflict-avoiding, submissive, premorbid personality predominate among Alzheimer patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Persons who later became Alzheimer patients tended to leave important daily-life decisions to their partners (or other persons of reference) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prior to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the very first neuropsychological deficits, persons who later became Alzheimer patients were found to stay in a lasting situation in which they were subject to a treatment that could be designated as "caring tutelage." Subsequently, most patients became subject to an increasingly patronizing and restricting treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further elements that were frequently found as part of the premorbid development were physical or psychological burden, loss of social contacts, and loss of motivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, assertive and dominant premorbid traits predominated in the group of vascular patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The premorbid biographical situation of persons who later became vascular patients was characterized by a loss of the control which these persons had hitherto exerted over partners, their families, or the situation at their working place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We advance the hypothesis that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> the described psychological phenomena are part of a preclinical process, during which biological, psychological, and social factors interact, finally joining into the clinical stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Possibilities for psychotherapeutic interventions are discussed </plain></SENT>
