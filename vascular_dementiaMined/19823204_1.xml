<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are often unable to describe their pain because of memory deficiency and speech problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may lead to under-diagnosing and suboptimal pain treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The article summarises a thesis on development and testing of a new instrument for pain assessment: Mobilisation-Observation-Behavior-Intensity-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> (MOBID-2) pain scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: 284 nursing home patients (with and without pain), who had been diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of different types in various stages, were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Behaviour and intensity of pain was assessed during video-uptakes of clinical examinations and during regular morning care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Psychometric property testing included assessments of reliability, validity and clinical usefulness for the nursing home staff </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Observation of pain behaviour during standardised and guided movements, by using the MOBID-2 Pain Scale, provides reliable and valid estimation of intensity of pain associated with the musculoskeletal-system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pain that is not associated with the musculoskeletal-system is frequently observed, but more challenging to assess </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients who have severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and/or a combination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, have a higher risk of suffering from severe and untreated pain than patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: The MOBID-2 pain scale may help to ensure competent pain treatment, and should be available in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Norwegian nursing homes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A multidisciplinary approach is needed for its implementation and use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Physicians in nursing homes should reconsider the staff's observations, perform additional investigations and find the balance between effects and side effects of pain treatment </plain></SENT>
