<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate caregiver burden associated with the individual BPSD in elderly people living in the community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects were 67 participants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> living with their caregivers (diagnosed in the third Nakayama study): 51 Alzheimer's disease, 5 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 11 other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and NPI Caregiver Distress Scale (NPI-D) were used to assess subjects' BPSD and related caregiver distress, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the subjects exhibiting BPSD, aberrant motor behavior had the highest mean NPI score, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233477" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">dysphoria</z:e> had the lowest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>Agitation</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> had the highest mean NPI-D score, and euphoria/elation had the lowest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011253" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Delusion</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo>/indifference, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo>/lability and aberrant motor behavior showed a correlation between the NPI and NPI-D scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The burden associated with BPSD is different for each symptom and does not always depend on frequency and severity of BPSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that some symptoms, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo>/lability, may affect the caregivers significantly, although their frequency and severity are low </plain></SENT>
