<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> continued to increase in the very old, and to define the types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and their relative proportions in this age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We collected data as part of the Canadian Study of Health and Aging (1990 to 1992), which consisted of a sample of 1,835 subjects from a population of 283,510 Canadians who were 85 years of age and older residing in the community or in institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the 85 years and older group was 28.5%, more than twice that of the 75- to 84-years cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of 23% in the 85- to 89-years sample (n = 1,332) increased to 40% in the 90 to 94 years group (n = 371) and, in the 95 years and older sample (n = 104), reached 58% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD; probable or possible) accounted for 75% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>; a vascular etiology alone accounted for 13% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of clinically diagnosed AD cases to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases increased significantly after age 65 and was higher in the 85+ group than in a younger cohort (65 to 84 years) </plain></SENT>
