<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to assess the long-term association between clustered metabolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> measured at middle age and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in old age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This prospective cohort study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> was started in 1965 and was extended to a study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in 1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjects were Japanese-American men with an average age of 52.7+/-4.7 (mean+/-SD) years at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 215 men, according to international criteria, and was based on a clinical examination, neuropsychological testing, and an informant interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The z scores were calculated for 7 risk factors (random postload <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, diastolic and systolic blood pressures, body mass index, subscapular skinfold thickness, random <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and total cholesterol) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The z-score sum was higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> subjects than in nondemented subjects, indicating a higher risk factor burden (0.74 versus -0.06, respectively; P=0 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Per SD increase in the z-score sum, the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was increased by 5% (RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.09) </plain></SENT>
