<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate if depressive symptoms in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients are associated with white matter changes (WMCs) in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: WMCs are frequently found in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, as well as among elderly nondemented patients with depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is less established whether or not WMCs are related to depressive symptoms in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 67 (26 men, 41 women) patients with primary degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo>), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), or mixed Alzheimer/VaD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were young-old (mean 68.1, SD 7.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent a standardized examination procedure and MRI of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The degree of WMCs was visually rated, blindly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Depressive symptoms were rated according to the Gottfries-Br√•ne-Steen scale (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, fear-panic, depressed mood) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant relationship was found between WMCs and depressive symptoms in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The possible involvement of WMCs in the pathogenesis of depressive symptoms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A link between disruptions of frontal-subcortical pathways, due to WMCs, and depressive symptomatology in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> has been hypothesised from earlier findings, which would imply common elements of pathogenesis for depressive symptomatology and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the results of the present study do not add further support to this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
