<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The dysfunction of this system is expressed in many diseases like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Lewy body, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In recent animal studies, it was found that selective cholinergic modulation affects visuospatial processes even more than memory function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In the current study, we tried to replicate those findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38323">cholinergic drugs</z:chebi> on memory and visuospatial functions, a selective anticholinergic drug, biperiden, was compared to a selective acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting drug, rivastigmine, in healthy elderly subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, cross-over study was performed in 16 healthy, elderly volunteers (eight men, eight women; mean age 66.1, SD 4.46 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects received biperiden (2 mg), rivastigmine (3 mg) and placebo with an interval of 7 days between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Testing took place 1 h after drug intake (which was around Tmax for both drugs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subjects were presented with tests for episodic memory (wordlist and picture memory), working memory tasks (N-back, symbol recall) and motor learning (maze task, pursuit rotor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Visuospatial abilities were assessed by tests with high visual scanning components (tangled lines and Symbol Digit Substitution Test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Episodic memory was impaired by biperiden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Rivastigmine impaired recognition parts of the episodic memory performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Working memory was non-significantly impaired by biperiden and not affected by rivastigmine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Motor learning as well as visuospatial processes were impaired by biperiden and improved by rivastigmine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results implicate <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> as a modulator not only of memory but also of visuospatial abilities </plain></SENT>
