<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The clinical characteristics and the pathological lesions of so-called vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> (VP) are still debatable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to define the core signs and symptoms and assess the cerebrovascular lesions in pathologically confirmed VP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the present study, VP was defined as the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> and pathological evidence of cerebrovascular lesions but no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162835" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">depigmentation</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> at the substantia nigra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the clinical signs and symptoms of 24 VP patients with those of 30 age-matched patients with pathologically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared the brain pathology in VP patients with that in 22 age-matched patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> (BD) who had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> according to clinical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VP was characterized clinically by a short-stepped or frozen gait, lead-pipe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo>, absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002322'>resting tremor</z:hpo>, and negative response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15765">levodopa</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Half or more of VP patients demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0007256'>pyramidal tract signs</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007024'>pseudobulbar palsies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the extent of vascular lesions at the basal ganglia between patients with VP and with BD without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The extent of frontal white matter <z:hpo ids='HP_0000980'>pallor</z:hpo> tended to be less broad in VP than in BD without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In VP patients, the number of oligodendrocytes in the frontal white matter was significantly less than that in age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects and significantly more than in those with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The core signs and symptoms of autopsy-proved VP differ from those of typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e>, and most VP patients had diffuse cerebral white matter lesions as well as basal ganglia lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>VP might be related to frontal white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
