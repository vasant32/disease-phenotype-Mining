<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Vascular disease</z:e> was once considered the principal cause of aging-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More recently, however, research emphasis has shifted to studies of progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative disease</z:hpo> processes, such as those giving rise to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>neuritic plaques</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although these studies have led to critical insights and potential therapeutic strategies, interest in the role of systemic and cerebrovascular disease mechanisms waned and has received relatively less attention and research support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> mechanisms play an important role in the risk for aging-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Vascular disease</z:e> frequently coexists with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in aging individuals, shares many risk factors with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> considered to be of the "Alzheimer type," and is observed more frequently than expected in postmortem material from individuals manifesting "specific" disease stigmata, such as abundant plaques and tangles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Considerable difficulties have emerged in attempting to classify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> as being related to vascular versus neurodegenerative causes, and several systems of criteria have been used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite multiple attempts, a lack of consensus remains regarding the optimal means of incorporating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> into clinical diagnostic, neurocognitive, or neuropathologic classification schemes for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We propose here an integrative, rather than a strictly taxonomic, approach to the study and elucidation of how <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> mechanisms contribute to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We argue that, instead of discriminating between, for example, "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>," "vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>," and other diseases, there is a greater need to focus clinical and research efforts on elucidating specific pathophysiologic mechanisms that contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> phenotypes and neuropathologic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We outline a multitiered strategy, beginning with clinical and public health interventions that can be implemented immediately, enhancements to ongoing longitudinal studies to increase their informative value, and new initiatives to capitalize on recent advances in systems biology and network medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This strategy will require funding from multiple public and private sources to support collaborative and interdisciplinary research efforts to take full advantage of these opportunities and realize their societal benefits </plain></SENT>
