<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) has occasionally been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> (CAA), but the prevalence and significance of this counterintuitive relationship are poorly known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the presence and characteristics of CAA in brains of VaD cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined temporal and parietal regions of the cerebral cortex of 26 consecutive VaD cases from the Lund Longitudinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We carried out immunohistochemistry and routine stainings, determined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">Apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (ApoE) genotypes, and obtained clinical characteristics on the studied group for retrospective analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CAA was marked in eight out of 26 cases, and correlated strongly with the presence of cortical microinfarcts, both in the temporal lobe and in the parietal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on comparisons with eight age-matched VaD cases without CAA, the clinical records suggested that VaD cases with CAA as a group exhibited less pronounced neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A clear contribution of the ApoE genotype could not be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on a combination of the clinical and pathological data, we suggest that microinfarcts in the cerebral cortex associated with severe CAA may be the primary pathological substrate in a significant proportion of VaD cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Future studies should be undertaken to confirm or dismiss the hypothesis that these cases exhibit a different symptom profile than VaD cases without CAA </plain></SENT>
