<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Disturbances of emotional processing are a supportive feature for the diagnosis of subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We address here whether these disturbances might be useful as an early disease marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In order to examine the modulation of visual attention by emotionally arousing stimuli of different valence, 12 elderly patients with early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>, 12 age-comparable healthy adults and 12 young healthy subjects were studied while looking at pairs of pictures from the International Affective Picture Battery that were either neutral-neutral, neutral-positive or neutral-negative in terms of emotional content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eye movements were recorded with an infrared eye-tracking system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The direction of the first saccade and the dwell time during the 10 s of presentation were measured and compared among groups with parametric tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects showed a modulation of initial attentional orienting as well as a higher percentage of dwell time towards the pictures containing emotional material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> and old controls did not differ in either experimental measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Young patients showed a stronger bias towards emotionally negative material than both groups of older individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Modulation of visuospatial attention is preserved in early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This might have implications for therapeutic interventional approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A weakened sustained attention towards negative but not positive emotional pictures in the elderly is in accordance with the socioemotional selectivity theory, describing a relative selection of positive stimuli with aging </plain></SENT>
