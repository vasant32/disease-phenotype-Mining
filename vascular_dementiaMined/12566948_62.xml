<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe a methodology to evaluate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and frequency of different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and prevalence of the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The CHS is a longitudinal study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> among community-dwelling individuals over the age of 65 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 5,888 participants in the original study, 3,608 had a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain in 1991, and formed the cohort for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CHS included yearly measures of cognitive function and, from 1998 to 2000, participants were evaluated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> by detailed neurological, and neuropsychological examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The possible cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) were adjudicated by a review committee of neurologists and psychiatrists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 480 cases of (13.3%) incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the total sample, 227 (6.3%) prevalent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 577 (16.0%) MCI, and 2,318 (64.4%) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The adjudication committee classified 69% of the incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), 11% as vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), 16% as both, and 4% as other types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a substantial agreement between pre- and postMRI diagnosis of types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> within the CHS cohort which survived to the end of the study in 1998-1999, was 13.5% for white men, 14.5% for white women, 22.2% for black men and 23.4% for black women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The CHS has developed a methodology for longitudinal studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in large cohorts and represents the largest study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> including cognitive testing, MRI and genetic markers </plain></SENT>
