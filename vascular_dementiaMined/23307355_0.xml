<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (AHT) and cognitive problems, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, are very prevalent among the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AHT is a direct risk factor for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and recent studies have shown that it also has repercussions on the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, given the fact that there is currently no effective treatment, the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with the aim of delaying or even preventing its appearance is a priority </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it leads us to pose the question as to whether treating AHT can help prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To answer this question, we present a review of the main studies involving interventions with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi> in the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> that have been published to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These trials and meta-analyses suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment could reduce the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> by 3-20%, although with no clear statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there are a number of methodological limitations that largely account for the lack of conclusive results in the different intervention studies and which make it possible to deduce that the treatment of AHT does clearly reduce the appearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, clearly further studies on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> need to be conducted with the primary aim of appraising the appearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
