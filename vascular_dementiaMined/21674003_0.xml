<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the association between genetic polymorphisms of a vascular susceptibility gene, Ninjurin2 (NINJ2), and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, which has not been explored previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 275 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and 119 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) patients aged 50 or older were recruited from three teaching hospitals from 2007 to 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Healthy controls (n =���423) with the same age of cases were recruited from the health checkup and volunteers worked at the hospital during the same time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five common (frequency &gt;5%) haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (htSNPs) in NINJ2 were genotyped to test for the association between sequence variants of NINJ2 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> risk, and how vascular risk factors modify this association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Homozygosity of two NINJ2 SNPs was significantly associated with a decreased risk of AD [rs11833579: adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.43; 95% confidence interval (CI)= 0.23-0.80; rs12425791: AOR= 0.33, 95% CI= 0.12-0.96] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five common haplotypes (cumulative frequency= 97%) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The global test for the association between NINJ2 haplotypes and AD was significant (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Haplotype CAGGA was significantly associated with a decreased risk of AD (AOR= 0.32, 95% CI= 0.11-0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No associations were observed for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Inherited polymorphisms of the vascular susceptibility gene NINJ2 were associated with AD risk </plain></SENT>
