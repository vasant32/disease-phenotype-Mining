<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) is the second most common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, cerebrovascular diseases (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) coexist with other causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive impairment</z:hpo> related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> may be preventable and these patients could benefit from therapy, which emphasizes the importance of early detection and accurate diagnosis of VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The conventional concept of VaD is that of multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MID) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, VaD is not only MID; it relates to different vascular mechanisms and different changes in the brain, and has different clinical manifestations with different causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Critical conceptual questions include the cognitive syndrome and the vascular causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is unclear whether the conventional concept of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is appropriate or should be substituted with a milder and broader definition, such as vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> about the causes, especially the role of lesion characteristics and the noninfarct factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The current diagnostic criteria for VaD are based on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> concept </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The NINDS-AIREN criteria include <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, and a relationship between these two disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The criteria define the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, and list supporting clinical features for the diagnosis of VaD, as well as features that make the diagnosis uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The interrater reliability of these criteria is moderate to substantial (kappa .46 to .72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The expected antemortem accuracy using these criteria approaches 90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The challenge is to correctly diagnose combined cases with both vascular and Alzheimer-type pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Main tools in the diagnosis include a detailed medical history, neurological examination, clinical or neuropsychological mental status examination, and basic laboratory examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Brain imaging should always be performed, preferably using magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis, especially in early cases, is usually made by a neurologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The challenge for the primary care physician is to identify the early cases needing further examinations and organizing treatment and follow-up after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
