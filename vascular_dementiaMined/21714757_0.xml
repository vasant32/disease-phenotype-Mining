<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> on reorganisation of the cognitive neural network in patients with post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> using functional MRI (fMRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the right hemisphere were enrolled </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>fMRI was performed before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten out of 14 patients (six in the experimental group, four in the control group) successfully completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> experimental processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The experimental group showed significant improvements in the Mini-Mental Status Examination during the post-treatment evaluation and one-month follow-up compared to the pre-treatment evaluation (p &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No improvement was observed in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the experimental group fMRI showed increased activation in both prefrontal areas, both inferior frontal lobes, and in the left inferior parietal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Increased recruitment of the parieto-frontal networks in the selected patients was considered to be a neural correlate of cognitive improvement induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
