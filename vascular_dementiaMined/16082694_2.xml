<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A case-control study was performed to examine the association between vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and the polymorphisms of the human gene encoding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> regulatory element binding protein-2 (SREBF2) that regulates cholesterol metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 16 genetic variants of SREBF2 were identified in 24 Koreans, and 5 out of 16 variants were genotyped in 207 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients and 207 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significant association with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was shown in 34995G/T with the GT genotype (odds ratio [OR] = 1.57; 95% CI = 1.04-2.37; P &lt; 0.05) and the GG genotype (OR = 0.65; 95% CI = 0.44-0.96; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CGC, the most common haplotype combined with three SNPs, 24489C/T, 34995G/T, and 68891C/T, was associated with the disease (OR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.53-0.97; P &lt; 0.05), and the individuals with the CGC might be less susceptible to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> than those carrying any haplotype including at least one minor allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study implied that the variants of SREBF2 might be genetic factors involved in the pathogenesis of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
