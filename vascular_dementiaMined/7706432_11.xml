<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>VD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> showed the highest levels of both autoantibodies, AD the lowest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From these results a relationship between autoantibody titers and aging seems possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dosage of anti-GFAP and anti-S100 autoantibodies does not appear useful for diagnostic purpose because of the overlap observed among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rather, the presence of these antibodies seems to reflect an alteration of the blood-brain barrier that promotes the access of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system antigens to immunocompetent cells </plain></SENT>
