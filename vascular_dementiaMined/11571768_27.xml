<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Elderly patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> were asked to complete a questionnaire about the diagnosis and other aspects of their clinical summary sent to them by post </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic data included age, gender, marital status and occupation; degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was established by administering the mini-mental state examination and the geriatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scale, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Patients were consecutive attendees of outpatient clinics (old age psychiatry) located in two suburban areas near London </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASURES: Demographic data included age, gender, marital status and occupation; degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was established by administering the mini-mental state examination and the geriatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scale, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred cases were recruited, 53 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 47 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most depressed and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients ( &gt; 75%) liked the idea of reading their diagnosis but 25% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases felt upset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> group, the majority of patients with mild or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> welcomed the idea of knowing their diagnosis; and 13 (100%) of the patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> wished to know (compared with 68% cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None felt upset, and only 39% of them felt pessimistic after reading their own clinical summary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients who also happened to be depressed, a higher proportion (60%) expressed an unfavourable view towards knowing their diagnosis, but only a minority (40%) of them were actually upset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most older married females, especially those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, felt pessimistic afterwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference between patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in their wish to know their diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, even if they felt upset, preferred to be told their diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> tended to express a more favourable view </plain></SENT>
