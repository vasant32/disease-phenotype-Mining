<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients with different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were studied with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and CT imaging of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The overall correlation between CT and NMR findings was good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Areas of hypodensity in cerebral white matter on CT were especially well visualized in the T2-weighted NMR images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hypodense areas were seen in the white matter of patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> but not in those with primary degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the presence or absence of white matter changes may be an important factor in the differential diagnosis of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and primary degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the basis of NMR and CT findings, it was difficult to distinguish between the lacunar state type and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger</z:e> type of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is suggested, therefore, that these two subgroups of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> be commonly named angiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
