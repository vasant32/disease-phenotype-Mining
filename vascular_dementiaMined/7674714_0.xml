<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Until 1970, the definition of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was unspecific and resulted in overdiagnosis of "<z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was replaced by an oversimplified definition based on the notion that vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is practically always a result of infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, since the beginning of the 1990s, the concept of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> has undergone re-evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With the aid of brain imaging, the existence has been demonstrated of circulation-related cerebral tissue changes other than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is now clear that vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> entity possible to subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of the subtypes is subcortical white-matter <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, which is perhaps more common than multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subtype identification is a useful aid to reliable diagnosis, and in the long run it may prove helpful in improving treatment </plain></SENT>
