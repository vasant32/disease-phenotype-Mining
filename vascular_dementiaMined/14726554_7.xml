<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The criteria of the National Institute of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> (NINDS)-Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (AIREN) include thalamic lesions for the diagnosis of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although studies concerning VaD and brain aging advocate the use of fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) or T2-weighted images (T2-WI) to detect ischemic lesions, none compared the sensitivity of these sequences to depict thalamic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a blinded review of T2-WI and FLAIR images in 73 patients fulfilling the radiological part of the NINDS-AIREN criteria (mean age, 71 years; range, 49 to 83 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This sample was drawn from a large multicenter trial on VaD and was expected to have a high prevalence of thalamic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a side-by-side review, including T1-weighted images as well, lesions were classified according to presumed underlying pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total number of thalamic lesions was 214 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two hundred eight (97%) were detected on T2-WI, but only 117 (55%) were detected on FLAIR (chi(2)=5.1; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the mean size of lesions detected on T2-WI and not on FLAIR (4.4 mm) was significantly lower than the mean size of lesions detected on both sequences (6.7 mm) (P&lt;0.001), 5 of the 29 lesions &gt;10 mm on T2-WI were not visible on FLAIR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FLAIR detected only 81 (51%) of the 158 probable ischemic lesions and 30 (60%) of the 50 probable microbleeds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FLAIR should not be used as the only T2-weighted sequence to detect thalamic lesions in patients suspected of having VaD </plain></SENT>
