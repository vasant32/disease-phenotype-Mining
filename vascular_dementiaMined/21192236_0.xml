<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We assessed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> referred to the Academic Memory Clinics at Amiens, Lille, and Rouen University Medical Centers between 2005 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients aged less than 65 years at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptom were included in the EOD group, whereas older patients were included in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (LOD) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three thousand four hundred and seventy-three patients (including 1932 women) were included and 811 (23.4%) were classified as EOD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sex ratio was 1.12, whereas women were overrepresented in LOD (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with EOD were more frequently (P=0.001) living at home (87.3%), they had a lower educational level than the general population (P=0.0001) but were more educated (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The current Mini Mental State Examination did not differ (P=0.3) between EOD (18.6±7.6) and LOD (18.9±6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common causes of EOD were Alzheimer's (22.3%) and vascular (15.9%) diseases and 4 pathologies that were significantly more frequent (P=0.001) than in the LOD group: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (9.7%), alcohol-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (9.4%), traumatic brain injury (3.8%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington's disease</z:e> (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EOD is characterized by specific features and different causes although Alzheimer's and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> remain the main causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in EOD </plain></SENT>
