<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the absence of any specific diagnostic criteria, CADASIL diagnosis is based on mutational scanning of Notch3, which is a large gene composed of 33 exons with a high G-C content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we examined the sensitivity of denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First we established the theoretical optimal parameters, then we examined a large collection of amplicons in which we had previously identified distinct pathogenic mutations or polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We further performed Notch3 mutational scanning in five patients suspected of CADASIL diagnosis in which previous scanning, including SSCP and heteroduplexes analysis, failed to detect any pathogenic mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DHPLC resolved 97% of mutations previously detected by sequencing and allowed identification of two novel pathogenic mutations: R607C and F984C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that DHPLC is a sensitive screening method particularly suitable for epidemio-genetic screening of CADASIL </plain></SENT>
