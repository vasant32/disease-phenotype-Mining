<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The postural function was better in positions with open eyes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 groups, but significantly less in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> patients, indicating a misinterpretation of afferent visual stimuli in the brainstem postural centre </plain></SENT>
