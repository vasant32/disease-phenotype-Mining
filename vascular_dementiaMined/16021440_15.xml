<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is a high correlation between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> and the pathology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) on brain biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is an overlap between AD and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), suggesting that a correlation exists between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> and other forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study seeks to (1) understand the physiological factors behind, and (2) define the ability of, the aqueduct <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume to exclude <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> co-morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> clinic were classified as having either early AD or VaD on the basis of clinical features, Hachinski score and neuropsychological testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were compared with 16 subjects with classical clinical findings of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> and 12 aged-matched non-cognitively impaired subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRI flow quantification was used to measure aqueduct <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume and arterial pulse volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An arterio-cerebral compliance ratio was calculated from the two volumes in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The aqueduct <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume was elevated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, with no significant difference noted between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The arterial pulse volume was elevated by 24% in VaD and reduced by 35% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>, compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (P = 0.05 and P = 0.002, respectively), and was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a spectrum of relative compliance with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> compliance in VaD and reduced compliance in AD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The aqueduct <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume depends on the arterial pulse volume and the relative compliance between the arterial tree and brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The aqueduct <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume cannot exclude significant co-morbidity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
