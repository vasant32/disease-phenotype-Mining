<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, pain reporting in 20 patients with possible vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) was compared to 20 nondemented elderly who had comparable pain conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was hypothesized that, due to de-afferentiation, the possible VaD patients would experience more pain than the cognitively intact elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pain assessment was conducted using three visual analogue scales, (1) the Coloured Analogue Scale (CAS) for Pain Intensity, (2) the CAS for Pain Affect, and (3) the Faces Pain Scale (FPS); a verbal pain questionnaire, Number of Words Chosen--Affective (NWC-A) of the McGill Pain Questionnaire; and an observation scale, the Checklist of Nonverbal Pain Indicators (CNPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results showed a significant increase in the scores on the CAS for Pain Affect and the FPS in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a tendency for an increase in scores on the CNPI in the VaD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that patients with possible VaD suffer more pain than healthy elderly without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
