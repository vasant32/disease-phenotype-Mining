<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In Japan, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) has been responsible for the majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases in both epidemiological and neuropathological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, however, several epidemiological investigations have shown that the rate of VD has decreased and senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer type (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e>) is now the major cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, though few neuropathological investigations show that the majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to clarify the rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> types in Japanese nursing home residents and to compare the ratio of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> to VD in the first and second halves of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and twenty-two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> nursing home residents (48 men and 74 women) were evaluated neuropathologically over a period of 17 years in Shimane prefecture, Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects died between 1976 and 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 81.4 +/- 9.4 years for men, 85.0 +/- 7.2 for women and 83.6 +/- 8.3 for total samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In classifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> type, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> accounted for 34% (41 cases); VD 35% (42); mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> 11% (14); and 'other' <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> 20% (25) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the first 9-year period with the second 8-year period revealed the ratio of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> to VD tended to increase (from 0.83 to 1.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This increasing tendency was found both in men (from 0.53 to 0.7) and in women (from 1.13 to 1.44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These tendencies, however, were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was no change statistically in the ratio of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> to VD between the first half of the study and the second half </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, there was an increasing tendency of the ratio in our study </plain></SENT>
