<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To address this issue, the present study examined the significance of qualitative analyses of CD in AD and VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-seven AD patients, 44 VD patients and eight controls underwent a clock drawing test and took the Mini-Mental State Examinations (MMSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups, quantitative scores significantly decreased compared with controls and were significantly correlated with MMSE scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Qualitative analysis demonstrated that in AD patients qualitative error patterns were stable and independent of severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in VD patients the frequency of graphic difficulties and conceptual deficit increased, while the frequency of spatial and/or planning deficit decreased, as severity worsened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups the frequency of spatial and/or planning deficit was significantly higher in VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups, the frequency of graphic difficulties was significantly higher in VD and the difference in the frequency of spatial and/or planning deficit seen in mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that qualitative analyses of clock drawings could demonstrate the neuropsychological profiles of AD and VD and their differences between these <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
