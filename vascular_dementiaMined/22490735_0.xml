<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six groups of different cognitive status were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 438 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognitive subjects (NC) from Jing'an community of Shanghai </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five other groups were from the Memory Clinic at our hospital from June 2006 to June 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were subjective memory complaints (n = 443, SMC), mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (n = 540, MCI), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>-non <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n = 119, VCI-ND), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (n = 337, AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n = 54, VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants finished a battery of neuropsychological tests and completed the survey of such comorbidities as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, conscious disturbance, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, head injuries and <z:mp ids='MP_0001426'>excessive drinking</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The comorbidity rates of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 11.4%, 9.9%, 16.1%, 14.2%, 12.4% and 18.5% in 6 groups (NC, SMC, MCI, VCI-ND, AD, VaD) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no differences for overall or pairwise chi square tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001426'>excessive drinking</z:mp> in patients of VCI-ND and VaD were higher than those of SMC, MCI and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The comorbidity rates in the VCI-ND and VaD group were 54.6% vs 62.9% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; 61.3% vs 79.6% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>; 22.6% vs 37.0% for <z:mp ids='MP_0001426'>excessive drinking</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Whereas in the SMC, MCI and AD groups, the rates were 9.4%, 10.9% and 3.0% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; 44.9%, 47.2% and 42.1% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>; 18.0%, 18.3% and 15.1% for <z:mp ids='MP_0001426'>excessive drinking</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No distinct differences existed for the comorbidity rates among SMC, MCI and AD groups or among different degrees of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Etiologies rather than severities determine the different rates of comorbidities in the elders with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
