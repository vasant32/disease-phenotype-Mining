<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether semantic memory is impaired in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and to assess the utility of semantic memory measures in differentiating vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer's type (DAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Ten patients with Cambridge <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e> in the Elderly (CAMDEX) diagnosis of 'definite' mild or moderate vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (mean age 77) were individually matched with 10 patients with a CAMDEX diagnosis of 'definite' DAT on the basis of age, education, sex, premorbid IQ (as measured by the National Adult Reading Test) and performance on the Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, 10 age, sex and education matched volunteer or relative controls were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OUTCOME MEASURES: A detailed semantic memory test battery consisting of five subtests: category fluency, picture naming, picture sorting, word-picture matching and generation of verbal definitions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, both patient groups were impaired on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subtests of the semantic battery with the exception of the word-picture matching test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences were found between the vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and DAT groups on any of the measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Impairment of semantic memory is a feature of both vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and DAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tests of semantic memory appear, therefore, of little value in differentiating between these two major causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further work is required to determine whether the nature of the processing deficit is the same in these conditions </plain></SENT>
