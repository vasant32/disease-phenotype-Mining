<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The resulting deafferentation may increase the experience of pain in VaD and in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of the present study was to examine the relationship between CRF and pain in a sample of 107 cognitively impaired nursing home patients who had also a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> pain condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of pain in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was higher (25/41=61% of them had pain) than those without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (of whom 24/66=36.4% had pain, p=0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate logistic regression model (adjusted for gender, age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>) the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was a risk indicator for pain: odds ratio: 3.48, p=0.005, 95% CI: 1.45-8.38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This finding supports the hypothesis that as a result of CRF, disruptions of cortico-cortico and cortico-subcortical pathways occur, and consequently, enhances pain in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
