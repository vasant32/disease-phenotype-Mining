<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine whether rivastigmine, a dual inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22972">butyryl</z:chebi>-cholinesterase (BuChE), has any effects on the typical symptoms of subcortical VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving rivastigmine showed a slight improvement in executive functions and in behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Side effects in both groups were tolerable and there were no study withdrawals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there are no drug interactions with other therapies previously and concomitantly assumed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Improvements in domains that characterize subcortical VaD were observed, indicating that rivastigmine may have provided targeted treatment in areas of the brain that are particularly affected in this patient population </plain></SENT>
