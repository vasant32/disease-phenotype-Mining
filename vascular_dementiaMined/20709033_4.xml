<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Plasmin is the key active protease in the plasminogen system and is capable of cleaving Aβ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we investigate plasminogen <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels, plasminogen and plasmin protein levels and plasmin activity levels in post-mortem AD and control brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasminogen and plasmin distribution in the human brain was demonstrated by immunoperoxidase staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasminogen <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were measured in 20 AD, 20 control and 15 Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) brains by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In an expanded cohort of 38 AD and 38 control brains plasminogen and plasmin protein levels were measured by dot blot and Western blot, respectively, while plasmin activity levels were measured by fluorogenic assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasminogen and plasmin were present mainly in the neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasminogen <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were unaltered in the AD or VaD groups compared to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasminogen and plasmin protein levels were not significantly altered in AD compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Plasmin activity was reduced in AD but this did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast to some studies these data do not support the involvement of plasmin in the abnormal accumulation of Aβ in AD </plain></SENT>
