<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The papers were searched on Medline and Lilacs and the inclusion criteria were: to be an original study, that estimated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> prevalence and investigated community samples </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age-specific prevalence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were 1,17% for the 65-69 years group, and 54,83% over 95 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were strongly influenced by age </plain></SENT>
