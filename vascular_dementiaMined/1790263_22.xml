<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first part of the study was carried out on 108 AD patients and 57 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (NCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neither the plasma level of insulin nor that of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> differed significantly between the two groups before the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT), whereas there was a significantly greater increase of the plasma insulin in the AD group than in the NC group after the OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second part of the study was carried out on 54 AD patients, 44 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), and 26 NCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early in the morning after overnight fasting, there was no significant difference in the fasting plasma level of either <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or insulin, or the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) level of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, among the three groups, However, the CSF level of insulin was significantly higher in the AD group than in the other two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that an abnormally high level of insulin, not only in the peripheral blood after OGTT load but also in the CSF after fasting, may be associated with the pathology of AD </plain></SENT>
