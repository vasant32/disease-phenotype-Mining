<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between the progression of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (SCI) and levels of soluble <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred twenty middle-aged and elderly diabetic patients without histories of vascular events were followed up for a period of 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured levels of soluble intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1 (sICAM-1), vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1, E-selectin, and hs-CRP and assessed brain ischemic lesions by magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and 3 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was observed in 13% of the patients at baseline, and these patients were significantly older and had significantly higher blood pressure than those without SCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients had newly diagnosed SCI after 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in factors such as age, blood pressure, and diabetic control between patients without SCI and those in whom it was newly diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, only sICAM-1 levels, but not the other soluble <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules or hs-CRP, were associated with the progression of SCI, and this relationship remains after adjustment for risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, higher levels of sICAM-1 and hs-CRP at baseline were observed in 7 patients who were excluded from the present study because of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our present study suggests that sICAM-1 levels may be a potential marker for SCI, which may lead to future <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and that this marker could be useful in monitoring disease progression and as a surrogate marker in treatment studies </plain></SENT>
