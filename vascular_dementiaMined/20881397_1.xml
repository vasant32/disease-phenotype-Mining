<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-two SIVD patients had a diagnosis of no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (NCI), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>/no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whole-brain DTI histography and routine MRI were performed on these participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were significant differences between cognitively impaired patients and NCI subjects in mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy in either whole-brain white matter (WBWM) or in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing white matter (NAWM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> DTI indices within either WBWM or NAWM were found to be significantly correlated with both the attention-executive and memory measures in SIVD subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lacune numbers and Tâ‚‚-weighted lesions correlated only with attention-executive measures, whereas hippocampal volumes correlated only weakly with memory measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whole-brain gray matter volumes correlated with Z scores for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cognitive domains but language </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After VaD patients had been excluded from the analysis, cognitive measures remained significantly correlated with some of the DTI indices, but not with conventional MRI findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with conventional MRI, whole-brain DTI is a more reliable and sensitive technique for the early detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in SIVD patients </plain></SENT>
