<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>MRI scans of 27 patients with probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (mean age 68.2 years), 31 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (mean age 69.9 years) and 18 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (mean age 66.3 years) were compared to evaluate possible distinguishing parenchymal abnormalities among these groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>Atrophy</z:mpath> was quantitated by subjective rating, linear and volumetric measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A number of findings were significantly more common in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> than in the other subsets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These included (1) basal ganglionic/thalamic hyperintense foci, (2) thromboembolic infarctions, (3) confluent white matter and (4) irregular periventricular hyperintensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Signal abnormalities on intermediate T2-weighted scans in the uncal-hippocampal or insular cortex were frequently and almost exclusively noted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moderate and severe cortical and ventricular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and a third ventricular to intracranial width ratio larger than 7% were good discriminators between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> groups and normally aging controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Selective <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> measurements, however, failed to separate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that MRI has the potential to increase the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
