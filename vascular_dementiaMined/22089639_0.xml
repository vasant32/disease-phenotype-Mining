<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We examine historical changes from 1992 to 2008 in the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and accompanying neuropsychiatric symptoms among persons presenting for evaluation and treatment at a multiracial urban <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed intakes of white (n=197) and black (n=568) patients seen at a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> center in New York City </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intakes were divided into 3 time categories: period 1 (1992 to 1996), period 2 (1997 to 2002), and period 3 (2003 to 2008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses included the following: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (73%), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (13%), mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (9%), mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (2%), and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over the 3 assessment periods, persons increasingly presented at an earlier stage of illness with significantly higher levels of cognition and functioning, and a declining prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033975,C0459435" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Finding" abbrv="">psychotic</z:e> symptoms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blacks had a more advanced stage of illness, lower cognitive scores, and a greater prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033975,C0459435" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Finding" abbrv="">psychotic</z:e> symptoms than whites in period 1, but not during the other time periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no racial differences in functioning, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Over the period 1992 to 2008, patients were increasingly more likely to present with early stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and fewer symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033975" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychoses</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo>, and racial differences in illness severity and neuropsychiatric symptoms disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If our sample reflects trends in the United States, then it suggests that more persons will be in care for longer periods of time, previous research findings derived from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> centers must be considered historically specific, and clinicians must be prepared to work with persons with milder forms of neurocognitive disorders </plain></SENT>
