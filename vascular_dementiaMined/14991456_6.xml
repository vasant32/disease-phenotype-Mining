<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">Pyruvate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase complex activity (PDHc) is one of the enzymes known to be reduced, while succinate dehydrogenase activity (SDH), another enzyme of oxidative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism is unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of vascular type (DVT), variable changes in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism have been demonstrated in vivo, while changes of enzyme activities in post-mortem brain tissue are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, PDHc and SDH activity were stimulated with each of the two stereoisomers of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30314">alpha lipoic acid</z:chebi> in post-mortem parietal brain cortex of patients with DAT, DVT, and one case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236642" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pick's disease</z:e> and compared to stimulation effects in a control group, matched for age, sex, post-mortem delay, and storage time of brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PDHc in DAT and DVT, but not in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236642" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pick's disease</z:e> was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PDHc activity could be slightly stimulated by 10 micro M of the physiological stereoisomer (r)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30314">alpha-lipoic acid</z:chebi>, in controls and DVT (possibly also in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236642" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pick's disease</z:e>), but not in DAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups investigated SDH was activated by 100 micro M and 1 mM of both isomers of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30314">alpha-lipoic acid</z:chebi>, whereas 10 mM of both stereoisomers of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30314">alpha-lipoic acid</z:chebi> caused an inhibition of both, PDHc and SDH activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The loss of basal and of (r)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30314">alpha-lipoic acid</z:chebi> stimulated PDHc activity indicate that a functional or structural impairment of PDHc may exist in DAT and DVT which is not merely attributable to loss of mitochondria since basal and stimulated SDH activities are similar in controls, DVT and DAT, thus indicating selective vulnerability of PDHc </plain></SENT>
