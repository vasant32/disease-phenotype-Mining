<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although decreased neuronal connectivity in white matter has been reported to be a key mechanism of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, assessment of white matter changes by diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging in relation to measures of associative function has not been previously addressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the loss of interhemispheric neuronal connectivity in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> by measuring diffusional anisotropy of the corpus callosum and determining its relationship to the regional cortical activity as reflected by cortical perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine patients with multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> and six healthy volunteers (25-35 years old) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We developed a method to determine the active cortical volume (ACV) by masking <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-123 iodoamphetamine SPECT scans to eliminate the effect of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The anisotropic rate (AR) was calculated as a ratio of two perpendicular diffusion coefficients in diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the ACVs of the healthy volunteers, there were significant decreases in the ACVs in the frontal associative areas in the patients, and these were significantly correlated with cognitive scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frontal ACVs showed good correlations with the AR of the anterior corpus callosum among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants; however, only insignificant trends toward correlation were observed between these two parameters within the patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A possible relationship between diffusional anisotropy of the anterior corpus callosum and frontal associative function was suggested; however, an estimation of the decrease in neuronal connectivity in patients with multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> in terms of the deterioration in diffusional anisotropy requires further documentation </plain></SENT>
