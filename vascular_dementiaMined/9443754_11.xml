<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e>, indicated in MRI by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> (LIs) and deep white matter lesions (DWMLs), is said to be accompanied by vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, which is reportedly caused by LI and DWML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To confirm this assumption, 57 patients with cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> were assessed for changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization (rMRGlu) in both white matter and cortex, and these findings were correlated to the results of extensive neuropsychological testing (cognitive, mnestic and attentiveness tests), as well as to MRI findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A special head holder ensured reproducibility of positioning during measurement of rCBF (99mTc-HMPAO SPECT) and rMRGlu (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG PET) and MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>White matter and cortex were quantified with regions of interest defined on MRI and superimposed to corresponding PET/SPECT slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rMRGlu was calculated according to Sokoloff, and rCBF was determined from normalization to the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LI and DWML were graded by number and extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was classified as no to slight inner and/or outer <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (Group A) or moderate-to-severe inner and outer <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (Group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Even in severe DWMLs and in multiple LIs, rCBFs and rMRGlu values were not reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of variance identified <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and neuropsychological deficits as the main determinants for reduced rCBF and rMRGlu values (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, 60% of patients (19 of 31) with neuropsychological deficits in attentiveness tests and 61% of patients (23 of 38) with mnestic deficits belonged to Group A and revealed decreased rCBF and rMRGlu values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological deficits correlated well with decreased rCBF and rMRGlu, whereas MRI patterns, such as LI and DWML, did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that LI and DWML are epiphenomena that morphologically characterize cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> or neuropsychological deficits, however, are exclusively reflected by functional criteria (rCBF and rMRGlu), as long as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> does not occur </plain></SENT>
