<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of WMH was significantly higher in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, especially in posterior periventricular regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results showed no difference in any neuropsychological measurement between healthy aged adults with and without WMH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients with WMH were more impaired in tests of visuoconstruction, attention, finger-motor speed, and latency of tactile identification of objects compared with patients without WMH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These impairments were related mainly to posterior periventricular WMH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no relationship between WMH and global cognitive functioning in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The degree of WMH was related to age and blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that specific regional WMH may result in specific neuropsychological impairments </plain></SENT>
