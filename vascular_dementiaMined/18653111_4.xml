<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients subsequently admitted to the Memory Clinic of the National Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology between March 1995 and February 1996 were registered in a specially designed data sheet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three vascular examinations (ECG, Doppler examination of main extracerebral arteries on the neck, ophthalmoneurological examination) were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The risk factors and vascular alterations were condensed in two factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither the descriptive data nor the two factors showed statistically significant differences in the main groups (probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>--n=24, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>--n=23, mixed forms--n=15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on our results: vascular risk factors and pathological changes can occur in probable form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>; they can be present in early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> form as well; the most marked changes are in the vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> group; relevant findings lack any correlation with each other in the point of severity of vascular changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The extremely high cardio-cerebrovascular morbidity in Hungary seems to be reflected in the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The role of vascular risk factors and (subclinical) pathological findings seem worth exploring further in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
