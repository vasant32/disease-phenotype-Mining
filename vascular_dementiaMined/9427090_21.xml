<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal study of behaviour in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, with autopsy follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, living at home with a carer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lived in Oxfordshire, UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-seven people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and/or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) who were living at home with a carer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASURES: At 4-monthly intervals, the carers were interviewed and the subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were assessed cognitively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects' behaviour was assessed using the Present Behavioural Examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is an investigator-based, semi-structured interview consisting of eight main sections covering many different aspects of behaviour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 121 main questions, with 66 further 'nested' questions, have been shown to have high reliability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This article analyses the types of behaviour change reported by carers at the point of entry to this long-term study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Few correlations were found between behaviour and age, gender and time since <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Some types of behaviour were significantly more prevalent in those with greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Many of these changes create problems for carers, for example increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behaviour</z:hpo>, wandering, wakefulness at night, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">incontinence</z:e> and persecutory ideas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In general, they are more prevalent in people with more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
