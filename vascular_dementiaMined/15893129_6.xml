<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the biggest stumbling blocks in developing effective drug therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> has been the lack of a comprehensive hypothesis that explains the mechanism behind <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the histopathological changes seen in patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An overview of the currently popular 'amyloid' and 'vascular' hypotheses for AD demonstrates that neither hypothesis by itself can explain <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the known histopathological and biochemical lesions seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The paper presents a hypothesis that tries to explain the mechanism behind almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the histopathological changes, and varying clinical manifestations seen in both diagnosed AD and Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> [VaD] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The new hypothesis is based on the known dual toxicity of beta amyloid to both vascular and neuronal tissues, their synergy and the resultant net effect on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and progression of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The new hypothesis therefore will be known as the Amyloid Beta Synergistic Endothelial and Neuronal Toxicity [ABSENT] hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ABSENT hypothesis will try to show the common chemical mechanism behind almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the pathological changes seen in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to the ABSENT hypothesis, beta amyloid itself generates <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the free radicals that cause both vascular dysfunction and the neuronal damage seen in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The chemical mechanism proposed is based on evidence from physical chemistry experiments, calculations as well as in vitro/in vivo experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ABSENT hypothesis does not favor one mode of beta amyloid-induced brain damage over the other, rather it considers the net effects of the neuronal stress/damage caused by both the cerebrovascular dysfunction and direct neurotoxicity caused by beta amyloid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis states that each patient has a different balance of predisposing factors that modulate the extent of neurotoxicity and cerebrovascular dysfunction caused by beta amyloid and thereby explains the wide range and mixed nature of damage and dysfunction seen in the studies done on patients diagnosed with AD, VaD or 'mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>According to the hypothesis, beta amyloid <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> are necessary if not sufficient to cause AD, VaD and mixed senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis, therefore, proposes the term Beta Amyloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementias</z:hpo> [BAD] to describe the conditions currently covered by the diagnoses of 'AD', 'VaD' and 'Mixed [senile] <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementias</z:hpo>' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Finally, the ABSENT hypothesis tries to put forth a direct chemical mechanism behind the apparent synergy and increased association between old age, pre- and coexisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and AD </plain></SENT>
