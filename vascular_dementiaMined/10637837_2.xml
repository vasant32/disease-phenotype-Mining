<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To find the prevalence of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> syndrome in the population aged over 60 years in the municipality of Marianao, La Habana, during the first three months of 1998, and the relationship with certain associated biosocial factors </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The probable diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> syndrome or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> was based on criteria of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> III R and NINCDS-ADRDA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A second analytical phase was done by studying cases and witnesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate hypothesis tests were done by means of the multiple logistic regression method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> syndrome was 8.2% (6.27-10.42); and that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 5.13% and 1.93% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age, female sex, previous clinical history and no spouse (due to widowhood or being single), were risk factors in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Early detection of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> syndrome allows development of projects to intervene in old people to actively improve their state of health and socio-familial adaptation </plain></SENT>
