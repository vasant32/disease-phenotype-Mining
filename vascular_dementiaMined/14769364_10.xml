<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prone spontaneous hypertensive rats (SPSHRs) as a model for <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> frequently occurring in humans with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, high b value q-space diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was shown to be very sensitive to the pathophysiological state of the white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the spinal cords of SPSHR rats ex vivo after the appearance of motor impairments using diffusion anisotropy and q-space diffusion imaging (measured at a high b value of up to 1 x 10(5) s/mm(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diffusion anisotropy images computed from low b value data set (b(max) approximately 2500 s/mm(2)) showed a small but statistically significant decrease (approximately 12%, P &lt; 0.05) in the diffusion anisotropy in the spinal cords of the SPSHR group as compared to control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, more significant changes were found in the high b value q-space diffusion images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The q-space displacement values in the white matter of the SPSHR group were found to be higher by more than 70% (P &lt; 0.002) than that of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations concurred with electron microscopy (EM) that showed significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> in the spinal cords of the SPSHR group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results seem to indicate that high b value q-space DWI might be a sensitive method for following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003447'>axonal loss</z:hpo> associated with vascular insults </plain></SENT>
