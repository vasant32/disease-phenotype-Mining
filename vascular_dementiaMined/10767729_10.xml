<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and diagnostic accuracy of CT measurement of MTL thickness for patients with probable AD, compared with a 'diseased' control group, and to correlate the measure with neuropsychological test scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred subjects were prospectively recruited: 60 with probable AD (mean age 73.7 years, mean Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] 19.6), 17 with probable vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) (mean age 77.9 years, mean MMSE 20.9), 14 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (mean age 73.2 years, mean MMSE 25.7) and nine with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030484" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">paraphrenia</z:e> (mean age 74 years, mean MMSE 25.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Axial and temporal lobe-oriented CT brain was performed and the minimum MTL thickness was measured electronically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean minimum MTL thickness was significantly smaller in AD subjects compared to VaD (p&lt;0.0001) and psychiatric subjects (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the clinical diagnosis of probable AD, the sensitivity of the measure was 0.75, specificity 0.9, and diagnostic accuracy 0.81 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the mildest cases of AD (CDR 0.5), the sensitivity of the measure was 0.61, specificity 0.91, and diagnostic accuracy 0.81 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant correlations with neuropsychological test scores were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Temporal lobe-oriented CT imaging is a non-invasive test with good discrimination for AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Potential uses of this technique include as an aid to diagnosis and possibly as a means of monitoring disease progression </plain></SENT>
