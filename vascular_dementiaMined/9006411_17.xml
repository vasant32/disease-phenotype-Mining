<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To document the presence and treatment of selected vascular risk factors in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and elements affecting undertreatment of vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Secondary analysis of the Canadian Study of Health and Aging database, which is a national, representative, cross-sectional study of the epidemiologic distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in elderly people in Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Institutionalized and community-dwelling elderly people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Vascular risk factors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnosed by standard methods, and medication use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatable vascular risk factors occurred significantly more often in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) than in patients with probable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For example, 76% of patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 57% of those with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, compared with only 5% of those with probable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> and 7% of those with no cognitive loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, the comparable figures are 55%, 48%, 24%, and 38%, respectively.) Potential undertreatment of vascular risk factors had little effect on mean control of vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For example, the mean (+/- SD) systolic blood pressure in those being treated was 144 +/- 26 mm Hg, compared with 142 +/- 25 mm Hg in those not receiving pharmacological treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In each group (treated vs untreated), the proportion of patients with a systolic blood pressure higher than 160 mm Hg was 20% and 16%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Potential undertreatment occurred most often in those with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and those living in nursing homes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vascular risk factors occurred more commonly in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> compared with other patients, including those with other forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When present, such risk factors were often treated pharmacologically, except in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and those in long-term care institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Undertreatment does not, in general, result in worsened risk factor control </plain></SENT>
