<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ACTH CSF levels of patients (4.0 +/- 2.4 fmol/ml, M +/- SD) were significantly lower than in controls (9.8 +/- 5.0, P less than 0.01) the lowest values being found in Alzheimer type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (ATD: 3.1 +/- 2.5) and in patients with radiological evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> (2.5 +/- 1.2), independently of the probable origin of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although beta-LPH and beta-EP levels of patients fell within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, they were lower in ATD than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> sustained on a vascular origin </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data indicate the ACTH impairment as typical of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, supporting in humans the positive role of this <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> on learning and mnesic functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the maintained CSF levels of both beta-LPH and beta-EP in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> sustained on a vascular origin, while lower values were found in ATD, could represent a differentiation between vascular and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1285162" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">degenerative diseases</z:e> of the Central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>Nervous</z:mp> System (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
