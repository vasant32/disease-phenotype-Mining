<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using data obtained from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, we evaluated the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (IS) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) in patients with AD (n = 980) who had no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, or other cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1285162" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">degenerative diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our evaluation period spanned from 2000 to 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed a 1:5 case-control matched analysis, in which cases were matched to controls according to their estimated propensity scores, which were based on demographics and existing vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This approach reduced selection bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was then used to estimate the risk of IS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> in AD, conditional for matched pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, patients with AD had a higher risk of IS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> than those without AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of IS in AD cases and non-AD controls was 37.8 and 23.2 per 1,000 person-years, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.66 (95% confidence interval, 1.37-2.01, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> in AD cases and non-AD controls was 5.2 and 3.0 per 1,000 person-years, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.70 (95% confidence interval, 1.03-2.79, p = 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Clinical diagnosis of AD is associated with considerably increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> development </plain></SENT>
