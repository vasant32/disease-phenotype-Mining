<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine the extent to which the performance in neuropsychological tests would be able to predict the clinical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The LADIS (Leukoaraiosis and Disability) is a prospective study that evaluates the impact of WMC on the transition of independent elderly to disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjects were evaluated at baseline and yearly during 3 years with a comprehensive clinical, functional and neuropsychological protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At each visit, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was classified according to clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The performance in the neuropsychological batteries was compared according to the clinical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From the initially enrolled 639 subjects, 480 were evaluated at year 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 90 participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> subjects had worse performance in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the baseline cognitive tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using receiver operating characteristic curves, we found that the Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Assessment Scale (VADAS) battery had higher sensitivity and specificity rates (area under the curve = 82%) to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> compared with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Assessment Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Worse performance on baseline MMSE (beta = 0.33; p &lt; 0.001) and VADAS (beta = -0.07; p = 0.02) were predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (regression analyses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Performance on the MMSE and the VADAS battery were important predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at a 3-year period </plain></SENT>
