<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty cases of VD were randomly divided into acupuncture group and medication (Duxil, 40 mg/time, 2 times/d for 10 weeks) group, with 30 cases in each group. "Xiusanzhen" means that two acupuncture needles were penetrated subcutaneously from bilateral Yingxiang (LI 20) to Shangyingxiang (EX-HN 8) respectively, and the 3rd needle was penetrated from the midpoint between two Yangbai (GB 14) through Yintang (EX-HN 3) to the nasal root, followed by applying EA stimulation to the acupoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hasegawa's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Scale (HDS), Mini-mental state examination (MMSE), and Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) were used for assessment of the VD patient's state before and after the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After the treatment, the total effective rates of acupuncture and medication groups were 80.00% and 73.33% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effective rate of acupuncture group was significantly superior to that of medication group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Before treatment, scores of HDS, MMSE and FAQ in both groups had no significant differences (P&gt;0.05); after the treatment, the scores of HDS and MMSE increased significantly, and that of FAQ decreased remarkably in both groups (P&lt;0.01), and the difference of scores (or absolute value of FAQ) between post-treatment and pre-treatment in EA group was obviously higher than that in medication group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Acupuncture of "Xiusanzhen" is effective in the treatment of VD patients </plain></SENT>
