<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six institutionalized geriatric patients with particularly severe and longstanding <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were selected by chart review and were studied neurologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Criteria for clinical diagnosis are derived, and it is shown that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> had caused or contributed to their <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> in 33 patients (91.7%) and probably did so in two others (97.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> may not be rare and may be much more prevalent than may now be considered the case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As 23 patients (63.9%) showed evidence of carotid and/or vertebrobasilar involvement, large-vessel disease also may be more prevalent in geriatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> than is now thought and should be considered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results further confirm that careful review of ward records without reference to psychiatric diagnoses of etiology is a simple, rapid, and reliable method of screening a large institutionalized population for possible arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The selectees should then be surveyed appropriately to confirm the presence of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since a careful review of the complete hospital records and a thorough neurologic examination proved sufficient, more definitive but more dangerous invasive diagnostic procedures may not be necessary for clinical pharmacologic and similar investigations </plain></SENT>
