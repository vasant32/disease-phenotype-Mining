<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical condition known as vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> remains poorly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few studies have attempted a correlative link between the clinical syndrome and the structural abnormalities of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Classically the clinical progression of the vascular dementing process is thought to be a multi-step process punctated by repeated episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, that are clinically expressed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In most instances it has been assumed that the substrate of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> consists of atherothrombotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The objective of this report is to illustrate 3 cases of progressive (rather than stepwise) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e> without clinical evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, evolving over a period of several years, in which there were prominent vascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A complete autopsy and detailed neuropathologic examination demonstrated cerebral vascular lesions involving small arterial vessels (&lt; 200 microns in diameter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lesions consisted of moderate-to-severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878486" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriolosclerosis</z:e> in two cases, and mild-to-moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878486" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriolosclerosis</z:e> in a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Parenchymal lesions consisted of small cortical and subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, most of them smaller than 0.1 cm in average diameter, and subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> severe in two cases and mild-to-moderate in the third case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> not accompanied by large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was also present in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Arterial changes affecting small, distal branches causing sometimes small parenchymal lesions in association with diffuse cerebral white matter disease, appear to be the anatomical substrate that accompanies progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in some patients who are frequently diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> because in their clinical records there is neither history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> nor stepwise progression of symptoms </plain></SENT>
