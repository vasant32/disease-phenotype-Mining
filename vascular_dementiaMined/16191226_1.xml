<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several sets of clinical criteria have been published in an effort to establish the presence or absence of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in a standardized fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies have demonstrated that they identify different groups of patients and are thus not interchangeable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Retrospective clinicopathological correlations have shown that most are insufficiently sensitive, although they are generally relatively specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They accurately exclude pure <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> but may include 9% to 39% of mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> combined) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to develop better performing criteria that could lead to a broad consensus on the clinical diagnosis of vascular and mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
