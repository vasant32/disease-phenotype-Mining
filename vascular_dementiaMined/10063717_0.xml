<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rheology parameters may become important factors in regulating cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes in rheologic determinants of erythrocytes and to discuss the relation of erythrocytes and white matter lesions in this type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-eight patients suffering from BD and a control group matched for age, sex and cerebrovascular risk factors were tested for the following hemorheologic variables: erythrocyte deformability, erythrocyte membrane fluidity, erythrocyte aggregation, plasma viscosity and whole blood viscosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, red cell membrane metabolic parameters, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and individual membrane <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> (SA) and malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) contents, and ATPase activities were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant decrease in erythrocyte deformability, erythrocyte membrane fluidity, membrane <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi>, membrane <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi>, membrane SA and membrane ATPase activities, and a significant increase in membrane cholesterol, cholesterol to total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> ratio, <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>, broad viscosity and erythrocyte aggregation were observed in BD patients when compared with those of the matched control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Changes in erythrocyte membrane parameters, especially in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, can produce serious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> and influence the rheologic properties of erythrocytes in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These alterations can contribute to a circulatory slowdown and may lead to worsening of the condition of the cerebral white matter in these patients </plain></SENT>
