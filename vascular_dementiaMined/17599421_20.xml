<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies have shown a greater prevalence of global <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>, and incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, there have been no randomized trials of the effects of long-term glycemic control on cognitive function and structural brain changes in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary aim of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (ACCORD) Memory in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (ACCORD-MIND) is to test whether there is a difference in the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and structural brain change in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated with standard-care guidelines compared with those treated with intensive-care guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This comparison will be made in a subsample of 2,977 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> participating in the ongoing ACCORD trial, a clinical trial sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) with support from the National Institute on Aging (NIA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data from this ACCORD substudy on the possible beneficial or adverse effects of intensive treatment on cognitive function will be obtained from a 30-minute test battery, administered at baseline and 20-month and 40-month visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, full-brain magnetic resonance imaging will be performed on 630 participants at baseline and at 40 months to assess the relation between the ACCORD treatments and structural brain changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The general aim of ACCORD-MIND is to determine whether the intensive treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a major risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, can reduce the early decline in cognitive function that could later evolve into more cognitively disabling conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This report presents the design, rationale, and methods of the ACCORD-MIND substudy </plain></SENT>
