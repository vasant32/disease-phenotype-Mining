<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conventional definitions identify the patients too late, miss subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> short of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and emphasize consequences rather than causes, the true bases for treatment and prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We should throw out current diagnostic categories and describe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> clinically and according to commonly agreed instruments that document the demographic data in a standardized manner and undertake a systematic effort to identify the underlying aetiology in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased effort should be targeted towards the concept of and criteria for Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive Impairment</z:hpo> and Post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> as well as for genetic factors involved, especially as these categories hold promise for early prevention and treatment </plain></SENT>
