<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They suggested that this level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo>, particularly in a sample that should not experience <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo>, is comparable to published base rate studies of malingering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study examined <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo> to date and personal information/place as indicators of malingering following a mild head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A mild head injury group (MHIG) in litigation was compared to patient groups with diagnoses of a psychiatric condition, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and moderate to severe closed head injury group not in litigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the MHIG, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo> to date and personal information/place was present in 7.4 and 5.7% of the sample, respectively, and significantly less than that found in the other three neurological groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>Disorientation</z:hpo> to date was more common in the MHIG when compared to the psychiatric controls, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo> to personal information/place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relying on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo> as an indicator of malingering, at least for mild head injured litigants, may underestimate its prevalence </plain></SENT>
