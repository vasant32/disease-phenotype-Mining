<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and its subtypes in Japanese-American men and compare these findings with rates reported for populations in Japan and elsewhere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: The Honolulu Heart Program is a prospective population-based study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> established in 1965 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prevalence estimates were computed from cases identified at the 1991 to 1993 examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cognitive performance was assessed using standardized methods, instruments, and diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Subjects were 3734 Japanese-American men (80% of surviving cohort) aged 71 through 93 years, living in the community or in institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age-specific, age-standardized, and cohort prevalence estimates were computed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cause) defined by 2 sets of diagnostic criteria and 4 levels of severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prevalence levels for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were also estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> prevalence by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e>, Third Edition, Revised ranged from 2.1% in men aged 71 through 74 years to 33.4% in men aged 85 through 93 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age-standardized prevalence was 7.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prevalence estimates for the cohort were 9.3% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cause), 5.4% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (primary or contributing), and 4.2% for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (primary or contributing) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More than 1 possible cause was found in 26% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>/vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> ratio was 1.5 for cases attributed primarily to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> in older Japanese-American men in Hawaii appears to be higher than in Japan but similar to European-ancestry populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> appears to be slightly lower than in Japan, but higher than in European-ancestry populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further cross-national research with emphasis on standardized diagnostic methods is needed </plain></SENT>
