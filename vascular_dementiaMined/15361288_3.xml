<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: An important aspect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) is loss or impairment of cholinergic neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is controversial whether there is a similar cholinergic impairment and cerebral deficit of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>) in the case of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to explore the levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> (Ch) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with AD and VD, and their possible relationship with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two AD patients, twenty-two VD patients, and twenty <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were recruited and scored with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSF concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> and Ch were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography with an electrochemical detector (HPLC-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp>) and the results were then compared to cognitive status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> concentrations in CSF of AD patients [(10.7 +/- 5.1) nmol/L] and VD patients [(16.8 +/- 7.4) nmol/L] were both significantly lower than in controls [(34.5 +/- 9.0) nmol/L, t = 10.67, P &lt; 0.001; t = 6.91, P &lt; 0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both results correlated positively with MMSE scores (rs = 0.88 and rs = 0.85, respectively, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CSF concentration of Ch was significantly higher in VD patients [(887.4 +/- 187.4) nmol/L] compared to AD patients [(627.6 +/- 145.1) nmol/L, t = 6.4, P &lt; 0.001] and controls [(716.0 +/- 159.4) nmol/L, t = 4.2, P = 0.002] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CSF Ch concentration showed no difference between AD patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, nor did it correlate with MMSE score in any of the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The positive correlation between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> deficit and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> is an important neurotransmitter for memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The similar decrease in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> concentration in AD and VD patients may imply a similar pathogenesis for the process of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> involved in these two disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The elevated CSF levels of Ch in VD patients compared to AD patients may be useful diagnostically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="37733">Cholinesterase inhibitors</z:chebi> may be helpful not only for AD patients, but also for VD patients </plain></SENT>
