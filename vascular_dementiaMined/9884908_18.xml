<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to make a cross-sectional comparison of blood markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in two groups of patients with these disorders and a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional comparative study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Established memory clinics in Cardiff organized by a University Department of Geriatric Medicine within an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> care NHS Trust </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Following a dietary assessment, postprandial venous blood samples were obtained from the following: 25 subjects with probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) (mean age 74.3; 10 F, 15 M); 17 subjects with probable vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) (mean age 75.5; 5 F, 12 M); and 41 controls (mean age 73.4; 24 F, 17 M) for measurement of circulating <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxides</z:chebi> (LP), total <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> capacity (<z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> (VitC), vitamin E (VitE) and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">beta-carotene</z:chebi> (BC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma levels of VitC were significantly lower in subjects with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> compared with controls (VD, 6.5 (4.8, 8.2); controls, 10.0 (8.38, 11.6); VD vs controls, p = 0.015), but no significant difference was seen between controls and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD, mean 8.3 (6.2, 10.4)) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BC levels were similar in subjects with AD and controls, but significantly elevated in those with VD (AD, 0.28 (0.2, 0.34); VD, 0.40, (0.27, 0.53); controls, 0.28 (0.22, 0.34); VD vs controls, p = 0.046) </plain></SENT>
