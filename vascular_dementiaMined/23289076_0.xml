<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The burden of non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">communicable diseases</z:e> is growing, particularly in developing countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The greatest economic burden is due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, the prevalence of which is rising with increasing longevity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Africa, where the rate of increase of elderly persons is the fastest in the world, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is normally dismissed as a part of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ageing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lack of awareness means that many patients are suffering undiagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review aims to assess the information on the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in Africa in order to estimate the current burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A parallel search of Medline, EMBASE and Global Health limited to post-1980 found only 10 relevant studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data on prevalence and risk factors were extracted and analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We modelled the available information and used the UN population figures for Africa to determine the age-specific and overall burden of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in adults older than 50 years in Africa was estimated to be about 2.4%, which translates to 2.76 million people living with a disease in 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>About 2.10 millions of them live in Sub-Saharan Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prevalence was the highest among females aged 80 and over (19.7%) and there was little variation between regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> was the most prevalent cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (57.1%) followed by vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (26.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The main risk factors were increasing age, female sex and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Information on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> prevalence in Africa is very limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further research will not only provide a more reliable estimate of prevalence, and consequently the burden of disease, but will also raise awareness of the problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This is critical in promoting help-seeking behaviour and generating the political commitment to make <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> a public health priority in Africa </plain></SENT>
