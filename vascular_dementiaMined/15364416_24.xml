<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">24S-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi> and 27-hydroxycholesterol in patients suffering from dementing disorders such as AD, VD, and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) were compared to those in age- and cholesterol matched non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> and depressed subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cholesterol corrected concentrations of plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">24S-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi> and 27-hydroxycholesterol were significantly reduced in patients with dementing disorders compared to non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> subjects and depressed patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A strong positive correlation between plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">24S-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi> and 27-hydroxycholesterol levels was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ratios of plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">24S-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi> to 27-hydroxycholesterol were higher in patients with dementing disorders compared to non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results support the observation, that cholesterol metabolism is altered in dementing disorders, indicated by different plasma concentrations of brain specific and peripherally produced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53030">oxysterols</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
