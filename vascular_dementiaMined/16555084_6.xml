<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> CAA is also a significant contributor to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms by which CAA arises are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While neuronal sources of Abeta <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> are sufficient to cause CAA in transgenic mice overexpressing the amyloid precursor protein, there is reason to believe that in aging man, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> modulates the disease process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To better understand CAA mechanisms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, we assessed the frontal cortex of 62 consecutive cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), and mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MD) using immunohistochemistry with antibodies to Abeta, smooth muscle actin and the carboxyl-terminal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> to detect Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While vascular Abeta deposition was invariably associated with smooth <z:mp ids='MP_0000749'>muscle degeneration</z:mp> as indicated by absence of smooth muscle cell actin reactivity, VaD/MD cases exhibited markedly more vascular Abeta(42) deposits and smooth muscle actin loss compared to AD cases with similar degrees of CAA and Abeta(40) deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that distinct mechanisms are responsible for the differential deposition of Abeta in CAA associated with AD and that associated with ischemic/cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is plausible that experimental studies on the effects of cerebrovascular disease on Abeta production and elimination will yield important clues on the pathogenesis of CAA </plain></SENT>
