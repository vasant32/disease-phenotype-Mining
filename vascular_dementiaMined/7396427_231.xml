<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These features are frequently considered primarily characteristic of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Persons with senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer type were clearly differentiable from persons with multiinfarct <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, while the latter two groups were indistinguishable from one another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our sample, eight features were found to characterize those persons with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data verify the usefulness of the Ischemic Score in differentiating between senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer type and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
