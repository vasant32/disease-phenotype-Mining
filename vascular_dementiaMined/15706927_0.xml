<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe inhibiting effect of CGE (compound ginseng extract) on increased expression of IL-1beta and c-fos protein following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> model was made by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of IL-1beta and c-fos were determined by immunohistochemistry in the hippocampus regions in brain tissue at the 0.5 h-7 d after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CGE was diluted by CMC and poured into the stomach by 0.7 mL x (100 g)(-1) with a high dosage (19.34 x 10(3) g x L(-1) row herbs), a middle dosage (9.67 x 10(3) g x L(-1)), a low dosage (4.83 x 10(3) g x L(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were an IL-1ra (rhIL-1ra 20 microg injected into the left cerebral ventricle), a sham operation (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> 20 microL injected into the left cerebral ventricle) and a model as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Compared with control group, three dose groups (low, middle and high) in CGE showed significant inhibiting effects on the expression of c-fos protein at 2, 3, 4, 12 hours and 3 day following cerebral ischaemic-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The level of the inhibiting effects in small and middle groups were lower at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points than that in IL-1ra group (P &lt; 0.05 to P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CGE inhibited the expression of hippocampus IL-1beta protein, taking effect from the 2 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> group (531 +/- 151.1) and MD group (589.3 +/- 78.6) showed more obvious effect which lasted until the 72 h compared with the model group (687.6 +/- 116.7) (P &lt; 0.01 and 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Large dose group (81.3 +/- 16.1) showed the same level of the inhibiting effect on expression of c-fos protein as IL-1ra group (67.2 +/- 25.7) from 4 hour on following cerebral ischaemic reperfusion (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CGE with function of Yiqi Bushen, Huoxue Huatan has effect of inhibiting up-regulated expression of IL-1beta and c-fos protein following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, this effect of CGE starts relatively later than that of IL-1ra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The effect of CGE is associated with its dosage, i.e. a larger dosage has a better effect on expression of c-fos protein in post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
