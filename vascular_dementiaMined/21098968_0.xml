<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) is the second most common dementing illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multiple risk factors are associated with VaD, but the individual contribution of each to disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and progression is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> type 2 (DM) and the clinical variables of VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from 593 patients evaluated between June, 2003 and June, 2008 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> were prospectively entered into a database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 63 patients who fit the NINDS-AIREN criteria for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into those with DM (VaD-DM, n=29) and those without DM (VaD, n=34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The groups were compared with regard to multiple variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with DM had a significantly earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of VaD (71.9 ± 6.54 vs. 77.2 ± 6.03, p&lt; 0.001), a faster rate of decline per year on the mini mental state examination (MMSE; 3.60 ± 1.82 vs. 2.54 ± 1.60 points, p= 0.02), and a greater prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms at the time of diagnosis (62% vs. 21%, p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A history of pre-morbid DM was associated with an earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and faster <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e> in VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, DM was associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A larger study is needed to verify these associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It will be important to investigate whether better glycemic control will mitigate the potential effects of DM on VaD </plain></SENT>
