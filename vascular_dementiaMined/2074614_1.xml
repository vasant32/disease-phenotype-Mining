<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relative frequencies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> and VD in special nursing homes, where usually high concentrations of VD have been noted, were 21% and 52%, respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e>:VD = 3:1) showed that the frequencies of VD in Japanese nursing homes are considerably higher than those in their American counterparts </plain></SENT>
