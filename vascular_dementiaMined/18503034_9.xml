<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent work implicates serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in age-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>, though no study has directly examined this possibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 35 older adults without neurological history underwent fasting blood draw and completed a brief neuropsychological test battery during a single session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for demographic and medical confounds, higher serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels were associated with better performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination (r = .36) and short form of the Boston Naming Test (r = .39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings extend work from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> samples and indicate that higher brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels are associated with better neuropsychological function in healthy older adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The exact mechanisms for this relationship are unknown and require further examination </plain></SENT>
