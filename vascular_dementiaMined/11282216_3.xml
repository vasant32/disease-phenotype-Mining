<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the neuroprotective effects of Hwansodan water extract on the apoptotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of PC12 cells by serum deprivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hwansodan significantly rescued PC12 cells from apoptotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by serum deprivation in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The nuclear staining of PC12 cells clearly showed that Hwansodan attenuated nuclear condensation and fragmentation, which represents typical neuronal apoptotic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hwansodan also prevents DNA fragmentation and caspase-3-like protease activation in serum-deprived PC12 cells and induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins around 44 kDa, which was identified as ERK1 with electrophoretic gel mobility shift by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, MEK inhibitor PD98059 and Ras inactivator, alpha-hydroxyfarnesylphosphonic acid and mevastatin, attenuated the neuroprotective effects of Hwansodan in serum-deprived PC12 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that Ras/MEK/ERK signaling pathway plays a role in neuroprotective effects of Hwansodan in serum-deprived PC12 cells </plain></SENT>
