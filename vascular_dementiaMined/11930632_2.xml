<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ELISA-double enzyme amplification assay was used to detect the total tau and abnormally hyperphosphorylated (p-tau) in cerebrospinal fluid specimens of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD, N = 52, 30 from the Netherlands and 22 from Wuhan and Haikou, China), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD, N = 46, 18 from the Netherlands and 28 from Haikou), and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disease</z:e> (N = 37, 13 from the Netherlands and 24 from Haikou) and of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly controls (N = 56, 26 from the Netherlands, and 30 from Wuan and Haikou) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The measurement of CSF specimens from Netherlands Brain Bank showed that the levels of total tau and p-tau in CSF specimens of AD patients were significantly higher than those in CSF of patients with VD and non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e>, and of age-matched non-neurological <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With CSF tau &gt; or = 370 pg/ml as the marker for diagnosis of AD, the sensitivity, specificity, reliability as well as differentiation rate of AD from VD were 90.0%, 79.0%, 82.8% and 66.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With CSF p-tau &gt; or = 120 pg/ml as the marker for diagnosis of AD, the sensitivity, specificity, reliability as well as differentiation rate of AD from VD were 93.3%, 89.5%, 90.8%, and 83.3% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The measurement of total and phosphorylated taus in CSF specimens of AD and non-AD patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls collected in China showed the similar results; and the sensitivity, specificity, reliability as well as differentiation rate of AD from VD were 77.3%, 85.4%, 83.7% and 71.4% with CSF tau &gt; or = 120 pg/ml as the marker for diagnosis of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between CSF tau and p-tau and age, sex, and seriousness of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Increased phosphorylated tau in human cerebrospinal fluid is a reliable biomarker for diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
