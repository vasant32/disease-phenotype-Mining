<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The increase in SOD activity was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01) in RBCs homogenate of DAT and VD patients, when compared to controls, but no differences appear between the two diseases groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a statistically significant increase in SOD activity (P &lt; 0.01) in DAT patients above 70 years as compared to those 50-70 years old, and a relation between SOD and age were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No changes in SOD activity with age in healthy controls nor in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> group were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant increase in Circulating SOD activity (P &lt; 0.01) was observed in vascular patients compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The observed increase in DAT Circulating SOD activity (against CG) was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increased levels of Cu-Zn SOD, probably represent a general alteration of the oxidative processes characteristic of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> and suggest that the enzyme might be used as a marker </plain></SENT>
