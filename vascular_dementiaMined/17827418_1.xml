<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors measured by immunoassay serum IL-15 levels in 20 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and 15 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and compared them with serum IL-15 levels in 15 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors also studied the effect of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38462">acetylcholinesterase inhibitors</z:chebi> (AChEI) on serum IL-15 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> were found to have significantly lower serum IL-15 levels compared with healthy subjects and patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Healthy subjects and patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> did not differ between each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age, sex, disease duration, and Mini-Mental State Examination score did not affect IL-15 levels in any of the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with AChEI had no influence on IL-15 concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that IL-15 is not implicated in the pathogenetic mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An immune hyporesponsiveness at some point during disease development may be responsible for the lower levels of IL-15 and other cytokines in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
