<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its expression is increased in brain regions affected by AD pathology, and to elucidate if there is a concomitant increase of clusterin also in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e>, CSF samples from patients with AD, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VAD), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>), and controls were analysed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, there were no changes in CSF-clusterin levels from patients in AD, VAD, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, as compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increase of clusterin in brain tissue is suggested to reflect a regenerative response process, which here is shown not to be followed by a concomitant increase in the CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, CSF-clusterin can not be used as an indicator or a diagnostic marker for AD </plain></SENT>
