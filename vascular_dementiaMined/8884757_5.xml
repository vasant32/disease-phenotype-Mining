<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>152 male and female patients aged between 50 and 85 years from two psychogeriatric centers and two nursing homes were initially included in the trial and screened for eligibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>142 patients completed the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical diagnosis was established according to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Allocation of the patients to the primary degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer type (DAT) group or the multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MID) group was based on computed tomography scans, electroencephalographic findings and the Hachinski Ischemic Score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a 12-week double-blind treatment either 30 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9985">vincamine</z:chebi> or placebo was given twice daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Confirmatory statistics included item 2 of the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), the total score of the Sandoz Clinical Assessment Geriatric (SCAG) scale, the subscale 'need for help' of the nurse's rating of geriatric patients (Beurteilungsskala f√ºr geriatrische Patienten; BGP) and the total score of the Short Cognitive Performance Test (Syndrom-Kurztest; SKT) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9985">vincamine</z:chebi> was clearly demonstrated by confirmatory analysis as the drug was statistically significantly superior to placebo in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four target variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The clinical relevance of the outcome was further underlined by the results of the responder analysis of the variables SCAG, BGP and SKT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on the results of this trial, it can be accepted that the therapeutic effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9985">vincamine</z:chebi> is superior to placebo in patients with mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of degenerative and vascular etiologies </plain></SENT>
