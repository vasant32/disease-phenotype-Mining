<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study examined the impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and its severity on Spatial Span performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A neuropsychological battery including Spatial Span was administered to 538 individuals (65-89) who were grouped by consensus into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo>, Amnestic Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive Impairment</z:hpo>, Non-Amnestic Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive Impairment</z:hpo> and cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increase in level of impairment resulted in a decrease in Spatial Span Total Score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A weak relationship between age and Spatial Span Total Score was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spatial Span Forward remains relatively stable regardless of level of impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spatial Span Backward was more sensitive to severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between individuals diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and those with Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> suggesting similar deficit patterns in the cognitive abilities measured by the Spatial Span </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive Impairment</z:hpo> groups and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> did not differ suggesting visuospatial processes are not affected early in the dementing process </plain></SENT>
