<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the development of MRI techniques that are exquisitely sensitive to the products of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, including T2*-weighted gradient-recalled echo (T2*-GRE) and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), CMBs have been detected in ever-increasing numbers of patients, including those with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, as well as in population-based samples of healthy elderly people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our increased ability to image CMBs and hence to see the development and progression of cerebral small vessel disease raises many clinical and pathophysiological questions about the mechanisms, diagnosis and monitoring of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to tackle these questions, it is important to be able to reliably detect, define and map CMBs in the brains of elderly people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this review, we consider radiological detection methods, criteria for defining CMBs (including a practical approach to the identification of CMB "mimics"), and the use of standardised rating scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also briefly discuss the potential for automatically detecting and quantitatively mapping CMBs in future </plain></SENT>
