<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many have vascular risk factors as well as periventricular and deep white matter changes on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Abnormal CSF dynamics, that is, high resistance to outflow or improvement after CSF drainage, indicate good effects of shunt surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors examined whether the worst-case iNPH patients with extensive vascular white matter disease and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CSF dynamics would benefit from shunt surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients also fulfilled the criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a randomized controlled double-blind study was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen consecutive patients fulfilling the above criteria were randomized to receive either open or closed shunts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 3 months after surgery, the patients with initially ligated shunts had their shunts opened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical evaluation consisting of 7 quantitative psychometric and 6 continuous gait tests was performed preoperatively and 3 and 6 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients randomized to receive open shunts had improved motor (30% increase) and psychometric (23% increase) scores 3 months after shunt placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no significant changes between the 3- and 6-month follow-up in these same patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conversely, those with initially ligated shunts were unchanged during the first 3-month period, although they improved in both motor (28%) and cognitive (18%) functions following removal of the ligature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>enlarged ventricles</z:hpo>, hydrocephalic symptoms, and extensive vascular white matter changes benefit from shunt surgery </plain></SENT>
