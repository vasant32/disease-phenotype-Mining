<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 392 out of 886 community dwellers aged 75 years and above living in Kurihara, Northern Japan, agreed to participate in our study; 164 scored a Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating (CDR) of 0 (healthy), 184 scored a CDR of 0.5 (MCI) and 44 scored a CDR of 1+ (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The participants scoring a CDR of 0.5 were divided into 2 subtypes: 37 had vmSVD and 147 had other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective variables were the total MoCA, the MoCA subscale and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a difference in the MoCA and MMSE scores between the 3 CDR groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The MoCA score overlapped in participants with CDR 0 and 0.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were significant CDR effects, while there were no significant infarction effects for the MoCA and MMSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>vmSVD participants had lower scores on the total MoCA, the MoCA attention subscale and MMSE than healthy elderly people and participants with other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that MMSE performed rather well and that the MoCA is not superior to MMSE in MCI and vmSVD participants aged 75 and above in a community </plain></SENT>
