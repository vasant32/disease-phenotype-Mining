<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Non-target, deviant stimuli generate an earlier latency, front-central novelty P3, whereas correctly detected task-relevant stimuli generate a parietal maximal target P3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether the P3 component to novel stimuli is affected by dementing processes, and is therefore useful for distinguishing Alzheimer's type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD) from vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recorded ERPs to task-relevant stimuli (target P3) and novel task-irrelevant stimuli (novelty P3) in an auditory oddball task in AD (n = 16), VD (n = 16), and age-matched controls (n = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The amplitude, latency, and scalp topography of target and novelty P3 were compared among 3 groups using ANOVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationship between P3 measures and intelligence scores were evaluated by correlation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The amplitude, latency and scalp topography of the target P3 were comparably affected by both AD and VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the amplitude of the novelty P3 was markedly reduced in VD, but not in AD, and the scalp topographics were different in the 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The amplitude was maximal at frontal sites in controls, at central sites in AD, and at parietal sites in VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The target P3 latency was prolonged in both AD and VD, whereas the novelty P3 latency was only prolonged in VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AD was discriminated satisfactorily from VD by using the novelty amplitude at Cz and the ratio of the amplitudes at Fz and Pz as independent variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the response to novel stimuli is differentially affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with degenerative and vascular etiology </plain></SENT>
