<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE SUMMARY: A 71-year-old woman visited a psychiatrist in September 2007 for her depressed mood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Her medical history included vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, as well as cardiac pacemaker implantation several years earlier for severe bradyarrythmia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She had begun taking amisulpride 50 mg/day and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi> 2 mg at bedtime 6 months prior to the psychiatrist appointment, with poor relief of her depressed mood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Her drug therapy also included nicergoline 30 mg/day, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> 5 mg/day, aspirin 100 mg/day, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> 16 mg/day, and atenolol 25 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At this psychiatrist visit, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi> 50 mg/day was added for her <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and was continued after a geriatrician visit in October </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Her mood improved significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On December 18, 2007, she was admitted to the cardiology unit to undergo a pacemaker replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Laboratory tests revealed <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase (CK) 7952 IU/L, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase 1021 IU/L, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="7044">myoglobin</z:chebi> 2322 U/L, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> aminotransferase 362 IU/L, resulting in a diagnosis of iatrogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003201'>rhabdomyolysis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Amisulpride and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi> were discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On December 24, serum CK was 839 IU/L and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="7044">myoglobin</z:chebi> was 91 U/L and the patient was discharged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On January 22, laboratory tests showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values of CK, CK-MB, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="7044">myoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">Sertraline</z:chebi> 50 mg/day was again prescribed for the patient's persistent depressed mood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Fifteen days later, blood tests showed CK 1327 IU/L and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="7044">myoglobin</z:chebi> 324 U/L; therefore, the drug was discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CK and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="7044">myoglobin</z:chebi> levels normalized a week later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>On April 2, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36791">escitalopram</z:chebi> was started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>At time of writing, there was no evidence of any increase in CK, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="7044">myoglobin</z:chebi>, or other markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003201'>rhabdomyolysis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The Naranjo probability scale indicated a probable relationship between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi> treatment and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003201'>rhabdomyolysis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>No relationship between amisulpride and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003201'>rhabdomyolysis</z:hpo> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, rechallenge with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi> caused CK and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="7044">myoglobin</z:chebi> to again increase, which was reversed following a discontinuation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The patient's other comorbidities and medications have not been suggested as possible interactions with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi> that can cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0003201'>rhabdomyolysis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Genetic defects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi> demethylation and/or Pglycoprotein binding or concurrent circumstances may explain the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003201'>rhabdomyolysis</z:hpo> in this particular patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0003201'>rhabdomyolysis</z:hpo> was probably induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
