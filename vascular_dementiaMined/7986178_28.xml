<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Neuropsychological measures were compared in clinically defined AD and VAD patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Ambulatory and hospitalized patients were referred to a behavioral neurology clinic and to the neuropsychology department of a teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Consecutive, referred patients who fulfilled National Institute of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> and Related Disorders Association and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e>, Revised Third Edition, criteria for AD and VAD were selected to participate in the study based on the history and clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A modified ischemic score of 3 or less was an independent selection criterion for AD (n = 103) and a score of 4 or more for VAD (n = 25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was used to exclude other structural causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1392786" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive changes</z:e> related directly to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients were matched for age, education, age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MEASURES: The variable measures were the subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R), Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised, Mattis <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating Scale (MDRS), and Western <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>Aphasia</z:hpo> Battery (WAB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients were further stratified into mild and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> categories, based on their performance on the MDRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Variables that were significantly different were selected for discriminant function analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The Writing subtest of the WAB, the Picture Arrangement subtest of the WAIS-R, and the Motor Performance subtest of the MDRS were the best discriminators of AD and VAD in the overall and severely affected populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with VAD performed significantly worse on the MDRS Motor Performance subtest, the WAIS-R Picture Arrangement subtest, the WAB Writing subtest, the WAIS-R Object Assembly subtest, and the WAB Block Design subtest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The AD group performed significantly worse on the WAB Repetition subtest, and patients with severe AD performed significantly worse on the Story Recall test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with VAD performed worse on tests that are influenced by frontal and subcortical mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients with AD performed worse on memory and some language subtests </plain></SENT>
