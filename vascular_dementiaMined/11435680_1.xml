<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We investigated the pattern of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) responses to a cognitive task in vascular patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We studied 8 controls and 18 vascular patients by quantitative rCBF assessed by (133)Xe inhalation method and SPET, both at rest and during a cognitive figure recognition task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight were mildly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> and 10 were nondemented vascular patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to their task performance, 12 patients were classified as 'good performers' (GPs) and 6 patients as 'poor performers' (PPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Vascular patients activated a larger number of brain areas than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed between controls, nondemented and mildly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients in the pattern of rCBF activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GPs presented a lower mean percentage of rCBF increase than either controls or PPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GPs had lower values than PPs in the left temporal, parietal and occipital regions and in the right posterior cingulate and occipital regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that vascular patients may functionally compensate for vascular damage by activating more brain areas than controls do and, consequently, by increasing the rate of regional activation </plain></SENT>
