<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The proportion of various <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> was almost equal in each group: vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 30%; senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer's type, 40%; mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 20%; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 10% </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of those with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was higher in group 2 than group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Those in group 2 scored less on the Mini-Mental State examination than those in group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were assessed by the modified GBS-scale </plain></SENT>
