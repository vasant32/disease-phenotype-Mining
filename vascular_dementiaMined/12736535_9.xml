<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rating scales to grade cerebrovascular disease are available, but their sensitivity to the clinical features of mild SIVD is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study is to devise and validate a computed tomography (CT)-based visual rating scale sensitive to SIVD in patients with mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects were 122 consecutive outpatients of a memory clinic (mean age +/- SD 77 +/- 8 years, 71% females, mean +/- SD score of mental state exam 22 +/- 3, 61% with clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rating of 0.5 and 39% of 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diffuse leukoaraiosis, fuzzy and patchy lesions, and lacunes were assessed on ordinary CT films and weights were computed based on clinical indicators of SIVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A continuous score and an ordinal class (0-3) with higher values indicating higher vascular damage were derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficients for intra- and interrater reliability of the subcortical vascular score and class ranged from 0.84 to 0.88 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Convergent validity versus the scale of Wahlund et al. was good (Spearman's correlation coefficient between 0.53 and 0.73, p &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Known-group validity was assessed versus clinical diagnoses of degenerative (mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> determined by Petersen et al. and NINCDS-ADRDA probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>; n = 58), mixed (possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> with cerebrovascular disease; n = 21), and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (criteria of Erkinjuntti et al. for subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>; n = 43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> were more often in the lower subcortical vascular classes (43% in class 0, 43% in class 1, 14% in class 2, and 0% in class 3), while patients with mixed (0, 24, 24, and 52%) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> were in increasingly higher subcortical vascular classes (0, 12, 35, 53%; p &lt; 0.00005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Criterion-related validity was assessed versus clinical indicators of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50427">platelet aggregation inhibitor</z:chebi> use, balance, gait, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002067'>bradykinesia</z:hpo> increased linearly with increasing subcortical vascular class (p for trend &lt;0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This rating scale is valid and sensitive to capture different degrees of SIVD associated with mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e> </plain></SENT>
