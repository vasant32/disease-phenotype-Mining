<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Behavioral symptoms are common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and seem to be more frequent in men than in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>Agitation</z:hpo> is frequently responsible for caregiver burn-out and leads to institutionalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dramatic increase in the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and related disorders requires better management of behavior symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although environmental adaptation has been proposed recently, for many years, psychoactive medications and physical restraints were the primary approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in severely <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients, both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments are inoperative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this situation, alternative pharmacologic approach should be tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50743">Cyproterone acetate</z:chebi>, an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35497">antiandrogen</z:chebi> and progestative steroid has never been proposed to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behavior</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, but its favorable effect is well described in rat and monkey aggressivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50743">Cyproterone acetate</z:chebi> was proposed for 19 demented patients who developed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behaviors</z:hpo> or an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> unresponsive to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35471">psychoactive drugs</z:chebi> (even in association) or to environmental adaptation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical and behavioral analysis was carried out using the Cohen-Mansfield <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> inventory associated with an assessment of dependency in daily life activities, before and during treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50743">cyproterone acetate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The behavioral status was stable, with permanent or repetitive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 7 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 2 had fronto-temporal degeneration, 2 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington's disease</z:e> and 1 a probable diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients had prominent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behavior</z:hpo> and 4 had predominant aberrant motor behavior with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behavior</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50742">Cyproterone</z:chebi> (50 to 100mg - mean: 92.5mg daily) improved significantly aggressive and impulsive behavior related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> but had no effect on aberrant motor behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>When <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50742">cyproterone</z:chebi> was stopped, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behaviors</z:hpo> reappeared more rapidly in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50743">Cyproterone acetate</z:chebi> is then an interesting choice when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behavior</z:hpo> is not improved with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35471">psychotropic drugs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A detailed clinical analysis is required to avoid the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50742">cyproterone</z:chebi> in non-aggressive and non-impulsive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The results of this preliminary study suggest a randomized double-blind study should be carried out in the near future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The behavior improvement could be related to the blockage of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptors, and simultaneously to the sedative effect of progestative drugs </plain></SENT>
