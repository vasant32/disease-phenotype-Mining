<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the diagnostic ability of 12 short forms among the full sample and in a sub-sample of 69 patients diagnosed with mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) either alone or in combination with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The full BNT (reliability alpha = .90) identified 44% of the AD/VD patients as abnormal on naming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our 30 item short form (alpha = .90) also identified 44% of the AD/VD patients as abnormal, with 93% agreement with the full BNT on abnormal AD/VD patient classifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our 15 item short form (alpha = .84) identified 48% of the AD/VD patients as abnormal, with 90% agreement with the full BNT's abnormal classifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An adaptive 30/15 item version equaled the performance of the full 30 item test while requiring only 15 items for 75% of the patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> naming ability </plain></SENT>
