<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study examined the effects of low-frequency <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> on the rest-activity rhythm and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> levels of patients with probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: It was hypothesised that a decreased level of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> would parallel a positive effect of low-frequency <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> on nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000711'>restlessness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixteen AD patients were randomly assigned to an experimental group (n = 8) or a control group (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The experimental group was treated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e>, whereas the control group received sham stimulation, for 30 minutes a day, during 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rest-activity rhythm was assessed by actigraphy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">Cortisol</z:chebi> was measured repeatedly in the saliva throughout the day by means of salivette tubes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Low-frequency <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> did not improve the rest-activity rhythm in AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, both groups showed an increase instead of a decrease in the level of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest that low-frequency <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> has no positive effect on the rest-activity rhythm in AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An alternative research design with high-frequency <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> in AD is discussed </plain></SENT>
