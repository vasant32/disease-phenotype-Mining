<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is currently based on the recognition and control of vascular risk factors, while specific drugs have not been approved yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nimodipine administered for as long as 26 weeks in improving cognition or slowing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e> in patients defined as having multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R criteria) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and fifty-nine patients were included (128 nimodipine, 131 placebo), and 251 were available for the intention-to-treat analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant difference between drug-treated and placebo patients was noted on the Gottfries-Br√¢ne-Steen scale score (primary efficacy criterion), the remaining neuropsychological tests (Zahlen-Verbindungs-Test, Fuld-Object-Memory Evaluation, Word Fluency Test, Digit Span, Mini-Mental State Examination), and the functional scales (index of Activity of Daily Living, Instrumental Activity of Daily Living, Rapid Disability Scale, Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating), although the majority of changes were in favor of the active drug group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A lower incidence of cerebrovascular and cardiac events was observed in the nimodipine-treated patients in comparison with the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study failed to show a significant effect of nimodipine on cognitive, social or global assessments in patients defined as affected by multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> according to the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A post-hoc analysis (presented in an accompanying paper) suggests that nimodipine may have a favorable effect in the subgroup of patients defined as affected by subcortical (small vessel) vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
