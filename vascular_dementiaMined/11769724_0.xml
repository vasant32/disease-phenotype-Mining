<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (ApoE) epsilon 4 allele and to find the biological peripheral markers for the laboratory diagnosis of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 107 patients with AD, 68 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) and 74 sex- and age-matched non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> healthy individuals (NDC) were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA from patients and healthy individuals was extracted from peripheral blood samples with the <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="59" ids="35255">chloroform</z:chebi> procedure and ApoE was investigated with the methods of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of epsilon 4 was significantly higher in AD than that in VD and NDC and there was no difference in the frequency of epsilon 4 between VD and NDC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease in the group carrying two epsilon 4 alleles was significantly younger than that in the group with one epsilon 4 allele in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in comparison with AD patients without epsilon 4 allele, the age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in the group with one epsilon 4 allele was younger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with epsilon 4 or without epsilon 4 allele in VD patients did not differ significantly in age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, 3 familial AD cases were found, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> carrying epsilon 4 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: AD and ApoE4 were closely related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ApoE epsilon 4 was a dangerous factor of AD and ApoE 4 allele made contribution to the heterogenicity of AD </plain></SENT>
