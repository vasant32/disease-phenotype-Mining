<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Studies reporting that ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (IVD), compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), is associated with relatively greater impairment of executive function and relatively preserved episodic memory raise the question of whether there is a distinctive neuropsychological profile of impairment associated with IVD and whether this might be useful in clinical diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, prior reports are almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> based on clinically diagnosed cases, raising obvious issues of possible circularity and leaving unanswered questions of validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report on clinical and neuropsychological findings in 18 prospectively studied cases that had substantial pathology-defined cerebrovascular disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) at autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine cases had minimal AD pathology, while the remainder had moderate or severe degrees of AD pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cognitive status at last evaluation ranged from mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical features were quite variable; only 40% of cases with high <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> levels had elevated Hachinski <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> Scale scores and neither abrupt <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> nor stepwise progression was found in most high <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> cases, even when AD changes were essentially absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was predictably related to the level of neurofibrillary pathology, but was not related to the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychologists expert in the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> used a priori criteria to diagnose neuropsychological protocols (blind to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other data) from cases with pathology-informed diagnoses of AD, IVD, and mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity were both high for AD, sensitivity for detecting pure IVD was poor, and values were intermediate for detecting IVD irrespective of AD levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A illustrative case example is included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the profile of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in IVD is highly variable, but that in clinical settings neuropsychological readings may contribute to the differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
