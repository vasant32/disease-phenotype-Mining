<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Levels of .OH in the DAT and VAD groups were significantly (P&lt;0.01 and P&lt;0.001, respectively) higher, whereas the values of RBC-SOD/P and RBC-SOD/SOD in these two groups (both P&lt;0.001) and Cu,Zn-SOD/P in the DAT group (P&lt;0.001) were significantly lower than the corresponding control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Members of the VAD group with risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (RF+ group) showed significantly higher .OH levels than members of the VAD group without risk factors (RF- group; P&lt;0.01) and the control group (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RBC-SOD/P and RBC-SOD/SOD values in the RF+ group were significantly (both P&lt;0.01) lower than the corresponding control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences among the VAD, RF+ and control groups with respect to Cu,Zn-SOD/P values, or between the RF- and control groups for any measured parameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> plays a role in the brain damage seen in both DAT and VAD, and that the causes of decreased SOD activity in RBC differ between DAT and VAD patients </plain></SENT>
