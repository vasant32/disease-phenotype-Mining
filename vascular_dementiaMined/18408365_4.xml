<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Deficits in visual processing are a prominent feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), yet the cognitive and neuropathological mechanisms underlying these deficits are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we examined the hypothesis that perceptual organization is specifically impaired in AD compared to other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined perceptual organization with a psychophysically well-controlled measure of contour integration in patients with AD (n = 17), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n = 5), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (n = 5) and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (n = 10) and 11 age-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with AD differed significantly in their ability to detect contours comprised of Gabor elements as detection relied increasingly on long-range spatial interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Impairments in contour integration were particularly pronounced in AD patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> of white matter in the occipital lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Deficits in perceptual organization were not found in patients with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> and participants with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a subgroup of AD patients is characterized by a specific deficit in visual perceptual organization, which might reflect the impaired functional integrity of occipital cortico-cortical pathways </plain></SENT>
