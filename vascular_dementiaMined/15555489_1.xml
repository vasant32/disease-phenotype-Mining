<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is important to identify racial disparities in medication use so that these differences can be corrected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the current study was (1) to evaluate whether black caregivers were less likely to be taking medication than white caregivers after controlling for specific factors and (2) to examine the relationship between caregiver race and other predisposing, enabling, and need factors, and the use of specific categories of medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A secondary analysis of data was conducted from a national survey of 2032 black and white female caregivers of elderly male US veterans with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Caregiver use of specific medications was classified according to the Veterans Affairs medication classification system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017923" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Andersen</z:e> Behavioral Model of Health Services Use provided a framework for multivariate models predicting racial differences in any medication use and use of specific categories of medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Black caregivers were significantly less likely to use any medication than white caregivers (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=0.42; 95% CI=0.31-0.57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These differences persisted even after controlling for other predisposing, enabling, and need factors, and for outpatient doctor visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Black caregivers were significantly less likely than white caregivers to be taking <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi>/metabolic medications (adjusted OR=0.57; 95% CI=0.42-0.77) and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system medications (adjusted OR=0.57; 95% CI=0.39-0.83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this analysis suggest that significant racial differences in medication use exist among informal caregivers providing care for elderly male US veterans with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>progressive dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
