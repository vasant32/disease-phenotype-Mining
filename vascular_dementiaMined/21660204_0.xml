<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), along with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, the most important differential diagnosis for iNPH, has several potential cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers which might help in the selection of patients for shunt treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare a battery of CSF biomarkers including well-known AD-related proteins with CSF from patients with suspected iNPH collected from the external lumbar drainage test (ELD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 35 patients with suspected iNPH patients were evaluated with ELD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSF was collected in the beginning of the test, and the concentrations of total tau, ptau(181), Aβ(42), NFL, TNF-α, TGFβ1, and VEGF were analysed by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients had a positive ELD result-that is, their gait symptoms improved; 9 patients had negative ELD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> analyzed CSF biomarkers were similar between the groups and none of them predicted the ELD result in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Contrary to expectations lumbar CSF TNF-α concentration was low in iNPH patients </plain></SENT>
