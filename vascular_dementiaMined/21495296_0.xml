<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It involves complex interrelationships between vascular etiologies, pathological changes in the brain, and clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is associated with vascular and other risk factors, including cognitive ability, age, and education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is the second most common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, having a high rate of causes by itself, or in combination with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further complicating the diagnosis and treatment of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is that it often coexists with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
