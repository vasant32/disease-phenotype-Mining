<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cells that contain the high (NF-H) and medium (NF-M) molecular weight neurofilaments and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) have been cultured from human brain (Brodmann frontal area 9 and hippocampus) obtained at routine autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three of these cultures (from a 52-year-old man with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, a 75-year-old man with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, and an 80-year-old <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> woman) have been propagated to passage 12-14 and studied in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cellular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was pleomorphic and consistent with a relatively low level of differentiation, by both light microscopic and ultrastructural examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemical reactivity in a characteristic filamentous pattern was observed with monoclonal antibodies to nonphosphorylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> of NF-H and NF-M as well as with redundant antibody probes specific for NF-H and NF-M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting studies confirmed the presence of NF-H and NF-M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemistry and Immunoblotting also demonstrated the presence of NSE, but not of glial fibrillary acidic protein or other glial markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemical studies also indicated the presence of proline hydroxylase, an enzyme found in fibroblasts but not neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies indicate that cells can be cultured from autopsy human brain which are not neurons but nevertheless express molecules used as markers (NF-H, NF-M, and NSE) of adult neurons in vivo and in culture </plain></SENT>
