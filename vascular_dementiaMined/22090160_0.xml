<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The AChE activity showed a significant decrease in plasma and a significant increase in the hippocampus but not in the cerebral cortices in the post-ischemic rats as compared to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The learning abilities and spatial memory were impaired in the post-ischemic rats as compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the AChE activity in plasma was significantly reduced in VaD subjects as compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BuChE activity did not show any change in both post-ischemic rats and VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the decreased AChE activity in plasma from the post-ischemic rats and the VaD subjects showed a significant correlation with the declined learning and memory ability, and the Mini-Mental State Examination score, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the AChE activity is involved in the cognitive recovery after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and the plasma level of AChE might be a reliable supplementary peripheral biomarker to evaluate the cognitive recovery degree of VaD patients </plain></SENT>
