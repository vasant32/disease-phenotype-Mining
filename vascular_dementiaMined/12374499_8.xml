<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the contribution of cerebrovascular disease to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the records-linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology Project to ascertain incident cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in Rochester, Minn, for 1985 through 1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We defined <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> using the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e>, Fourth Edition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To define <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> types, we reviewed neuroimaging reports, which were available for two thirds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases, in addition to medical histories and neurologic examination results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) was defined by 1 of the following criteria: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or worsening within 3 months of a clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or bilateral gray matter infarctlike lesions shown by imaging that fulfilled specified location criteria (critical imaging lesions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found 482 incident cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, 10% of patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or worsening of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> within 3 months of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven percent of the incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases had bilateral gray matter lesions on imaging that were considered critical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighteen percent of patients had one or the other of these features (VaD by our criteria), but only 4% of patients had both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate of VaD increased steeply with advancing age and was similar in men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our incidence rates were similar to those from a recent European meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of either a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> temporally related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or worsening or of critical imaging lesions was common among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients, whereas the occurrence of both features together was rare </plain></SENT>
