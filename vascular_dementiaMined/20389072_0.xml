<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD; n = 210), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD; n = 34), mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI; n = 86) and subjective complaints (n = 153) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of extrapyramidal and unilateral signs was assessed from medical charts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On MRI, WMH volumes were extracted automatically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002071'>Extrapyramidal signs</z:hpo> were found in 10% and unilateral signs in 12% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age- and sex-adjusted <z:hpo ids='HP_0002071'>extrapyramidal signs</z:hpo> occurred more often in VaD compared to patients with subjective complaints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unilateral signs were more prevalent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups compared to patients with subjective complaints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with WMH as the dependent variable showed a main effect of diagnosis (p &lt; 0.001), but not of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002071'>extrapyramidal signs</z:hpo> (p = 0.62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 2-way ANOVA showed main effects of diagnosis (p &lt; 0.001) and unilateral signs (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was an interaction between these factors (p = 0.04); if unilateral signs were present, patients with subjective complaints and VaD showed more WMH, whereas there was no relation in AD and MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Extrapyramidal and unilateral signs are common in memory clinic patients, but are only modestly related to WMH </plain></SENT>
