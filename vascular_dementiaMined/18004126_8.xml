<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The credibility of an increased risk of cerebrovascular events (CVEs) in elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> being treated with second-generation <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi> (SGAs) is debatable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although early published and unpublished data indicated a risk, much of the subsequent literature has not supported this initial finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously published studies were flawed in part because they lacked a control group and did not stratify by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study examined the risk of a CVE in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> while being treated with SGA, first-generation <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi>, or no antipsychotic medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from 14,029 patients aged 65 years and older were evaluated using patient information from Veterans Administration and Medicare databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who received care for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were categorized according to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtype (vascular or Alzheimer) and antipsychotic use during an 18-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were observed until they were admitted to a hospital for a CVE, stopped taking or switched <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi>, died, or until the 18-month observation period ended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, CVE risk did not differ whether patients were receiving a first-generation antipsychotic, SGA, or no antipsychotic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> had an increased risk in hospitalization for a CVE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no increase in risk of a CVE for patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8707">quetiapine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7735">olanzapine</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> relative to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">haloperidol</z:chebi>, or for patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7735">olanzapine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi> relative to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8707">quetiapine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Stratified subgroup analyses demonstrated no difference in risk for CVE-related admission patients with Alzheimer <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> among individual agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi>, but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7735">olanzapine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8707">quetiapine</z:chebi>, were found to be at decreased risk for CVE admission relative to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">haloperidol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study found no increase in overall risk for CVE-related hospital admission in patients treated with antipsychotic medications </plain></SENT>
