<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>THEORY: Mild manifestations of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are relatively widespread among the old-age population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Drug therapy for this disorder is insufficiently effective at present, making it necessary to improve the treatment of such patients by means of an adequate psychotherapeutic and rehabilitation program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To assess the role of psychotherapeutic and rehabilitation measures in improving outcome in the early stage of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The test and control cohorts (each n = 95) were matched for characteristics found to be significant for outcome of treatment (the relevant predictors were found using Multiple Regression Analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cohorts differed in the amount of the psychotherapy and rehabilitation received </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To assess the effects of treatment the SCAG scale and a special scale for evaluating the level of activity in the household were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the test cohort the patients' condition improved significantly compared with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Even in case of only slight therapeutic reduction of psychopathologic symptoms the systematic use of psychotherapeutic and rehabilitation methods favoured preserving a certain level of activity in the household and for some patients even improving it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of therapy at the early stage of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> to a great extent depend on carrying out a full-scale psychotherapeutic and rehabilitation program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The positive significance of the latter is connected not only with improvement of clinical indices but also with direct optimizing the every day life activity level </plain></SENT>
