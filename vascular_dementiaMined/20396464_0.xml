<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The closing-in phenomenon is the tendency to draw near or on the target when copying figures, which has been found mostly in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We attempted to quantify the degree of closing-in and to compare it between patients with AD and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects (55 AD, 39 VaD and 38 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls) were asked to copy the figure of alternating square and triangle, starting at the designated point and continuing from left to right </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients with AD and VaD did not differ in age, education, severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or Rey Complex Figure Test copy score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proximity (Y-axis) of the subject's drawing to the target was plotted at intervals of 2 mm along the X-axis and the degree of closing-in was computed from the slope of the regression line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The AD and VaD patients showed a steeper slope than the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference, however, in the magnitude of closing-in of the AD and VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When closing-in was defined as a slope that was greater than the mean+2SD of the slope observed for the controls, 32.7% of the AD and 25.6% of the VaD patients showed closing-in </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study, using a new method of measuring the degree of closing-in, suggests that this phenomenon is not specific to AD </plain></SENT>
