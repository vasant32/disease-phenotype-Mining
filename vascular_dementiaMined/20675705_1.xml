<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037317" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Disturbed sleep</z:e> is common throughout the community and is associated with an increase in daytime sleepiness, both of which, in turn are associated with an increased risk of ischaemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbances</z:hpo> are predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and in particular vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was tested in a large community-based cohort of older men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A questionnaire on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbances</z:hpo> was administered to 1986 men aged 55-69 years in the Caerphilly Cohort Study and 10 years later the men were examined clinically for evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (CIND) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Approximately 20% of the men reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037317" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disturbed sleep</z:e> and 30% reported 'severe' daytime sleepiness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten years later 1,225 men (75% of the surviving men in the cohort) were tested and 268 (22%) were found to be cognitively impaired with 93 (7.6%) showing clear evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and the remaining 175 (14.3%) showing evidence of CIND </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for possible confounding, including cognitive function and the taking of sleeping tablets at baseline, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbances</z:hpo> appeared to be predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and CIND of vascular origin, while there was no suggestion of prediction of non-vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> by sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prediction of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> appeared to be particularly strong for daytime sleepiness, with an adjusted OR of 4.44 (95% CI 2.05 to 9.61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further adjustments for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e> at baseline reduced the size of the relationships, but the ORs remain large, consistent with a direct positive effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbance</z:hpo> on vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>Sleep disturbances</z:hpo>, and in particular severe daytime sleepiness, appear to be strongly predictive of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, but have no predictive power for non vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
