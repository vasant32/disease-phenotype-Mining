<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, free-hand human figure drawings were examined for 62 demented patients, and 60 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The drawings were scored for 53 body details using a method derived from work with children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A short scale of 15 details was developed by selecting body details with high item-total correlations which are simple to score even for untrained staff </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This short scale had excellent interscorer and test-retest reliability and excellent concurrent validity as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It correlated highly with the Mini-Mental State Examination, a commonly used screening test for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The short scale discriminated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> subjects and different levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity as graded by the Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, no differences were observed between Alzheimer patients and patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> concerning presence of details in human figure drawings </plain></SENT>
