<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The drawings of the NC group were superior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AD patients generally outperformed IVD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> patients; however, there were few differences between IVD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, the drawings of IVD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> patients were very fragmented and contained numerous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233651" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">perseverations</z:e> and omissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite these errors, patients with IVD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> obtained higher delayed recognition memory scores than AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlational analyses among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients between neuropsychological tests and the copy of the M-ROCF found that accurate figure copy was most consistently correlated with tests of working memory, that is, tests requiring patients to monitor their behavior and sustain a complex mental set while performing mental manipulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, no relationship between executive function tests related to measures of response selection/inhibition or other domains of neuropsychological functioning was found </plain></SENT>
