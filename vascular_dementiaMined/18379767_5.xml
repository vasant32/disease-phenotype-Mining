<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Cerebral arterial, venous and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pulsations are closely coupled and this produces pulsation dampening or the windkessel effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>Normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> is a manifestation of the breakdown of this windkessel effect with altered CSF and venous pulsations being noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to show that dysfunction of the windkessel mechanism is also a component of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aging and senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study group comprised 24 patients classified as either early senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer's type (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e>) or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were compared with 12 age-matched non-cognitively impaired subjects, and 12 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> young individuals were compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aging group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI flow quantification was used to measure the nonpulsatile and pulsatile components of blood flow as well as the pulsation at the tentorial incisura </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aging blood flow decreased but arterial pulsations increased in volume by 49% (P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CSF vented via the tentorial incisura does not change significantly with age and therefore increased venous pulsation is necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with VaD the arterial pulse volume was higher by 24% and the straight sinus pulsation was higher by 57% than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aging subjects (P=0.05 and P=0.03, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> the total venous pulsation volumes were similar to those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aging subjects but there was less basal sinus pulsation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> aging, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> and VaD are associated with alterations in venous pulsation due to a breakdown of the windkessel effect </plain></SENT>
