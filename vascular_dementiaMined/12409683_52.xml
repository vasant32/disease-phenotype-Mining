<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was a 28-week, double-blind, parallel, randomized controlled trial of memantine 20 mg daily versus placebo which was conducted in 54 centres in the UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Memantine is a uncompetitive, moderate affinity <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with a diagnosis of probable VaD and Mini Mental State Examination total scores between 10 and 22 were eligible for inclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary efficacy parameters were the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog) and the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 579 patients were randomized and 548 patients with at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment qualified for the intent-to-treat analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At endpoint, memantine was shown to improve cognition relative to placebo in VaD: the change of ADAS-cog from baseline differed by a mean of -1.75 points (95% confidence intervals -3.023 to -0.49) and a median of 2 points between the two groups, while CGI-C ratings showed no significant differences between treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 77% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> memantine-treated patients experienced adverse event, versus 75% of the placebo-treated patients, dizziness being the most frequent adverse event (11% versus 8%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Memantine was well tolerated and safe </plain></SENT>
