<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Previous studies relating smoking with the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> have been inconsistent and limited in their validity by short follow-up times, large intervals between baseline and follow-up assessments, and unspecific determination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We re-assessed after longer follow-up time in the large population-based cohort of the Rotterdam Study whether smoking habits and pack-years of smoking are associated with the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD), and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective population-based cohort study in 6,868 participants, 55 years or older and free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, Cox proportional hazard models were used to relate smoking status at baseline with the risks of incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, VaD, and AD, using never smokers as the reference category in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then Cox proportional hazard models were used to relate pack-years of smoking with the risks of incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, VaD, and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To explore the impact of the APOEepsilon4 allele, sex, and age on the association between smoking status and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, we repeated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> analyses stratifying, in separate models, by APOEepsilon4 genotype, sex, and median of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a mean follow-up time of 7.1 years, current smoking at baseline was associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.86) and AD (HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This increase in disease risk was restricted to persons without the APOEepsilon4 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no association between current smoking and risk of VaD, and there was no association between past smoking and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, AD, or VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Current smoking increases the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This effect is more pronounced in persons without the APOEepsilon4 allele than APOEepsilon4 carriers </plain></SENT>
