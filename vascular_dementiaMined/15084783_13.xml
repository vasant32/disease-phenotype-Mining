<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the association between use of aspirin and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>), incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and the influence of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E epsilon4 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In stratified analyses, a relative risk (RR) of 1.80 (95% CI 1.14-2.83) for AD was seen, in the apoE epsilon4-negative group using aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This implicates a possible different mechanism of developing AD in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also found a possible protective effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> against AD, since no one who used <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> for around 3 years had developed AD 3 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One user developed vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and a low point value of risk was seen, however, not significant (RR 0.23; 95% CI 0.03-1.68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This could be due to the small samples in our study, or to comorbidity contributing to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in this elderly population </plain></SENT>
