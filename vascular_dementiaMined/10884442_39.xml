<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Very few population-based studies have systematically examined incident vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From the Canadian Study of Health and Aging cohort, incidence rates of VaD were determined and risk factors analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a cohort incidence study that followed 8623 subjects presumed to be free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> over a 5-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The risk factors were examined with a nested prospective case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exposure was determined by means of a risk factor questionnaire administered to the subject or a proxy at the beginning of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On the basis of 38 476 person-years at risk, the annual incidence rate was estimated to be 2.52 per thousand undemented Canadians (95% CI 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>02 to 3.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Including an estimation of the probability of VaD among the decedents, this figure rose to 3.79 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the risk factors study, 105 incident cases of VaD according to the NINCDS-AIREN criteria were compared with 802 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant risk factors were: age (OR=1.05), residing in a rural area (2.03), living in an institution (2.33), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (2.15), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (2.41), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E epsilon4 (2.34), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> for women (2.05), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0795691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart problems</z:e> for men (2.52), taking aspirin (2.33), and occupational exposure to pesticides or fertilizers (2.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Protective factors were eating shellfish (0.46) and regular exercise for women (0.46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no relation with sex, education, or alcohol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed some previously reported risk factors but also suggested new ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It raised concerns about the prescription of aspirin and perhaps other factors related to rural life </plain></SENT>
