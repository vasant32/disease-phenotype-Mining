<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> had a greater preference than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls for relatively high-fat, sweet foods and for high-sugar, low-fat foods, but did not significantly differ in preference for other foods, including those high in complex carbohydrates and protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients showed a similar pattern, not significantly different from that for Alzheimer's patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results did not consistently support a hypothesis that increased sweet preference is a nonspecific form of disinhibited behavior related to declining mental status, nor was a hypothesis relating sweet preference to <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> activity within the brain consistently supported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results provide preliminary evidence that craving for sweet food may be a significant part of the clinical syndrome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, but further research is needed to delineate the psychological and biological mechanisms accounting for it </plain></SENT>
