<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This research investigated whether subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and ischaemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (IVD) associated with periventricular and deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter alterations</z:hpo> can be dissociated on tests of declarative and procedural memory, as well as on MRI indices of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter alterations</z:hpo> and the size of the hippocampal formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) and the Pursuit Rotor Learning Tests (PRLT) were used to measure declarative and procedural memory, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects with IVD obtained a higher score on the CVLT recognition discriminability index; however, on the PRLT total time on target, carry-over between trial blocks, and slope calculated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> test trials was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects with AD exhibited the opposite profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI studies indicated that subjects with IVD had considerably greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter alterations</z:hpo>, but larger hippocampal formations than subjects with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Higher scores on the CVLT recognition discriminability index were correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001264'>increased size</z:mp> of the body of the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, as the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter alterations</z:hpo> increased the slope on the PRLT declined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In sum, subjects with AD and IVD can be dissociated on the basis of differing patterns of impairment on tests of declarative and procedural memory, and MRI indices of white matter alteration and the integrity of the hippocampal formation </plain></SENT>
