<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with CADASIL we evaluated the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of beta-amyloid 1-42 (Abeta42), total tau protein (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau protein (p-tau), which are well-accepted biomarkers of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The CSF Abeta42, t-tau and p-tau levels were determined with Innotest beta-amyloid 1-42, Innotest hTAU-Ag and Innotest Phospho-tau 181p sandwich enzyme-linked immunoassay, in 10 CADASIL patients and 17 healthy age-matched subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A case-control statistical analysis was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CSF Abeta42 levels were significantly lower in CADASIL patients than in controls, whereas CSF t-tau and p-tau levels did not differ between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The pattern found in CADASIL patients is similar to that reported in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>, suggesting that decreased CSF Abeta42 might be related to the subcortical vascular lesions in the white matter </plain></SENT>
