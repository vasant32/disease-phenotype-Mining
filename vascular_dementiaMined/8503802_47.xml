<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine which variables best predict prognosis--time to nursing home admission (NHA) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>--in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Survival analysis employing the Cox proportional hazards model with the use of risk variables pertaining to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity and its rate of progression and caregiver functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Patients and their caregivers participating in a controlled intervention study of training for caregivers in home management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Patients with mild Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e>, Third Edition--defined <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (N = 91; 68 patients with Alzheimer-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 20 with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and three with other types) and their caregivers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FOLLOW-UP: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects had repeated assessments in the first year to determine rates of change and thereafter annually to determine the date of NHA and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RISK VARIABLES: (1) Caregiver training; (2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity at index assessment; (3) caregiver stress, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027932" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neuroticism</z:e>, and socialization; (4) changes in patients and caregivers during the first 12 months; and (5) patient characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By 5 years' follow-up, 76% of patients had entered a nursing home and 42% had died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> severity and rate of deterioration ("how far" and "how fast") and caregiver psychological morbidity significantly influenced rates of NHA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Training of caregivers was significantly associated with delayed NHA and reduced mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Greater patient age, non-Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and, unexpectedly, greater caregiver psychological morbidity were associated with shorter survival to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both severity ("how far") and rate of deterioration ("how fast") influence time to NHA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Caregiver training may have important ameliorating effects on the prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
