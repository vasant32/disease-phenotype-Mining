<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to assess the health utilities of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in Europe and identify the key factors influencing their Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study used cross-sectional data from the Odense study; a Danish cohort of patients aged 65-84 living in Odense, Denmark </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 244 patients with mild to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were interviewed together with a caregiver about their health status and activities of daily living (ADL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> was diagnosed according to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were diagnosed according to the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IIIR criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was defined by score intervals on the Mini Mental State Examination score: mild (MMSE 20-30), moderate (MMSE 10-19), and severe (MMSE 0-9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on the ADL information, the patients' dependency level was defined as either dependent or independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Questions from the Odense Study were mapped into each of the five dimensions of the EQ-5D in order to assess patients' HRQol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Danish EQ-5D social tariffs were used to value patients' HRQol.A regression analysis of EQ-5D values was conducted with backward selection on gender, age, severity, ADL level and setting in order to determine the main factor influencing HRQoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The EQ-5D weight in patients independent upon others in ADL was 0.641 (95% CI: [0.612-0.669]), and in those dependent upon others was 0.343 (95% CI: [0.251-0.436]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Dependency upon others to perform ADL was the main factor affecting HRQoL </plain></SENT>
