<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Clinical, epidemiologic, and pathologic observations suggest that vascular risk factors are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">impaired cognition</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies supported an association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and APOE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the underlying mechanism is not clear, it might involve apoE receptors, such as the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39027">very low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The impact of a polymorphic triplet repeat in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39027">very low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> receptor gene (VLDLR) on cognitive function was examined in two independent studies: a population study involving 221 demented subjects compared with 249 control subjects and a clinical study involving 124 demented subjects compared with 179 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the population study, the presence of the VLDLR-5-repeat allele was associated with a relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This result was confirmed in the clinical study (OR, 8.1; 95% CI, 4.4 to 15.1) and was more pronounced in subjects with mixed or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> than in patients with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The VLDLR-5-repeat allele may constitute a genetic susceptibility factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, particularly in the presence of vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This observation suggests the influence of vascular risk factors in the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
