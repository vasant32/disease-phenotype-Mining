<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The maintenance of the effects of Cerebrolysin, a peptidergic compound with neurotrophic activity, on cognitive performance and qEEG activity was investigated through a 12-week, open-label extension of a 4-week, randomised, placebo-controlled pilot study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three out of 41 patients with mild-to-moderate severe probable vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) according to NINDS-AIREN participating in the double-blind phase of the study were also assessed at the follow-up visit at week 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients received i.v. infusions of Cerebrolysin (10 or 30 mL) or placebo (saline) 5 days/week for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological evaluations and qEEG recordings were done at baseline, week 4 and week 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean change in score from baseline in the ADAS-cog+ and the slow-to-fast qEEG power ratio (PR), used as an index of qEEG slowing, were the two primary endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlations between changes in cognition and qEEG induced by the treatment were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the week 16 follow-up visit, Cerebrolysin improved (p&lt;0.05) cognitive performance at the 10-mL and 30-mL doses and reduced qEEG slowing significantly (p&lt;0.05) at the 30-mL dose with respect to the placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, a significant (p&lt;0.05) positive correlation between the change from the baseline qEEG PR and ADAS-cog+ variables was observed at week 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate a persistence of the beneficial effects of Cerebrolysin on cognition and qEEG activity in VaD patients for at least 12 weeks after treatment cessation, and they suggest the potential utility of qEEG parameters as biomarkers for VaD clinical trials </plain></SENT>
