<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) can be useful for distinguishing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disorders</z:e> into categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such analyses can substantially enrich and facilitate clinical diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using MPVA methods, whole brain functional networks, especially those derived using different frequency windows, can be applied to detect brain states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We constructed whole brain functional networks for groups of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) patients and controls using resting state BOLD-fMRI (rsfMRI) data from three frequency bands - slow-5 (0.01∼0.027 Hz), slow-4 (0.027∼0.073 Hz), and whole-band (0.01∼0.073 Hz) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then we used the support vector machine (SVM), a type of MVPA classifier, to determine the patterns of functional connectivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that the brain functional networks derived from rsfMRI data (19 VaD patients and 20 controls) in these three frequency bands appear to reflect neurobiological changes in VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such differences could be used to differentiate the brain states of VaD patients from those of healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also found that the functional connectivity patterns of the human brain in the three frequency bands differed, as did their ability to differentiate brain states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Specifically, the ability of the functional connectivity pattern to differentiate VaD brains from healthy ones was more efficient in the slow-5 (0.01∼0.027 Hz) band than in the other two frequency bands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the MVPA approach could be used to detect abnormalities in the functional connectivity of VaD patients in distinct frequency bands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Identifying such abnormalities may contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of VaD </plain></SENT>
