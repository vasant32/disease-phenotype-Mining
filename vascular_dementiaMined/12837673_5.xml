<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to validate the diagnostic criteria for alcohol-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The sample consisted of veterans consecutively admitted to a 240-bed VA Nursing Home Care Unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline and follow-up assessments included measures of cognition and functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis and type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was determined within 2 months of admission by a geropsychiatrist using patient interviews, chart review, and information from a structured collateral interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Residents were followed for up to 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data were collected on 192 of the residents, of whom, 158 (82%) were diagnosed with some form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Alcohol-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (ARD) was diagnosed in 16 residents (10.1%), probable Alzheimer <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD), in 26 (16.5%); vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), in 46 (29.1); and mixed or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of undetermined origin, in 70 (44.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those with ARD were less cognitively impaired and were more often unmarried </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Residents with ARD demonstrated a stabilization of both cognition and functional status, whereas those with AD and VD showed a general decline in both cognition and functional status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results serve to validate the diagnostic criteria for ARD and suggest that abstinence may be of clinical value in treating patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001973" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">alcohol dependence</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further research needs to be conducted to confirm the value of abstinence </plain></SENT>
