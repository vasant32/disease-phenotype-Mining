<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 221 men and 234 women in the age range of 50-92 were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI), a 100-point cognitive test designed for cross-cultural studies and adapted in Chinese for individuals with little or no formal education, was administered twice by trained field workers with a retest interval of 3 to 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants were assessed by physicians who did not know the CASI scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The physicians' assessment included a complete neurological examination, plus semi-structured tests and interviews covering cognitive abilities, daily activities, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, cerebrovascular disease, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was diagnosed by consensus among the physicians according to the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 455 participants, 16 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were identified, including 13 with probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and 1 each with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001973" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">alcoholism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were 0, 3.9 and 11.5% for the age groups of 50-69, 70-79 and 80-92; and 4.4, 2.0 and 0% for the education groups of 0-1, 2-6 and 7-15 years of schooling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No sex difference was found after controlling for education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Chinese version of the CASI had an intraclass retest reliability of 0.90 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using a cut-off score of &lt; or = 50 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, the sensitivity was 0.88 and the specificity was 0.94 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The preliminary study suggests that the CASI can be used in Chinese populations with generally low education levels and that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> was the most common type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in this population </plain></SENT>
