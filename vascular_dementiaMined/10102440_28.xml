<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, CSF levels of the light subunit of the neurofilament protein (NFL) were increased in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VAD), AD, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (FTD) compared with neurologically healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because NFL is localized mainly in myelinated axons, these results suggest that the degeneration of white matter in these disorders causes the increased CSF NFL levels </plain></SENT>
