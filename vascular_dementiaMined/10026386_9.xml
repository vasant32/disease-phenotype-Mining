<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We conducted a retrospective cohort study to examine whether patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) differed in the number and type of associated comorbid conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, we evaluated the impact of the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> on hospitalization and mortality of patients in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 161,106 patients over age 65, with any degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, residing in any of 1,573 Medicare/Medicaid-certified nursing homes of 5 states of the USA between 1992 and 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were assessed with the federally mandated Minimum Data Set (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> has been cross-linked to Medicare eligibility files and to the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AD patients were younger, and more likely to be female and Caucasian than VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For comparable levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, AD patients appeared to have fewer comorbid conditions, including those that were not risk factors for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with AD had decreased morbidity and mortality relative to patients with VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings support the hypothesis that AD patients are a healthier group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
