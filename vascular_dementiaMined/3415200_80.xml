<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One hundred fifty autopsy brains from patients with clinically diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) were examined pathologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The brains were received consecutively over a 3-year period from numerous sources as part of a research program in which one brain half was frozen for biochemical studies and the other half was fixed in formalin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred thirty-one (87%) of the 150 cases fulfilled histological criteria for AD, with or without additional findings, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At least a minimal degree of amyloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> was found in every brain showing histopathological abnormalities of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three (18%) of the 131 AD brains had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> in neurons of the substantia nigra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of the 19 non-AD cases were diagnosed as other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In only 2 cases was no histological correlate for the patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that (1) the many physicians who diagnosed these cases did so highly accurately; (2) degenerative changes in the substantia nigra were more common in patients with AD than has been reported for the general aged population; (3) amyloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> was a constant accompaniment of AD, although its severity varied widely; (4) vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was rarely clinically misdiagnosed as AD; (5) neuropathological findings were insufficient to account for the clinical syndrome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in less than 2% of cases; (6) the histological criteria established by the National Institutes of Health/American Association of Retired Persons Workshop on the Diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> worked well in assessing this large series </plain></SENT>
