<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (VCI) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) are prevalent conditions with a growing impact on health care expenses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few studies have addressed expenditures on cognitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We quantify the expenses of tertiary-care inpatients with VCI and VaD and provide the first report on the specific cost of care in community-dwelling patients with small- and large-vessel ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009241" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a cost-description study of inpatient expenditures from the Spanish National Health Institute and regional government perspectives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed the expenses in a prospective cohort of 122 community dwellers with VCI who developed small-vessel disease with ischemic white matter disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e>) (n = 60), lacunar state (n = 26), or large-vessel disease (n = 36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Admissions with a primary or secondary diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and other diagnoses related to cerebrovascular disease were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average cost per patient was $33 740 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The costs per VCI admission were similar across groups (~$9545) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average number of admissions increased during the progression of the disease (VCI, 1.2; VaD, 2.5) and contributed to higher expenses per patient during the VaD stage (~$22 631) compared with the VCI stage (~$11 110) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Half of patients (n = 61; 50%) progressed without ischemic events during the VCI stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These patients incurred lower per-patient costs during the VCI stage ($9750 vs $12 464), and costs increased during the post-VaD diagnosis stage ($28 528 vs $16 734) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Large- and small-vessel cerebrovascular diseases are common and costly conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may incur greater expenses than VCI <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, patients with large-vessel disease incurred higher costs during the VCI stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Care became more onerous at an advanced VaD stage in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>During the VaD stage, the expenditures of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> were significantly higher and eventually counterbalanced the initially lower costs seen during the VCI stage </plain></SENT>
