<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to establish the quantitative relationship between metabolite ratios and degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in patients with mild to moderate AD and sub-cortical ischaemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (SIVD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-four older people with clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were recruited from a memory clinic and followed up for 2.0-3.5 years; 20 cases were finally classified as probable AD, 18 as SIVD and 6 as mixed type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and short echo time single voxel automated MRS from the mesial parieto-occipital lobes were performed at the time of initial referral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spearman rank correlation coefficients were calculated for MMSE scores and measured metabolite ratios MI/Cr, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr, Cho/Cr and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/MI </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The SIVD group showed no correlation between any of the measured metabolite ratios and MMSE score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study reinforces the specific association between reduced <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> and increased MI levels in the parieto-occipital region and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in AD </plain></SENT>
