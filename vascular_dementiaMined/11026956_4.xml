<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To study survival, place of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certification in pre-senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Patients aged 45-64 were identified from hospital and community sources in the Northern health region (1985-89) and classified as having pre-senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer type (PDAT) or pre-senile vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (PVD) by applying an algorithm to case notes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Deaths</z:hpo> were ascertained from the National Health Service Central Registry (NHSCR) to 31 December 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival analysis was performed using the SPSS/PC program, and expected survival calculated from life tables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median survival time from diagnosis was 6.08 years and did not differ significantly in PDAT and PVD, or by age or gender; 19.3% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred at home, 24.5% in nursing or residential homes and 56.3% in hospital; 72.4% of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates mentioned <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>; 15.4% were still alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pre-senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> has a variable but usually <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> course, requiring appropriate planning and services </plain></SENT>
