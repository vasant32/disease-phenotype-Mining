<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers beta-amyloid 1-42 (Abeta1-42), total tau (t-tau) protein and tau protein phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181) could discriminate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) from vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CSF samples of Abeta1-42, t-tau, and p-tau181 were collected from probable AD (n=35), probable AD with white matter changes (WMC) indicative of concomitant cerebrovascular disorder (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, n=31), VD (n=20), and an age-matched subgroup of patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> (OND) without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (n=24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AD patients showed very low Abeta1-42 levels (median=393 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abeta1-42, but not t-tau, differentiated AD from VD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the markers did not discriminate AD vs. AD plus WMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In particular, both subgroups showed similar CSF biomarkers but they were significantly different from VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ROC analysis showed that Abeta1-42 could discriminate AD from VD (AUC=0.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cutoff of 493 pg/ml gave sensitivity and specificity values of 77% and 80%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained when Abeta1-42 was employed to discriminate AD with WMC from VD (95% specificity and 60% sensitivity, but with cutoff of 750 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>T-tau increased aspecifically in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cognitively impaired patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>P-tau181 performed better than t-tau in discriminating AD (with or without WMC) vs. VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, Abeta1-42 proved to be a valuable tool to discriminate AD vs. VD patients and possibly to improve diagnostic accuracy in clinical forms, improperly classified as "mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>" based on radiological vascular lesions </plain></SENT>
