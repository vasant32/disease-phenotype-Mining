<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated differences between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) from the appearance of the first cognitive symptoms, focusing on both time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and rate of accelerated decline for different cognitive functions before <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data from a longitudinal population-based study were used, including 914 participants (mean age = 82.0 years, SD = 5.0) tested with a cognitive battery (word recall and recognition, Block Design, category fluency, clock reading) on up to four occasions spanning 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We fit a series of linear mixed effects models with a change point to the cognitive data, contrasting each <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> group to a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant age-related decline was observed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five cognitive tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relative to time of diagnosis, the preclinical AD persons deviated from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aging curve earlier (up to 9 years) compared to the preclinical VaD persons (up to 6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, once the preclinical VaD persons started to decline, they deteriorated at a faster rate than the preclinical AD persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results have important implications for identifying the two <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> disorders at an early stage and for selecting cognitive tasks to evaluate treatment effects for persons at risk of developing AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
