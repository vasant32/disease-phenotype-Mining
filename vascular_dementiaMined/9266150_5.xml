<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>Onset</z:hpo> is in the 40s or 50s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis is made by finding polyglucosan bodies (PB) in histologic sections of brain or spinal cord, peripheral nerve, or dermal sweat glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although 2 pairs of the 22 previously reported cases were siblings, the familial nature of the disease has not been emphasized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report 2 adult siblings, a male and a female, each of whom had the clinical diagnosis of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both were confirmed at autopsy to have APBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We characterized the lesions in autopsy tissues using a battery of histological stains, lectin histochemistry, and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Innumerable PB were distributed throughout brain, heart, skeletal muscle, liver, and dermal sweat glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PB were highlighted by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi> Schiff stain and concanavalin A lectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructurally, PB were composed of aggregates of filaments within axons and astrocytic processes, and lying free in the neuropil, but not within neuronal perikarya </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is important to consider APBD in cases of familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of unknown etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ante-mortem biopsy of axillary skin may be diagnostic </plain></SENT>
