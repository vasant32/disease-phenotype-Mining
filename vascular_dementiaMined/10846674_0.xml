<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main purpose of the research was to identify a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> pattern that discriminates the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the initial stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Two groups of patients, one affected by mild ADT (n = 30) and the other by multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD, n = 30) were given a neuropsychological battery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The battery was composed by Temporal Orientation (Benton et al.); Vocabulary, Similarities, Digits, Coding and Kohs (WAIS) of Wechsler; the Colour-Form Test of Weigh; the Trail Making Test (A and B) (Halstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Battery); Tapping (McQuarrie); Logical Memory, Visual Memory and Paired Association (Wechsler Memory Scale) of Wechsler; Delayed Memory (Russell) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two groups were similar in age and socio-cultural features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The z-score and its statistical significance on the Mann-Whitney test were made and we performed an exploratory discriminant analysis to the classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In general, results were poorer in the ADT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>But we detected no significant differences in the tests, although some test (Immediate Visual Memory and Kohs' Blocks) almost reached significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The discriminant analysis reached a classification of the 67% of the subjects into the ADT group and the 70% of the subjects into the VD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the initial stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> it is difficult to differentiate between a cortical pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in ADT and a subcortical pattern in VD, a distinction that the other researchers have reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When complex tests were used the performance depended on the coordination of multiple related systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings are in agreement with the holistic models of higher mental functions </plain></SENT>
