<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for SAE development were studied in 65 patients (42 men and 23 women, mean age 60.5 +/- 7.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A control group included 31 patients (17 men and 14 women, mean age 59.3 +/- 7.4 years) with isolated clinically meaningful lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A main risk factor for SAE was arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (AH) emerging in 98.5% of the patients, which, according to twenty-four hour monitoring, differed significantly from that in the patients with isolated lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In SAE, diastolic pressure was higher, systolic AP variability was detected more frequent, physiological AP decreased rarely in the nighttime, but AP fell down extremely more often </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A frequency of other risk factors (ischemic disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, smoking, elevation of hematocrit, fibrinogen and platelet aggregation) did not differ significantly comparing to isolated lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>Hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> was detected more frequently in the controls than in the SAE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study revealed that AP with hemodynamic features, pathogenetically crucial for development of disseminated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878486" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriolosclerosis</z:e> in <z:mp ids='MP_0000774'>small brain</z:mp> arteries and arterioles as well as for diffuse white matter damage in brain hemispheres characteristic for SAE, is a main risk factor for SAE </plain></SENT>
