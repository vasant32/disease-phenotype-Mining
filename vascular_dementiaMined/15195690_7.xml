<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Acetylcholinesterase (AChE)/cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors are the only drugs authorized for symptomatic treatment of AD and are also under investigation for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study has investigated the influence of two doses of the AChE inhibitor rivastigmine (0.625 mg/Kg/day and 2.5 mg/Kg/day) on vesicular <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> transporter (VAChT) and on <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase (ChAT) expression in frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum of normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cholinergic markers were assessed by immunochemical (Western blotting) and immunohistochemical techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In frontal cortex and striatum of normotensive rats, treatment with the lower dose (0.625 mg/Kg/day) of rivastigmine had no effect on VAChT immunoreactivity and increased slightly ChAT protein immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The higher dose (2.5 mg/Kg/day) of the compound increased significantly VAChT and ChAT protein immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In hippocampus rivastigmine induced a concentration-dependent increase of VAChT protein expression and no significant changes of ChAT protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A similar pattern of VAChT and ChAT protein expression was observed in control SHR, whereas treatment of SHR with rivastigmine induced a more pronounced increase of VAChT protein immunoreactivity in frontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum compared to normotensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data showing an increase of VAChT after treatment with rivastgmine further support the notion of an enhancement of cholinergic neurotransmission by AChE/ChE inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The observation of a greater expression of this cholinergic marker in SHR suggest that AChE inhibition may provide beneficial effects on cholinergic neurotransmission in an animal model of VaD </plain></SENT>
