<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of physical activity on risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data are from a prospective population-based cohort of 749 Italian subjects aged 65 and older who, in 1999/2000, were cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at an extensive assessment for clinically overt and preclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and, in 2003/2004, underwent follow-up for incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline physical activity was measured as energy expenditure on activities of different intensity (walking, stair climbing, moderate activities, vigorous activities, and total physical activity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over 3.9 +/- 0.7 years of follow-up there were 86 incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases (54 AD, 27 VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for sociodemographic and genetic confounders, VaD risk was significantly lower for the upper tertiles of walking (hazard ratio [HR] 0.27, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.63), moderate (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.66), and total physical activity (HR 0.24, 95% 0.11 to 0.56) compared to the corresponding lowest tertile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association persisted after accounting for vascular risk factors and overall health status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for sociodemographic and genetic confounders, AD risk was not associated with measures of physical activity and results did not change after further adjustment for vascular risk factors and overall health and functional status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, physical activity is associated with a lower risk of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> but not of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed about the biologic mechanisms operating between physical activity and cognition </plain></SENT>
