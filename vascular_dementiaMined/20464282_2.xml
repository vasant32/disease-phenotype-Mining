<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Fifteen patients with mild VaD, 15 patients with mild probable AD and 30 healthy controls, matched for age, education and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity, were submitted to the following cognitive tests: clock drawing (free drawing and copy), category and letter fluency, delayed recall test of figures and the EXIT 25 battery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VaD patients performed worse than AD patients in category fluency (p=0.014), letter fluency (p=0.043) and CLOX 2 (p=0.023), while AD cases performed worse than VaD patients in delayed recall (p=0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, ROC curves for these tests displayed low sensitivity and specificity for the differential diagnosis between VaD and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the performance of VaD and AD patients was significantly different in some cognitive tests, the value of such instruments in differentiating VaD from AD proved to be very limited </plain></SENT>
