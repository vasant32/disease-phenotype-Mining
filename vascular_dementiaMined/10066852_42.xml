<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e>, indicated on MRI by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> (LI) and deep white matter lesions (DWML), is said to lead to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with proven cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> were assessed for changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism (rMRGlu) and compared with 19 age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The findings were correlated with results of extensive neuropsychological testing, as well as with MRI findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A special head holder ensured reproducibility of positioning during rCBF (single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT [SPECT]), rMRGlu (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography [PET]), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>White matter and cortex were quantified with regions of interest defined on MRI and superimposed to corresponding PET/SPECT slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LI and DWML were graded by number and extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Even with severe DWML and multiple LI, rCBF and rMRGlu values were not reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ANOVAs identified brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and neuropsychological deficits as the main determinants for reduced rCBF and rMRGlu values in both cortex and white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological deficits correlated well with decreased rCBF and rMRGlu, whereas MRI patterns such as LI and DWML did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Factor analysis revealed no correlation of LI and DWML with rCBF, rMRGlu, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, and neuropsychological deficits, showing instead positive correlations between rCBF, rMRGlu, and neuropsychological performance and negative correlations of the latter 3 with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: From these data, we conclude that LI and DWML are epiphenomena that may morphologically characterize cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> but do not in themselves indicate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> or neuropsychological deficits, by contrast, are reflected exclusively by functional imaging parameters (rCBF, rMRGlu) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
