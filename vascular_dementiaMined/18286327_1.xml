<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, rather recent findings suggest a comorbidity of neurodegenerative and ischemic pathology in a majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases in later life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of the vascular pathology on the survival time was studied in 173 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> outpatients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For 147 patients with complete datasets, we were able to gain information concerning their survival time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As an indicator of cerebrovascular morbidity the 18-point ischemic scale of Hachinski (HIS) was correlated with the survival time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, we did not use the HIS for its original purpose to differentiate between degenerative and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, but to roughly evaluate the cerebrovascular impact in a continuum model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using the Cox model we calculated mortality risks for every point on the HIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found a Cox hazard ratio of 1.038 for each supplementary point on the HIS, which equals a 3.8% higher relative mortality risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The result misses significance (p=0.092), but indicates a clear tendency towards a shortening of survival time by vascular comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Future prospective studies should integrate brain imaging to further corroborate our findings </plain></SENT>
