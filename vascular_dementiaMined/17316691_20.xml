<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the pathogenic mechanisms remain poorly understood, our studies suggest that radiation-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> may be a form of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a fractionated dose of gamma-rays that is biologically similar to that given to <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumor</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The brains of adult rats were irradiated with 40 Gy, in eight 5 Gy fractions over 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cognitive function was assessed prior to WBI and up to 9 months post-irradiation using a partially-baited radial arm maze </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in working memory errors was found in the irradiated rats by two-way ANOVA (p=0.0042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increased errors occurred primarily at 6 and 9 months (p &lt; 0.05, student's t-test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vessel density was quantified using a stereology method with computerized image processing and analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vessel density was unchanged 24 h after the last dose, but significantly decreased (p=0.002), by approximately 30%, from 10 weeks to 52 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> arose after brain capillary loss in irradiated rats that show no other gross brain pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Capillary loss may play an important role in radiation-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and this may be a model of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
