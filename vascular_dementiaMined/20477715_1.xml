<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its diagnosis is based on relevant history and clinical examination, appropriate imaging findings and physiological testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical picture of idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> may occasionally be difficult to distinguish from that of Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this article is to systematically review the literature from the last 29 years in order to identify cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or imaging biomarkers that may aid in the diagnosis of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors concluded that no CSF or imaging biomarker is currently fulfilling the criteria required to aid in the diagnosis of the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, a few studies have revealed promising CSF and imaging markers that need to be verified by independent groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reasons that the progress in this field has been slow so far is also commented on, as well as steps required to apply the current evidence in the design of future studies within the field </plain></SENT>
