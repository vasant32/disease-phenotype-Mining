<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of insulinic therapy on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in patients with AD and DM-2 treated with either oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs or combination of insulin with other <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 104 patients with mild-to-moderate AD and DM-2 were divided into two groups, according to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> pharmacotherapy: group A, patients treated with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs and group B, patients treated with insulin combined with other oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cognitive functions were assessed by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Clinician's Global Impression (CGI), with a follow-up of 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the end of the study, the MMSE scores showed a significant worsening in 56.5% patients of group A and in 23.2% patients of group B, compared to baseline MMSE scores (P=.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also CGI-C scores showed a significant worsening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> domains after 12 months in group A vs group B (P=.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The two groups were matched for body mass index, serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, Apo epsilon4 allele and smoke habit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversely, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were significantly higher in group B (P=.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for this risk variables, our results remained significant (P=.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that insulinic therapy could be effective in slowing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in patients with AD </plain></SENT>
