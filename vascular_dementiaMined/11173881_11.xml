<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we provide evidence that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> AD cases the vulnerability of peripheral cells to undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is increased compared to non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> elderly controls and, very importantly, to patients with subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (SVE) as another, but <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quiescent 'native' and 'activated' lymphocytes from AD patients that were predisposed to commit apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by priming the cells with interleukin-2, are shown to accumulate apoptosing cells to a significantly higher extent in spontaneous and in <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>-induced in vitro <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate robust differences in cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> sensitivity between AD and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The comparable findings of a higher extent of apoptotic features in neurons and in peripheral blood cells of AD patients are remarkable and may suggest a rather general modulation of apoptotic mechanisms by the disease, which even can be picked up at the level of peripheral lymphocytes under specific in vitro conditions </plain></SENT>
