<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few studies have investigated these associations in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, vascular factors may be involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on the relationship between hemostatic biomarkers and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> remain scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Our study aimed to investigate the relationship between hemostatic biomarkers and the risk of CHD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in an elderly population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS/METHODS: In the Three-City cohort study including men and women aged &gt; or = 65, we investigated the association of fibrinogen, D-dimer and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor with the 4-year incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> (CHD, n = 199; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, n = 111) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n = 218) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measurements were performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases and for a random sample of the entire cohort (n = 1254) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hazards ratios (HR) compared the last quintile with the first of each parameter's distribution and P-values refer to the test for linear trend across quintiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Elevated fibrinogen was associated with the risk of CHD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (HR = 2.20, P &lt; 0.05 and 2.45 P &lt; 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, high D-dimer was associated with the risk of CHD among younger subjects (aged &lt; 75, HR = 3.64, P &lt; 0.01) but not older subjects (P for interaction = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the risk of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) increased with D-dimer level (HR = 3.05, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the elderly, elevated fibrinogen and D-dimer levels were associated with incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, high D-dimer level could represent a new risk factor for VaD </plain></SENT>
