<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its relationship with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, however, remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the relationship of tHcy levels with clinical diagnoses and cognitive performance in a sample of outpatients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma tHcy, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels were assessed in individuals evaluated at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025261" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Memory Disorder</z:e> Unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses included subjective memory complaints (SMC, n = 27), mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI, n = 142), AD (n = 139) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD, n = 17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent extensive neuropsychological testing to evaluate attention, memory, language, and visuoconstructional and executive functions, as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and impairments of daily living activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: tHcy levels did not differ between patients with SMC, MCI, AD or VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased tHcy was associated with worse performance in geometric figure copy and clock drawing tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: tHcy levels did not discriminate between diagnostic groups of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Elevated tHcy levels in these patients appear to have a detrimental effect on visuoconstructional performance </plain></SENT>
