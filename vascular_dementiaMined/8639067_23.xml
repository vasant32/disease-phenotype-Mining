<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional, between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A Veterans Affairs medical center and university memory clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Forty elderly subjects with AD (n = 14), with SIVD (n = 8), and elderly controls (n = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We used 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging to acquire spectra from a 80 x 100 x 17-mm volume superior to the lateral ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spectra were analyzed from voxels in anterior, medial, and posterior gray and white matter using nuclear magnetic resonance-1 and the results were compared between groups using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), Tukey's test, and individual Student's t tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using ANOVA, significantly lower levels of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cho and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr and significantly higher levels of Cho/Cr were observed across both gray and white matter voxels in subjects with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using individual Student's t tests, a significantly lower level of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cho and a higher level of Cho/Cr were observed in the posterior gray matter in subjects with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using ANOVA in subjects with SIVD, significantly lower gray and white matter <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr levels were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using Tukey's test, the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr level was significantly lower in frontal white matter voxels in subjects with SIVD compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings in subjects with AD suggest neuron loss in gray matter, axon loss in white matter, and altered Cho metabolism in posterior brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings in subjects with SIVD are consistent with higher levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi>-containing metabolites and/or lower levels of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> in frontal white matter </plain></SENT>
