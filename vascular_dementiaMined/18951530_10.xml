<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We sought to establish a mouse model of subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (SIVD) that develops predominant white matter (WM) injury and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult C57Bl/6 male (n = 48) mice were subjected to bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> with external microcoils (inner diameters: 0.16 mm, left; 0.18 mm, right) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mice were categorized according to left-side cerebral blood flow (CBF) value on day 6 into those with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> (SCH; n = 16, &lt; 30% of preoperative CBF baseline value) or moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> (MCH; n = 21, 30-50% of preoperative value) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another 15 mice were sham operated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological dysfunction was evaluated by <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp>, rotating rod, and open field tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histopathological examination was performed on day 35 after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MCH animals showed persistent <z:mp ids='MP_0001399'>hyperlocomotion</z:mp> with reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and spatial reference <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rarefaction and small necrotic lesions were predominantly confined to the WM, with reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002446'>astrocytosis</z:hpo>, microglial infiltration, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003447'>axonal loss</z:hpo>, and myelin disruption, and these changes were dominant on the left side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SCH animals had persistent <z:mp ids='MP_0001399'>hyperlocomotion</z:mp> and motor dysfunction, and their ischemic lesions extended from the WM to the hippocampus and cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In MCH animals, myelin basic protein and neurofilament fiber densities in the WM were correlated with the time spent in the correct area in the water maze probe trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our MCH mouse model with the development of several types of neurological dysfunction with high reproducibility would be useful for investigating the pathomechanisms of WM injury in human SIVD </plain></SENT>
