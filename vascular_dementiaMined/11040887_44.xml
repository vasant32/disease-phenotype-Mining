<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine the value of two rating scales to measure fluctuating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The agreement between the clinician-rated scale and the scale completed by a non-clinician was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlations between the two scales were calculated; variability in attention was calculated on a computerised cognitive assessment and variability in delta rhythm on an electroencephalogram (EEG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Clinician Assessment of Fluctuation and the computerised cognitive assessment were completed for 155 patients (61 Alzheimer's disease, 37 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo>, 22 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 35 elderly controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A subgroup (n = 40) received a further evaluation using the One Day Fluctuation Assessment Scale and an EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The two scales correlated significantly with each other, and with the neuropsychological and electrophysiological measures of fluctuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both scales are useful instruments for the clinical assessment of fluctuation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
