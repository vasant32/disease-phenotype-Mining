<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured EPO in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo>, and tested for a correlation with an established biomarker of neuro-axonal damage, tau protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD, N=40), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD, N=19), frontotemporal lobe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FTLD</z:e>, N=5), ALS (N=30) and controls (N=49) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid and serum levels of EPO and tau were measured using ELISA techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found CSF EPO in ALS to be lower than in controls (p=0.04), while no difference between patients with AD, VD, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FTLD</z:e> and controls was detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CSF EPO correlated with age (p&lt;0.001) as well as with tau protein (p=0.002) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients pooled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the upregulation of the EPO/EPOR system in brain tissue upon various conditions of neuronal distress, CSF EPO concentrations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative disease</z:hpo> were found in the same range or even reduced as compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This may be due to a relative deficiency of endogenous <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> EPO in these conditions and/or to a more efficient extraction of free EPO molecules from brain intercellular fluid by increased numbers of EPOR </plain></SENT>
