<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine probabilistic and geographically defined samples participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A screening design based on the MMSE was implemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Positively screened individuals underwent clinical evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The total number of cases in Spain was estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prevalence was confronted to that of other European countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five hundred and forty-six persons aged â‰¥75 participated, 49 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (35 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> [AD], 10 with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> [VD], 4 other; 25 first diagnosed in the study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age- and sex-adjusted prevalence and estimated nationwide cases were 7.5% (95% CI 5.4-9.7), 5.6 (95% CI 3.7-7.5) and 1.4 (95% CI 0.5-2.3), and 290,000 (95% CI 208,000-372,000), 214,000 (95% CI 141,000-288,000) and 54,000 (95% CI 20,000-88,000) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, AD and VD, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> prevalence in Spain is comparable to other European populations, while a high number of undiagnosed cases live in the community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The potential impact of Mediterranean diet, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> control and decreasing vascular risk factors is discussed </plain></SENT>
