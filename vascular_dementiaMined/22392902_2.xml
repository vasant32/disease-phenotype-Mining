<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the joint association of midlife BP and Aβ <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels with the risk for late-life AD and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were 667 Japanese-American men (including 73 with a brain autopsy), from the prospective Honolulu Heart Program/Honolulu Asia Aging Study (1965-2000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Midlife BP was measured starting in 1971 in participants with a mean age of 58 years; Aβ was measured in specimens collected in 1980-1982, and assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and autopsy collection started in 1991-1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The outcome measures were prevalent (present in 1991-1993) and incident AD (n=53, including 38 with no contributing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n=24) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk for AD significantly increased with lower levels of plasma Aβ (Aβ1-40 hazard ratio: 2.1 [95% CI: 1.4 to 3.1]; Aβ1-42 hazard ratio: 1.6 [95% CI: 1.1 to 2.3]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Evidence of interaction between diastolic BP and plasma Aβ (1-40 P(interaction)&lt;0.05; 1-42 P(interaction)&lt;0.07) levels indicated that the Aβ-related risk for AD was higher when BP was higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low plasma Aβ was associated with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> (P(trend)&lt;0.05) but not the other neuropathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aβ plasma levels start decreasing ≥15 years before AD is diagnosed, and the association of Aβ to AD is modulated by midlife diastolic BP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Elevated BP may compromise vascular integrity leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> and impaired Aβ clearance from the brain </plain></SENT>
