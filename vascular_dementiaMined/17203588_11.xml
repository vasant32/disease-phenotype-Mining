<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the noradrenergic system is accessible to pharmacological intervention, the role of LC degeneration and noradrenergic dysfunction in the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of AD needs clarification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hypothetically, loss of noradrenergic innervation could cause microvascular dysfunction and manifest as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to develop a scale for assessment of LC degeneration and to determine whether degeneration of the LC correlates quantitatively with either duration of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, overall severity of AD pathology or with measures of ischemic non-focal white matter disease (WMD) in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This report is a pathological follow-up of a clinical longitudinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> study of 66 consecutive cases of AD without admixture of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) from the Lund Longitudinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Study, neuropathologically diagnosed between 1990 and 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten cases of VaD were included for comparative purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No correlation between degree of LC degeneration and duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, AD or WMD severity was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LC degeneration was significantly more severe in the AD group than in the VaD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Even though LC degeneration was not associated with WMD or the severity of AD pathology in this AD material, we suggest that clinical studies on the consequences of noradrenergic dysfunction are warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment augmenting noradrenergic signaling is available and safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The marked difference in the level of LC degeneration between AD and VaD cases suggests that LC degeneration could be used as a diagnostic marker of AD </plain></SENT>
