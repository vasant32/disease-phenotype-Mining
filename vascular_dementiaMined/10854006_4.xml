<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen essential hypertensives (including 13 males, aged 55-75 years) with at least one 30-60% stenosis of the internal carotid artery at echo-color Doppler examination were treated in a double-blind, randomized, parallel study with lacidipine (4-6 mg od) or HCTZ (25-50 mg od) for 3 months after a 4-week single-blind placebo period </plain></SENT>
