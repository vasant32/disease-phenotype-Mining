<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the underlying mechanisms of the neuropathology of this disorder are virtually unknown, in this study we tested the in vitro effect of LGA on various parameters of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, namely, chemiluminescence, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi>-reactive substances (TBA-RS), protein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi> formation (PCF), total radical-trapping <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> potential (TRAP), total <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> reactivity (TAR), and the activities of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes catalase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase in cerebellum and cerebral cortex of 30-day-old rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LGA significantly increased chemiluminescence, TBA-RS, and PCF measurements and markedly decreased TAR values in cerebellum, in contrast to TRAP and the activity of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes, which were not altered by the acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar but less pronounced effects were provoked by LGA in cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the LGA-induced increase of TBA-RS was significantly attenuated by <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> (N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-5-methoxytryptamine) and by the combinations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> plus Trolox (soluble <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi>) and of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase plus catalase but not by the inhibitor of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase Nomega-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> (L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e>), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase or catalase alone in either cerebral structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that LGA provokes oxidation of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and proteins and reduces the brain capacity to modulate efficiently the damage associated with an enhanced production of free radicals, possibly by inducing generation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radicals</z:chebi>, which are trapped by the scavengers used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, in case these findings can be extrapolated to human L-OHGA, it may be presumed that <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> is involved in the pathophysiology of the brain damage observed in this disorder </plain></SENT>
