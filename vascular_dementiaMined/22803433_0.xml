<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of Bushen Jiannao Recipe (BJR) on the content of acetylocholine (<z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi>) and ERK1 and ERK2 protein expressions in the hipppcampal CA1 region of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) rats, and to explore its possible mechanisms for treating VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-three rats were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The VD model was established by permanent bilateral occlusion of both common carotid arteries (2-VO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then the modeled rats were randomly divided into 5 groups, i. e., the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficit</z:e> model group, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> group, and the positive drug control groups [including high (n = 13), middle (n = 13), and low (n = 12) dose BJR group] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Besides, another 13 rats were chosen as the sham-operative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distilled water was given by gastrogavage to rats in the sham-operative group and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficit</z:e> model group (5 mL/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4696">donepezil hydrochloride</z:chebi> suspension was given to rats in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> group by gastrogavage (0.52 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High (56 g/kg), middle (28 g/kg), and low (14 g/kg) dose of BJR were respectively given to rats in the other three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 30 days of intervention, the escape latency period and platform crossing times were determined using <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The contents of <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi> in the hippocampus and cortex were determined using colorimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The expressions of ERK1 and ERK2 in the CA1 region of the hippocampus were detected using immunohistochemical assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average escape latency of intervened rats showed an overall decreasing trend </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>From the third to the fifth day, the escape latency period was prolonged, the platform crossing times were reduced, the contents of <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi> in the cortex and the hippocampus were lowered, the numbers of positive stained neuron of ERK1 and ERK2 in the hippocampus CA1 region were reduced, showing statistical difference when compared with the sham-operative group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Compared with the model group, the 4th day escape latency of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> group and the high dose BJR group was shortened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The escape latency was shortened, and the platform crossing times, and the numbers of positive stained neuron of ERK1 and ERK2 in hippocampus CA1 region increased on the fifth day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The contents of <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi> in the cortex and the hippocampus increased with statistical difference (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Compared with the low dose BJR group, the 4th- and 5th-day latency period were shortened, the positive numbers of ERK1 and ERK2 in the hippocampus CA1 region increased in the high dose BJR group with statistical difference (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Compared with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> group, the <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi> content in the cortex and the hippocampus of the middle and low dose BJR groups decreased (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BJR could obviously improve the function of learning and memory of VD rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Its mechanisms might be associated with its actions in enhancing <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi> contents of the cortex and the hippocampus, and promoting the protein expressions of ERK1 and ERK2 in the hippocampus CA1 region </plain></SENT>
