<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to evaluate age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> related changes of the basal lamina in cerebral microvessels of individuals, who died from non-cerebral causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We examined 27 human brains: 11 young and 16 old patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Old patients were divided into two subgroups, those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (n = 8) and those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basal lamina changes of the cerebral microvessels were determined in the putamen using antibodies against collagen type IV and by quantitative analysis of vessel number, total stained area of collagen, thickness of the vessel wall and lumen, and relative staining intensity using immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total number of collagen positive vessels per microscopic field was reduced in old compared to young subjects (12.0+/-0.6 vs. 15.1+/-1.2, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relative collagen content per vessel (1.01+/-0.06 vs. 0.76+/-0.05, p = 0.01) and the relative collagen intensity (233.1+/-4.5 vs. 167.8+/-10.6, p &lt; 0.0001) shown by immunofluorescence were higher in the older compared to the younger patients with a consecutive reduction of the lumen / wall ratio (1.29+/-0.05 vs. 3.29+/-0.15, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed for these parameters between old hypertensive and non-hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present data show age-related changes of the cerebral microvessels in sections of human putamen for the first time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Due to the accumulation of collagen, microvessels thicken and show a reduction in their lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Besides this, the number of vessels decreases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings might represent a precondition for the development of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was not proven to modulate these changes </plain></SENT>
