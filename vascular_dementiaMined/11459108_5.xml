<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Groups were matched on age, education, and gender; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups also were matched on severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recognition/retrieval differences were found only between SVaD and AD groups, not between CVaD and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, recognition/retrieval differences are likely secondary to subcortical pathology rather than to vascular etiology per se </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, significant numbers of memory errors were associated with cortical pathology, regardless of etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Error rate differences were found only between SVaD and AD groups, not between CVaD and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, rapid forgetting was unique to AD; however, since no difference was found between SVaD and AD, rapid forgetting may occur only as AD progresses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No semantic memory measure differentiated AD from either CVaD or SVaD subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that some previously reported episodic differences may be due to cortical versus white matter subcortical pathology, rather than to AD versus vascular etiology </plain></SENT>
