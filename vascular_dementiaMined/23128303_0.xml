<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aging is positively associated with AD and VaD risk, but this may reflect comorbidities or the effects of other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> modulators of vascular function such as diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Objective: To explore putative synergistic effects of aging with diet, in this study genetically unmanipulated mice were maintained on diets enriched in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26607">saturated fatty acids</z:chebi> (SFA) or cholesterol and compared to mice provided with low-fat (LF) feed formula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods: The functional integrity of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> was assessed following 3, 6 and 12 months of dietary intervention commenced at 6 weeks of age, by determining the brain parenchymal extravasation of immunoglobulin G (IgG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results: Mice maintained on the SFA- or cholesterol-enriched diet showed significant parenchymal IgG abundance following 3 months of feeding, concomitant with diminished expression of the tight junction protein occludin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LF control mice had essentially no evidence of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six months of SFA feeding exacerbated the difference in IgG abundance compared to the LF mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 12 months of feeding, the control LF mice also had significant parenchymal IgG that was comparable to mice fed the SFA- or cholesterol-enriched diet for 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there may have been an adaptation to the fat-enriched diets because SFA and cholesterol did not exacerbate IgG parenchymal accumulation beyond 6 months of feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Collectively, the study suggests that diets enriched in SFA or cholesterol accelerate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> dysfunction that otherwise occurs with aging </plain></SENT>
