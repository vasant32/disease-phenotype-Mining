<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined mortality in 3602 participants of the Cardiovascular Health (CHS) Cognition Study in four US communities evaluated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> incidence between 1992 and 1999 and followed for 6.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By June 2000, 33 of 62 (53.2%) participants who developed vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) had died compared to 79 of 245 (32.2%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), 66 of 151 (43.7%) with both AD and VaD, and 429 of 2318 (18.5%) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using Cox proportional hazards regression with a time-dependent covariate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> status adjusted for age, gender and race, individuals with VaD were more than four times as likely to die during follow-up than those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognition (HR: 4.4, 95% CI: 3.1-6.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hazard ratios were 2.1 (95% CI: 1.6-2.7) for AD and 2.5 (95% CI: 1.9-3.3) for both types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adjusted accelerated life models estimated median survival from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as 3.9 years for those with VaD, 7.1 years for AD, 5.4 years for mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 11.0 years for matched controls with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While persons with VaD died primarily from cerebrovascular disease, those with AD/mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> died more frequently from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001508'>failure to thrive</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
