<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, the major subtype of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, is caused by a disruption in white matter integrity after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0241832" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular insufficiency</z:e>, no therapy has been discovered that will restore cerebral perfusion or functional cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because adrenomedullin (AM) has been shown to be angiogenic and vasoprotective, the purpose of the study was to investigate whether AM may be used as a putative treatment for subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A model of subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was reproduced in mice by placing microcoils bilaterally on the common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using mice overexpressing circulating AM, we assessed the effect of AM on cerebral perfusion, cerebral angioarchitecture, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, white matter change, cognitive function, and brain levels of cAMP, vascular endothelial growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, mice overexpressing circulating AM showed significantly faster cerebral perfusion recovery due to substantial growth of the capillaries, the circle of Willis, and the leptomeningeal anastomoses and reduced oxidative damage in vascular endothelial cells compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vascular changes were preceded by upregulation of cAMP, vascular endothelial growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>White matter damage and working <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> induced by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> were subsequently restored in mice overexpressing circulating AM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that AM promotes arteriogenesis and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, inhibits <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, preserves white matter integrity, and prevents <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, AM may serve as a strategy to tackle subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
