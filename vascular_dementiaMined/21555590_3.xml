<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CADASIL pathology is characterized by vascular smooth muscle cell degeneration and accumulation of diagnostic granular osmiophilic material (GOM) in vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The functional nature of the Notch 3 mutations causing CADASIL and their mechanistic connection to small-vessel disease and GOM accumulation remain enigmatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To gain insight into how Notch 3 function is linked to CADASIL pathophysiology, we studied two phenotypically distinct mutations, C455R and R1031C, respectively associated with early and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, by using hemodynamic analyses in transgenic mouse models, receptor activity assays in cell culture, and proteomic examination of postmortem human tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that the C455R and R1031C mutations define different hypomorphic activity states of Notch 3, a property linked to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> susceptibility in mouse models we generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, these mice develop osmiophilic deposits and other age-dependent phenotypes that parallel remarkably the human condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proteomic analysis of human brain vessels, carrying the same CADASIL mutations, identified clusterin and collagen 18 α1/endostatin as GOM components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings link loss of Notch signaling with ischemic cerebral small-vessel disease, a prevalent human condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We determine that CADASIL pathophysiology is associated with hypomorphic Notch 3 function in vascular smooth muscle cells and implicate the accumulation of clusterin and collagen 18 α1/endostatin in brain vessel pathology </plain></SENT>
