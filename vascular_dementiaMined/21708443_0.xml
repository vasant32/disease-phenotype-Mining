<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> (BD) is a type of subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, but its clinical features and pathophysiology are still obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore tried to find a topographic distribution of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in BD by morphometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty patients with BD, 50 patients with AD, and 80 elderly controls were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We contrasted the gray matter <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of BD to that of AD to identify a pathognomic pattern using magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used DARTEL (diffeomorphic anatomical registration through exponential Lie algebra) for voxel-based morphometry, expecting that its sophisticated algorithm would work well to deal with the subjects with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>Atrophy</z:mpath> of cortices was predominant in the posterior cortices in AD but was in the anterior cortices in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>Atrophy</z:mpath> of amygdala and hippocampus was similar in each disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, thalamus, caudate nucleus, insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and frontal cortices were significantly more atrophied in BD than in AD (z-score &gt;3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated topographic patterns of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since affected regions of BD match with the anatomical connections of frontal-subcortical circuits, it seems reasonable to suppose that BD pathology is the result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HTN">hypertensive vascular disease</z:e> and subsequent regression from the white matter injuries </plain></SENT>
