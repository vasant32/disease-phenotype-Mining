<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>307 AD patients, 168 VaD patients and 208 controls were compared on tests of cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results indicated that controls outperformed both patient groups (p &lt; 0.001) on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AD patients performed more poorly than VaD patients on 11 of the 18 cognitive tests (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Factor analysis of patient data indicated the existence of 3 factors generated from the battery of tests, relating to episodic memory, ECF and face recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was primarily on tests of ECF that the AD and VaD groups did not differ significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that ECF is a feature of cognition shared by the two pathologies, giving rise to an obligation to reconsider the current understanding of the core cognitive feature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
