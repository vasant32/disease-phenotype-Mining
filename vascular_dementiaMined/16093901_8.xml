<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The existing studies about the utility of P300 latency for diagnostically classifying patients in preclinical stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are cross-sectional rather than longitudinal in design, and their results are inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated the P300 value in a series of patients with subjective memory complaints using a prospective design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study was performed in a consecutive series of 116 outpatients with subjective memory complaints as the predominant symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>P300 (auditory oddball task) was performed immediately after the first clinical evaluation, and at 12 and 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Final cognitive syndrome diagnosis (mean follow-up period, 27.7 months) was then made by a neurologist who was blinded to the neurophysiologic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis at the end of follow-up was 30 cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognition, 30 cases of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, 28 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer's type (DAT), five cases of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and one case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo>; 22 patients were lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>P300 latency was significantly higher for the DAT group (analysis of variance: P=0.023) throughout the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic value of P300 latency at baseline examination for DAT had a sensitivity of 52.9% and a specificity of 76.9%; the odds ratio was 3.75 (95% confidence interval, 1.23-11.41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Findings from the present study suggest that assessment of evoked related potentials may contribute to the early detection of DAT </plain></SENT>
