<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>95 patients of senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (52 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), 43 with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD)) and 30 healthy subjects (control group) were underwent low-dose cerebral CTPI examinations with multi-slices spiral CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CTPI images were analyzed using perfusion software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Derived perfusion parameters including cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) and time to peak (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic value of perfusion parameters was evaluated by receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CBV and CBF of both of frontal lobe, temporal lobe, hippocampus and basal ganglial area in the patients with senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were much lower than those in the healthy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>And <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> of the areas above-mentioned in the senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> group were higher than those in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was statistically significant difference between them (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The areas under ROC curves of perfusion parameters left temporal lobe <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>, left the basal ganglia <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> and left the hippocampus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> to diagnose senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were 0.959, 0.920, 0.916, and diagnostic accuracy rate is higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The areas under ROC curve of the left frontal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>, the left basal ganglia CBV were 0.867 and 0.819, diagnosis accuracy medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results showed that cerebral CTPI is valuable for the diagnosis of senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
