<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The genetics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) are obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although most cases are <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> half the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> AD have a positive family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mode of genetic transmission and the role of environmental factors are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the contribution of genetic factors to the pathogenesis of AD in a twin cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Finnish Twin Cohort consists of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Finnish same-sexed twin pairs born before 1958 with both co-twins alive in 1975 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total number of twin pairs is 13 888, of whom 4307 are monozygotic (MZ) and 9581 ar dizygotic (DZ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data were linked with the Hospital Discharge Register from 1972 to 1991 to identify twins who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or related disease as a discharge diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The linkage of the registries yielded a total of 285 twin individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The medical records of these twins and their co-twins were reviewed to confirm and classify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence, concordance, and age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of AD were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: The incidence of AD was significantly higher in MZ than in DZ twin individuals, with and adjusted MZ/DZ incidence ratio of 1.8 (95% confidence intervals 1.2 to 2.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the incidence of vascular or mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> did not differ between MZ and DZ individuals (MZ/DZ ratio 0.6 [0.3 to 1.2]) for vascular and 1.0 [0.5 to 2.1] for mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The pairwise concordance for AD was 18.6% in MZ pairs and 4.7% in DZ pairs and the corresponding probandwise concordance rates were 31.3% and 9.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The pairwise concordance for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 18.2% in MZ pairs and 6.7% in DZ pairs with corresponding probandwise rates of 30.8% and 12.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age of AD concordant MZ pairs was identical in two pairs and diverged by up to 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: The higher incidence of AD in MZ individuals than in DZ individuals may provide a clue to the aetiology of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The higher concordance rate of MZ pairs confirms the contribution of the major genetic component while indicating the need to identify environmental triggers </plain></SENT>
