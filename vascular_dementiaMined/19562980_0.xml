<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was an analysis of previous study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tolerability and safety profile were analyzed according to sex, age, body weight, Thai mental state examination (TMSE) score, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) score, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> cooperative study/activities of daily living (ADCS/ADL) score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common adverse events were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, dizziness, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> which more often occurred during the dose-escalation phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean body weight lost at week 24 was 0.9 kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sex, age, body weight, and ADAS-cog score did not influence the incidence of any adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dizziness was more likely to occur in patients with low TMSE and high ADCS/ADL score (p = 0.02 and p = 0.050, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with TMSE score equal or higher than 23 more often experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003394'>muscle cramps</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> than who had TMSE lower 23 (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, flexible dose escalation of galantamine with a 4-week schedule was safe and well tolerated in Thai AD patients </plain></SENT>
