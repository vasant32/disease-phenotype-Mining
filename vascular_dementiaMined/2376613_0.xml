<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diffuse PVH was classified into two groups according to severity, group A (more severe) and group B (less severe); their <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> was classified into three stages, stage 1 (mildly impaired) through stage 3 (severely impaired) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>rCBF was assessed by single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The result showed that 6 of 7 MRI-group A patients were stage 3, but the stages of 19 group B patients varied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five of 7 MRI-group A patients showed severe hypoperfusion, but rCBF of group B patients also varied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients had a hypertensive history, but only 10 patients complained of cerebrovascular incidents before admission </plain></SENT>
