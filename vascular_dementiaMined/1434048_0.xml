<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular disorders including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are still among the most frequent diseases in the Japanese elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For treatment of hypertensive patients with or without a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, slight decrease of blood pressure (BP) is recommended since recent PET studies have revealed that an excessive drop of BP markedly decreases cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 24-hour-monitoring of BP revealed that physiological fluctuation of BP consisting of high daytime BP and low nocturnal BP disappears in hypertensive patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and those with non-symptomatic vascular lesions on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recommendable BP levels for the hypertensive elderly must be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of both aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> for prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recent multi-centric trials have revealed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> is more effective in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> but has more dangerous adverse effects than aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aspirin is reported to improve both the intellectual scale and cerebral blood flow in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recently selective <z:chebi fb="3" ids="25375">monoamine</z:chebi> oxidase (MAO) B inhibitors have been used in order to slow clinical progression of the disease, in addition to an attempt to increase the potential of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> through inhibition of MAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neural transplants to the striatum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> were first applied using autografts of the adrenal medulla in 1985, but resulted in transient or only slight improvements.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
