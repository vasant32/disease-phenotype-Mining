<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that freehand human-figure drawing (HFD), can be used as a complementary screening instrument to differentiate between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> elderly people and healthy elderly controls in population based studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: HFD was examined in 668 elderly ( &gt; or = 75 years of age) participants from an epidemiological study in Stockholm, who were asked to draw a human figure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The drawings were analysed on the content of body details and structural characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULT: The results show quite clearly that the body details and the height decrease with decreasing cognitive function, whereas the centredness (the distance in cm from the centre of the figure to the centre of the paper) increases with decreasing cognitive functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Demented</z:e> people place their figures in the upper left corner of the sheet, compared with the mostly well centred figures of non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age, on the other hand, has an influence on the HFD as after 90 years of age most of the variables show regressive changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The HFD can help to differentiate between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> subjects as well as between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of different severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The HFD does not help us, however, to discriminate between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age has an influence on the HFD in the sense that after 90 years most of the variables regress to a smaller or more primitive form </plain></SENT>
