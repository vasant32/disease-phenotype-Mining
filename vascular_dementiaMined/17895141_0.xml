<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VAD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer type (DAT) are malignant conditions of the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More information is required to clarify expected lengths of survival, which condition is more lethal, and which risk factors may influence survival duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cross-sectional and longitudinal designs were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival interval was the period after study admission to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From a population of 392 patients (of the 150 patients with VAD, mean age at entry was 68.3 years, of the 242 patients with DAT, mean age at entry was 73.0 years), there were 52 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, 26 patients with VAD and 26 patients with DAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre-entry <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> symptoms were present for a mean of 3.1 years, with median follow-up of 3.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 236 control subjects, there were 19 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Entry age was 69.5 years, with median follow-up of 8.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Influences of risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and body mass index on symptom duration, survival intervals, and cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e>, principally DAT, negatively influenced DAT survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Body mass index declined with age and duration of pre-entry symptoms among men and women in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Before entry, for men, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> symptoms were present for shorter periods compared with women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After entry, VAD and DAT patients had similar survival intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were similarly distributed (78% of patients with VAD died from vascular causes, 56% of patients with DAT and 67% of the controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: VAD and DAT are malignant conditions negatively influencing survival times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Being a woman seems to play a protective role in symptom duration before diagnosis, but after diagnosis survival times of men and women were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We attribute equivalence of survival intervals among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups to control of risk factors for cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
