<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>I devised the convenient semiquantitative measurement method of cerebral blood flow using single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computerized tomography (SPECT) and adapted clinically the method to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SPECT imaging utilized the tracer N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-[I-123] <z:chebi fb="0" ids="43448">iodo</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>) and 99mTc-hexamethyl-propyleneamineoxime (HMPAO) with a relative measure of regional tracer uptake normalized to cerebellar radiotracer uptake (rCBF ratios) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate relationships between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and cerebral blood flow, I studied 34 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 20 control subjects by the semiquantitative measurements of relative regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study I set the lower most <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rCBF ratio (NFL) in <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-SPECT and HMPAO-SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These NFL of <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-SPECT were higher than those NFL of HMPAO-SPECT in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cerebral cortices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NFL of <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-SPECT were nearer to PET's than NFL of HMPAO-SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>I indicated rCBF ratio in each region of cerebrum by distinguishing color of SPECT image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, while <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-SPECT imaging showed the reduction of rCBF ratio in both of frontal lobes and temporal lobes, HMPAO-SPECT imaging indicated several groups which showed no reduction in temporal lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This difference may be due to the lower detection rate of ischemic change in HMPAO-SPECT than <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-SPECT and it was consistent with many of other reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This result may suggest usefulness of this method </plain></SENT>
