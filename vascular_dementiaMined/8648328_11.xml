<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in an elderly rural population and to determine the effects of age, sex, and education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To obtain prevalence estimates of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> a door to door two phase population survey was carried out in three rural villages in central Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 1147 inhabitants older than 64, 968 (84.4%) completed the protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence rates (cases per 100 population over 64) were 8.0 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 27.3 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence rate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> did not differ between men and women (7.9 v 8.2), but increased with age (from 1.1 at age 65-69 to 34.8 at age 90-96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects with less than three years of schooling had a significantly higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (14.6; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 10.2-19.1) than subjects with three or more years of schooling (5.9; 95% CI 4.2-7.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the multivariate logistic analysis, the risk related with a low level of education was still present after adjustment for age and sex (OR = 2.0; 95% CI 1.2-3.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> was diagnosed in 64% of the 78 demented patients, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in 27%, and other dementing diseases in 9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In both Alzheimer and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtypes, the prevalence rates did not differ between men and women, but increased with age and were higher in subjects with a low level of education </plain></SENT>
