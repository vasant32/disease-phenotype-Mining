<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several animal studies have suggested that the cholinergic system in the hippocampus is involved in the control of the plasma level of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The stimulation of the hippocampal cholinergic system has resulted in the elevation of plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we measured the plasma level of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and insulin during a fasting state in the morning in hospitalized DAT (n=66), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) (n=28), or non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> (ND) (n=21) females (mean age DAT=82 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>49+/-4.98, VD=82.86+/-5.86, ND=82.95+/-7.77, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis showed that the plasma level of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> during a fasting state in DAT subjects was significantly lower than that of ND subjects; however, in VD subjects the level of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> was not different from that of ND subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other values did not differ significantly among the groups </plain></SENT>
