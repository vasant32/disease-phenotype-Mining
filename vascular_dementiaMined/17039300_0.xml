<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Few studies exist on ERPs and patients with subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (SVCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This latter is a quite homogeneous subtype of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> whose cognitive profile is quite different from that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The present study aims at comparing the ERPs profile both in patients with SVCI and in patients with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: ERPs and psychometric tests were collected from 39 healthy elderly controls, 51 patients with SVCI and 43 patients with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects mentally count high pitched target tones that were randomly intermixed with low pitched frequent tones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We measured ERPs latencies (N1, P2, N2 and P3), and interpeak latencies (N1-P3, N1-P2, N1<z:chebi fb="31" ids="30226">-N2</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Grand averaged potentials in SVCI showed a significant increase of P3 latency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AD patients showed a prolongation of N1, P2, N2, P3 latencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As far as interpeak latencies are concerned, SVCI patients showed a significant prolongation of N1-P3, AD patients had a significant increase of N1<z:chebi fb="31" ids="30226">-N2</z:chebi>, and N1-P3 intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were considered as a single group, correlation of neuropsychological tests scores showed a significant negative relationship between P300 latency and, respectively, Mini Mental Status Examination, auditive and visual span forward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In both groups, ERPs latency sensitivity, was low, whilst specificity values were quite high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our finding suggest that these two dementing diseases have different electrophysiologic features that may be related to their specific underlying pathogenetic mechanism; in particular, we hypothesise that, differently from AD, P300 latency prolongation characterizes the early stage of SVCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>So, this ERPs approach could be helpful to detect early alterations of the attentional/working-memory functions in patients with subcortical ischaemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
