<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have examined the levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), beta-endorphine (BEND), delta sleep-inducing <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (DSIP), somatostatin (SRIF), and neuropeptide Y (NPY) in CSF samples obtained under highly standardized conditions from healthy aged controls and from patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The influence of some potentially confounding factors was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CRH and BEND were markedly decreased in both AD and VAD patients, and BEND levels correlated negatively with degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> within the patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SRIF was decreased in both AD and VAD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DSIP was slightly increased in AD, but not in VAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NPY did not differ between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For none of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> did CSF concentrations correlate significantly with duration of illness, nor, with the exception of BEND, with its degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Present data do not support the hypothesis that specific neuropeptide changes occur in different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e>, but are in agreement with previous reports suggesting that neuropeptide systems are differentially affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
