<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This ambiguity may be related to factors such as the age and gender of subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the objective of this study was to calculate the relative frequencies of AD, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBD</z:e>, VaD, FTD, and HS among 382 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> from the State of Florida Brain Bank and to study the effect of age and gender on these frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AD was the most frequent pathologic finding (77%), followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBD</z:e> (26%), VaD (18%), HS (13%), and FTD (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mixed pathology was common: Concomitant AD was present in 66% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBD</z:e> patients, 77% of VaD patients, and 66% of HS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relative frequency of VaD increased with age, whereas the relative frequencies of FTD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBD</z:e> declined with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Males were overrepresented among those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBD</z:e>, whereas females were overrepresented among AD subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age over 70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These estimates of the a priori probabilities of dementing disorders have implications for clinicians and researchers </plain></SENT>
