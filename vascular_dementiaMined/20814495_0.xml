<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether learning and serial position effect (SPE) differs qualitatively and quantitatively among different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients and controls; we also wished to find out whether interference affects it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We administered the Malayalam version of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) to 30 cognitively unimpaired controls and 80 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients [30 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), 30 with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), and 20 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (FTD)] with mild severity on the Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> groups were comparable on education and age, except the FTD group, who were younger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Qualitatively, the learning pattern and SPE (with primacy and recency being superior to intermediate) was retained in the AD, VaD, and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On SPE in free recall, recency was superior to intermediate in the FTD group (P &lt; 0.01 using Bonferroni correction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On recognition, the AD and VaD groups had more misses (P &lt; 0.01), while the FTD group had more false positives (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Quantitative learning is affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pattern of qualitative learning remains unaltered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the early stages </plain></SENT>
