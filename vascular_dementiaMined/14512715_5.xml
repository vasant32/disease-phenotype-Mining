<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) share the same risk factors in Taiwan Chinese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using the criteria of the NINCDS- ADRDA and NINDS-AIREN, 154 AD patients, 30 VaD patients, and 112 controls were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (ApoE) genes, extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes, were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The epsilon4 allele frequency was significantly higher in AD patients than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio of carrying at least one copy of the epsilon4 allele in AD patients is 2.7 compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the VaD patients and the control subjects in their ApoE epsilon4 or epsilon2 allele frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrates a strong association between the ApoE epsilon4 allele and AD, but not between the ApoE epsilon4 allele and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that AD and VaD do not share the same pathogenesis and deserve further investigation </plain></SENT>
