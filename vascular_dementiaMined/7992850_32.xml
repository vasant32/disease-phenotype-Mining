<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To address both the disease and the allele specificity of this association, we have examined the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E allele distribution in 255 elderly persons including those with autopsy-confirmed AD, senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Lewy body type (SDLT), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington's disease</z:e> and in nondemented controls either with or without coronary complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The epsilon 4 allele frequency was increased in SDLT (0.365) and AD (0.328) as compared with controls (0.147), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> (0.098), or Huntington's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> (0.171) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>Coronary disease</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were associated with marginally higher epsilon 4 allele frequencies than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>, amyloid beta-protein accumulated to a greater extent in those cases possessing an epsilon 4 allele than in those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were not distinguished from either controls or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> cases without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, whether tested biochemically or by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is the comparison of the results in AD and SDLT that yielded the most significant findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a 1.8-fold excess of amyloid beta-protein in AD as compared with controls, and the levels in SDLT were intermediate between those in AD and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, AD was discriminated from both controls and SDLT by the substantial accumulation of paired helical filament tau and phosphorylated tau (both increased more than 20-fold as compared with controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SDLT was nevertheless characterized by an increased epsilon 4 allele frequency in the absence of significant tau pathology (at least 10-fold less than that in AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that tau processing is more specifically associated with AD than is amyloid beta-protein accumulation and that presence of the epsilon 4 allele is not an etiological factor that accounts for tau pathology </plain></SENT>
