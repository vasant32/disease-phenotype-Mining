<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five simple tests were analysed, i.e. verbal recall and recognition memory, object naming, word fluency and clock reading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pairwise discriminant analyses classified 79-83% of the cases correctly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MD) patients showed lower word fluency; otherwise, their profile was indistinguishable from AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recognition memory and clock reading were identified as predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> vs. AD diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The potential of single variables to distinguish the groups was tested by receiver operator characteristic curve analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A clock reading cut-off score close to maximum separated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> from AD and MD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recognition memory separated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> from AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results show that neuropsychological tests can distinguish <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> and MD from AD with high sensitivity (88-94%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Due to the overlapping of scores and a higher prevalence of AD, specificity was moderate (65-76%) and positive predictive values were low, whereas sensitivity and negative predictive indices were high </plain></SENT>
