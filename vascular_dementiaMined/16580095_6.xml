<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 110 autopsy cases and reported sensitivities and specificities of the State of California <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Diagnostic and Treatment Centers (ADDTC) and National Institute for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> (NINDS-AIREN) criteria for possible VaD as well as Hachinski ischemic score (HIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among them, there were 36 neuropathologically confirmed VaD cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> criteria displayed comparable sensitivities (0.56-0.58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specificities values were 0.74, 0.73 and 0.66, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was an age-related decrease on ADDTC criteria sensitivity due to the fact that 42% of pure VaD cases did not present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty percent of mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MD) cases were diagnosed as VaD by both NINDS-AIREN and ADDTC criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This proportion reached 45.9% for the HIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that the new diagnostic criteria for possible VaD do not provide a substantial gain of sensitivity compared to the HIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although their specificity was significantly lower in this age group compared to younger cohorts, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them successfully exclude AD cases </plain></SENT>
