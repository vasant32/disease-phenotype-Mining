<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM OF THE STUDY: In this report, we investigated the effects of ginsenoside Rg2 on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion induced impairment of neurological responses, memory and caudate-putamen neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Neurological evaluation was performed 24h after reperfusion and Y-maze memory performance was assessed at 48 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemical techniques were employed to check the protein expression of BCL-2, BAX, heat shock protein 70 and P53, which are related with cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neurological responses and memory ability of the ginsenoside Rg2 or nimodipine groups improved significantly compared with the VD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of BCL-2 and HSP70 were decreased, while BAX and P53 were increased in the VD model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of BCL-2 and HSP70 proteins were increased, while BAX and P53 decreased after ginsenoside Rg2 (2.5, 5 and 10mg/kg) and nimodipine (50 microg/kg) treatment compared with the VD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study suggests that ginsenoside Rg2 improved neurological performance and memory ability of VD rats through mechanisms related to anti-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The capacity for ginsenoside Rg2 to modulate the expression of apoptotic related proteins suggests that ginsenoside Rg2 may represent a potential treatment strategy for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or other ischemic insults </plain></SENT>
