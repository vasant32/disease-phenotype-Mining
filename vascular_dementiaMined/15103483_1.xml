<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: In an outpatient memory clinic, the methods of extended clinical diagnostics pertaining to imaging and neuropsychology were changed but the modus of assignment to the clinic remained unchanged at different times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Expected changes in the diagnostic spectrum can be attributed to the changed diagnostics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consistent with reports from the literature regarding the consequences of such changes, the associated costs have to be taken into consideration as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical final diagnoses of 174 patients referred in 2000/2001 for the diagnostics and differential diagnostics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> ("current population") were compared with those of 169 patients who visited the same outpatient clinic in 1998/1999 ("former population") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic spectra of the two populations were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnoses were differentiated in "no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>" (XD), "neurodegenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>" (ND), "vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>" (VD), and "<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the mixed type" (MIXD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, the same clinical diagnostic criteria (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10) and laboratory tests were implemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only the neuroradiological and neuropsychological methods changed from 1998/1999 to 2000/2001: The current population was examined with MRI instead of CT and underwent an expanded neuropsychological test battery with additional power and speed tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The diagnoses of the two populations differed significantly in their frequency distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was excluded in 51.1% of the "current" patients vs 19.5% of the "former" patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnoses were significantly different for the diagnoses ND (29.9 vs 47.9%) and MIXD (1.1 vs 7.7%), but not for VD (13.2 vs 12.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Beside other independent modalities, the improvement of imaging with MRI is discussed as recording <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> size and vascular lesions better than CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The improvement of the neuropsychological test battery containing additional speed tests is discussed as being able to differentiate even minimal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disturbances</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Using optimized imaging and neuropsychological methods, the diagnostic spectrum of an outpatient memory clinic changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The clinical diagnosis was improved by the more sensitive, extended clinical diagnostics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Through optimized differential diagnostic allocation and the exclusion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, expenses can be reduced by early and indication-related medication and by the resulting delay of institutionalized care </plain></SENT>
