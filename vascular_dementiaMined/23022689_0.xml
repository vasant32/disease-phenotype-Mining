<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM OF THE STUDY: Based on previous work, we intended to investigate the protective effects of LIG on parietal cortex and hippocampus of rats in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> was induced by permanent, bilateral common carotid artery's occlusion (2VO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats were treated with LIG (80mg/kg, by oral) from the eighth day after surgery for seven consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their spatial learning and memory abilities were assessed using the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After six days for maze test, rats were sacrificed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Coronal sections in cortex and hippocampus were stained with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi> or labeled with NeuN (Neuronal Nuclei), MAP-2 (Microtubule-Associated Protein-2), Caspase-3 and GFAP (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LIG treatment for seven days decreased escape latency and swimming distance of 2VO rats from the third day in maze tests, and increased percent time in the target quadrant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LIG prevented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo>, dendrites damage and neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in both parietal cortex and hippocampus of 2VO rats; and it also inhibited astrocytic activation and proliferation stimulated by hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that LIG show obvious neuroprotective potential for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> injury, which may be attributed to its anti-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of neuron and anti-proliferation of astrocyte both in cortex and in hippocampus of 2VO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We suggest that LIG can be developed as an effective drugs for the prevention of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) </plain></SENT>
