<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Very little information on the effects of Chinese medicines on GH and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> is available in the literature published in English </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the effects of a Chinese medicine suppository, Vigconic VI-28 (VI-28), consisting of concentrated extracts of a composite mixture of herbal materials, on serum IGF-1 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vivo observations after treatment with Chinese medicines have often indicated changes in biochemical profiles of measurable parameters related to those changes in <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> secretions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty six healthy males (age 47-66) were under observation over a 16-week schedule after using VI-28 suppository from 0 to 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood specimens were taken monthly (except at the end of week 8) for analysis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> and IGF-1 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with week 0, IGF-1 levels (192.5 +/- 66.4 ng/ml) were significantly elevated at week 4 (211.7 +/- 80.5, p &lt; 0.05) and week 12 (226.6 +/- 95.2 ng/ml, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant changes were observed for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> for the whole cohort from week 0 to week 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When the cohort was divided into 2 groups using a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> level of 13.0 micro mol/l as the cut-off, a significant (p &lt; 0.05) difference in IGF-1 was observed between the 2 groups at week 12 only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean IGF-1 of 14 subjects with higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> levels was lower than that of the 22 subjects with lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We believe that VI-28 may exert a regulatory effect on the relationship between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> and IGF-1, at least in subjects with relatively low levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, we also observed an apparent association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi>&gt; or =13.0 micromol/l) with decreased IGF-1 </plain></SENT>
