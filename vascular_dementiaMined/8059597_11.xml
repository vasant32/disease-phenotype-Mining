<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878486" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Arteriolosclerosis</z:e> in the white matter is a common feature in these white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate a possible alteration of the distribution of amyloid precursor protein (APP), chromogranin A (CgA) and synaptophysin (Syn) in such white matter lesions, we examined 15 cases with white matter lesions and 5 without white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many bundles of axons with APP-like immunoreactivity (LI) were observed particularly in mild white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such bundles of axons showed similar but less intense CgA-LI and Syn-LI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They appeared to occur in areas with many ameboid or ramified microglia labeled with anti-leukocyte common antigen and few astrocytes labeled with anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the center of moderate of severe white matter lesions bundles of axons with APP-LI were never observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since APP, CgA and Syn undergo fast axonal transport, and since following ischemic insults to central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system microglial reaction occurs earlier than astroglial changes, our results suggest that axonal damage, which induces disturbance of fast axonal transport, can occur even in the early stage of white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
