<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The increase was mostly attributed to a higher rate of new cases among women than among men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The proportion of moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> increased, and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> decreased, mainly because of progression of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> to severer forms and because most new cases were of moderate to severe degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proportion of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 47% at age 85 and 54% at 88 despite a higher mortality in vascular than in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis changed to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in 9 out of 31 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> because of new cerebrovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study illustrates that prevalence is influenced by several factors, such as number of new cases, refusal rate, diagnostic change, and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These factors act in different directions and may differ between populations </plain></SENT>
