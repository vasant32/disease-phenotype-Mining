<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there are difficulties in accurately defining patients with VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials to assess the efficacy and tolerability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> in patients with VaD have been completed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Placebo-treated patients demonstrated stable cognitive and global function over the 24 weeks of the study </plain></SENT>
