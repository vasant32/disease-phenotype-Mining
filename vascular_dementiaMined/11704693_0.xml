<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> affects many body systems outside the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, we investigated gastrointestinal regulatory <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> as possible disease markers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects with mild-to-moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were diagnosed as probable AD and VaD according to defined criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gastrointestinal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were stimulated using a standardized meal test, administered after an overnight fast to 58 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients (40 AD, 18 VaD) and 47 controls matched for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were taken at designated time intervals, and basal and stimulated plasma concentrations of eleven <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were determined by radio-immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results were analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance; the Mann-Whitney U test was used in post hoc analysis where appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in somatostatin levels but in none of the other <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Basal somatostatin was significantly increased in VaD compared to controls (p&lt;0.05), and AD (p&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Maximum stimulated levels were significantly elevated in VaD compared to AD (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median basal and stimulated levels of somatostatin were increased in VaD compared to AD, but the overlap in individual values between the groups makes it unlikely to be useful in distinguishing the two types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
