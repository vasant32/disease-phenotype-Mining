<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nineteen individuals with mild VaD and 17 individuals with moderate VaD were administered the California Verbal Learning Test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both groups were impaired on a general memory measure, and the moderately impaired group demonstrated significantly poorer recall than the mildly impaired group on the first learning trial and on total learning across trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, individuals with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> demonstrated an intact primacy and recency effect, whereas individuals with moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> demonstrated neither primacy nor recency effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latter findings are consistent with studies examining the serial position effect in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> populations, and suggests that the absence of primacy and recency effects in more advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> may occur regardless of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> type </plain></SENT>
