<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency, risk factors for, and relevance of silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Framingham cohort of 5,184 men and women aged 30-62 years and free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at entry to the study have been followed with periodic examinations since 1950 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> found on computed tomography scan of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> that occurred between January 1, 1979, and July 31, 1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During these 8 1/2 years, 164 initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred; 124 had computed tomography scans performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 13 (10%) with silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 71 had abnormalities related to their presenting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and 40 had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> computed tomography scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 15 silent lesions; eight were lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the basal ganglia-internal capsule area, seven were small cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>Glucose intolerance</z:hpo> was the sole risk factor that occurred significantly more frequently (11 of 13) in the group with silent lesions (p less than 0.04) than in the group with computed tomography evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is not rare; it was present in at least 10% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients arising in a general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relation of these silent lesions to the development of "vascular" <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and poststroke disability deserves further study </plain></SENT>
