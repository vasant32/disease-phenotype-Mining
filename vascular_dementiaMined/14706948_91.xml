<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Abnormal hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau and its incorporation into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo> are major hallmarks of the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different tau phosphoepitopes can be sensitively detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of CSF concentrations of tau proteins phosphorylated at 3 pathophysiologically important <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> (p-tau) to discriminate among patients with AD, nondemented control subjects, and patients with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional, bicenter, memory clinic-based studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: One hundred sixty-one patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo>, or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 45 nondemented controls (N = 206) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Levels of tau protein phosphorylated at threonine 231 (p-tau231), threonine 181 (p-tau181), and serine 199 (p-tau199) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CSF p-tau protein levels were measured using 3 different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean CSF levels of the studied p-tau proteins were significantly elevated in patients with AD compared with the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Applied as single markers, p-tau231and p-tau181 reached specificity levels greater than 75% between AD and the combined non-AD group when sensitivity was set at 85% or greater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Statistical differences between the assay performances are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Particularly, discrimination between AD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> was maximized using p-tau181at a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 64%, and p-tau231 maximized group separation between AD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> with a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 92% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Combinations of the 3 markers did not add discriminative power compared with the application as single markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The p-tau proteins in CSF come closest to fulfilling the criteria of a biological marker of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There is a tendency for p-tau proteins to perform differently in the discrimination of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> disorders from AD </plain></SENT>
