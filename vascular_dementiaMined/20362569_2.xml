<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Permanent occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries (2VO) induced severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> tested by the water maze task, along with <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> in hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oral administration of osthole for 3 weeks markedly attenuated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> and neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biochemical experiments revealed that osthole decreased the production of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) and significantly increased the activities of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">Glutathione</z:chebi> Peroxidase (GPx) and Catalase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blot analyses indicated that osthole prevented the downregulation of bcl-2 expression and upregulation of bax expression, which resulted in decreasing bax/bcl-2 ratio in hippocampus of 2VO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, osthole effectively alleviated the activation of caspase-3 induced by permanent occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The observed results in present study suggest that osthole exhibits therapeutic potential for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, which is most likely related, at least in part, to its antioxidation and anti-apoptotic actions </plain></SENT>
