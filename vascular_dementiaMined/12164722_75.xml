<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Phosphorylation of tau protein at threonine 231 (using full-length tau, 441 amino acids, for the numbering scheme) (p-tau(231)) occurs specifically in postmortem brain tissue of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) and can be sensitively detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine to what extent CSF levels of p-tau(231) distinguish patients with AD from control subjects and from patients with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>, and to investigate whether p-tau(231) levels are a better diagnostic marker than levels of total tau protein (t-tau) in CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional, multicenter, memory clinic-based studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: One hundred ninety-two patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (FTD), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, Lewy body <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, or other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorder</z:e> and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Levels of CSF tau proteins as measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean CSF levels of p-tau(231) were significantly elevated in the AD group compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Levels of p-tau(231) did not correlate with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> severity in AD, and discriminated with a sensitivity of 90.2% and a specificity of 80.0% between AD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non-AD disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, p-tau(231) levels improved diagnostic accuracy compared with t-tau levels when patients with AD were compared with healthy controls (P =.03) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> subjects (P&lt;.001), particularly those with FTD (P&lt;.001), but not those with vascular and Lewy body <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity levels between AD and FTD were raised by p-tau(231) compared with t-tau levels from 57.7% to 90.2% at a specificity level of 92.3% for both markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Increased levels of CSF p-tau(231) may be a useful, clinically applicable biological marker for the differential diagnosis of AD, particularly for distinguishing AD from FTD </plain></SENT>
