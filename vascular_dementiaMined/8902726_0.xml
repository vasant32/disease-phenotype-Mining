<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Error counts on TT and NN tests were best fit by a negative binomial (overdispersed Poisson) distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TT, NN, and combined (TT + NN) error counts were regressed on patient characteristics (sex, age, and education), severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (Mini-Mental State Exam: MMSE), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> stage (Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating: CDR), etiology, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age, and symptom duration in a negative binomial generalized linear model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient characteristics, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age, and symptom duration had no significant effects on any error count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects of MMSE, CDR, and etiology, on the other hand, were highly significant and appear to help discriminate vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MMSE (which taps cognitive skills) correlated with both TT and NN errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CDR (which taps both cognitive and functional skills) correlated only with TT errors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> etiology correlated only with NN errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These distinct correlational patterns reflect differences between the TT and NN tasks (i.e., trail-tracing vs. number-naming) related to specific brain loci and associated functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This aspect of the phenomenon suggests that Ishihara tests have useful clinical applications in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
