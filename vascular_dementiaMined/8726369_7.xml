<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On reinstatement of the cue 1 day later, a substantial portion of the sample recalled the task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The teaching method, both with and without participant performance of the task (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53257">PPT</z:chebi>), was spaced retrieval with supplementary or fading cues provided as required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Findings were that (a) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53257">PPT</z:chebi> encoding and retrieval encoding, separately, assisted later recall: (b) retrieval combined with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53257">PPT</z:chebi> encoding increased the probability of task performance at final recall; (c) repetition in the absence of retrieval or <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53257">PPT</z:chebi> was less effective; and (d) there was no forgetting between 1 hr and 1 day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Theoretical and clinical aspects of these findings are discussed </plain></SENT>
