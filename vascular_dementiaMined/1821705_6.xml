<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Decreased concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (P less than 0.05) and homovanillic acid (P less than 0.01) were found, and increased arginine vasopressin- (P less than 0.01), galanin- (P less than 0.05) and somatostatin- (P less than 0.01) like immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that this disequilibrium may be important for certain circadian symptoms, e.g. the changes in sleep/wake rhythms that are rather often observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
