<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Four U.S. communities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Men and women (N=3,602) with a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan but no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were followed for 5.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Neurologists and psychiatrists classified incident cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and subtype using neuropsychological tests, examination, medical records and informant interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> was defined at the time of the MRI scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Noninvasive tests of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> were assessed within 1 year of the MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">Apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E allele status, age, race, sex, education, Mini-Mental State Examination score, and income were assessed as potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was higher in those with prevalent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, particularly in the subgroup with PAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rate of AD was 34.4 per 1,000 person-years for those with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, versus 22.2 per 1,000 person-years without a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> (adjusted hazard ratio (HR)=1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.0-1.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Rates of AD were highest in those with PAD (57.4 vs 23.7 per 100 person-years, adjusted HR=2.4, 95% CI=1.4-4.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Results were similar with further exclusion of those with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> from the AD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A gradient of increasing risk was noted with the extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Older adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had a higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and AD than did those without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The risk was highest in people with PAD, suggesting that extensive peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is a risk factor for AD </plain></SENT>
