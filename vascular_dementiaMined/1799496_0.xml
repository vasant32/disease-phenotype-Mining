<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects were 80 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (20 males, 60 females) whose mean age was 80.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> controls were 9 elderly subjects (2 males, 7 females) whose mean age was 80.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following parameters were measured: peak latencies (I, III and V), interpeak latencies (I-III, III-V and I-V) and interaural latency differences (V PLDs and I-V IPLDs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As for clinical items and sex differences; (1) There were sex differences recognized between peak latency of III and V, interpeak latency of III-V and I-V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(2) There was a significant difference in interaural differences of V PL Ds between vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer's type and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Duration of illness had no correlation with latencies of BAEPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dividing the patients into three groups according to the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> which are mild, moderate and severe, (3) peak latency of III, V and interpeak latency of I-III, III-V, I-V and interaural latency differences of V PL Ds prolonged significantly with the increasing severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From these results, it is suggested that brainstem dysfunction progresses with the increasing severity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
