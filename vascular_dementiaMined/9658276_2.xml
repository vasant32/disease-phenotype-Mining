<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: With the development of pharmacological treatments for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> there will be an increase in the numbers of patients requiring assessment from specialist services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="?"><plain>Could the role of the specialist clinician be supported by other health professionals screening those who might benefit from treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Sixty-four consecutive referrals to the Leicester University Memory Clinic were assessed at home by a community psychiatric nurse using a semi-structured interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The nurse then reported her findings to a psychiatrist and a diagnosis was agreed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This diagnosis was then compared to the Memory Clinic diagnosis and a standardized (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10) diagnosis recorded by another psychiatrist examining the clinic records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The nurse assessment procedure performed well in detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, with a kappa statistic (k) of 0.75 when compared to the standardized and Memory Clinic diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was, however, only moderate concordance between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10 diagnosis and nurse (k = 0.46) and the Memory Clinic and nurse (k = 0.60) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relatively low k value for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> was principally a result of difficult in differentiating vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A single supervised community psychiatric nurse, using a structured assessment instrument, can adequately detect early <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in a sample of patients referred with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory problems</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are not, however, accurately differentiated </plain></SENT>
