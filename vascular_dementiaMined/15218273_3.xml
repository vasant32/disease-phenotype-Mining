<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There are no data concerning the relative representation of clinical vascular risk factors and radiological lesions in cases that have been ruled in and ruled out for probable vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) according to NINDS-AIREN criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three months after their index <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, a psychiatrist interviewed patients and made a diagnosis of VaD according to both <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV and NINDS-AIREN criteria for probable VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients who fulfilled the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV criteria for VaD were divided into two groups: those who were ruled in and ruled out according to NINDS-AIREN criteria as probable VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic characteristics, vascular risk factors, clinical features of the index <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and radiological findings were then compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 297 patients screened, 56 (18.8%) had a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients, 55 (98.2%) and 22 (39.3%) fulfilled <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV and NINDS-AIREN diagnosis of VaD, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The concordance and level of agreement (kappa statistic) between <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV and NINDS-AIREN diagnoses were 40% and 0.02, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reasons of failure to meet NINDS-AIREN criteria included the lack of temporal relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n = 20), the absence of focal neurological signs and/or radiological evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n = 6) and both of the above (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the above two groups in terms of demographic data, features of index <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, vascular risk factors and CT scan findings, except that leukoaraiosis (p = 0.021) and bilateral lesions (p = 0.015) were more frequent in subjects diagnosed according to NINDS-AIREN criteria of probable VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The difference between these two groups with respect to the number of lesions was borderline for significance (p = 0.052) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of NINDS-AIREN criteria for VaD for case selection in poststroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> research may exclude a number of subjects with VaD </plain></SENT>
