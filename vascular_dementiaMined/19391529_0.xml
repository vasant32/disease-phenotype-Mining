<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and eighty cases of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were randomly divided into an auricular point taping and pressing group and a western medicine group, 90 cases in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The auricular point taping and pressing group was treated by auricular point taping and pressing at auricular points Shennen, Nao (brain), Shen (kidney), Zhen (pulvinal), and the western medicine group by oral administration of Nimodipine, thrice each day, 30 mg each time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were treated for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The scores of mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and activities of daily living (ADL), and adverse reaction were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The scores of MMSE before treatment and 12 weeks after treatment were 18.00 +/- 3.88 and 20.83 +/- 3.74 in the auricular point taping and pressing group, and 17.80 +/- 3.82 and 20.70 +/- 3.53 in the western medicine group, respectively, with significant increases in scores of MMSE after treatment in the two groups (both P &lt; 0.01) and with no significant difference between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The scores of ADL before treatment and 12 weeks after treatment were 44.90 +/- 14.84 and 39.60 +/- 12.45 in the auricular point taping and pressing group, and 45.70 +/- 14.86 and 39.10 +/- 13.44 in the western medicine group, respectively, with significant decreases after treatment in the two groups (both P &lt; 0.01) and with no significant difference between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the auricular point taping and pressing group, 2 cases withdrew from the test because adhesive plaster allergic reaction induced severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">itch</z:e> of the auricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the western medicine group, one case had mild dizziness and another case had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Auricular point taping and pressing and Nimodipine have similar therapeutic effect on vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and have no obvious adverse reaction, except adhesive plaster allergic reaction </plain></SENT>
