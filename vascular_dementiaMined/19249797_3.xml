<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vascular risk factors are important in the genesis of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> but underlying mechanisms need further exploration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this respect, asymptomatic spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> (SCE) may be of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such emboli are common in patients at risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, for example those with symptomatic or severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e>, and predict the future risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we summarise our research which shows that asymptomatic SCE may be involved in the aetiology, symptomatology and progression of both AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In just 1 h of transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring SCE were detected in 40% of AD and 37% of VaD patients compared to 15% and 14% of their respective controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio for SCE was 2.70 (1.18-6.21) for AD and 5.36 (1.24-23.18) for VaD, adjusted for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of SCE was associated with the concurrent presence of clinically relevant depressive symptoms and the future rapid rates of decline in cognition and daily function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SCE may represent a potentially treatable target to slow and possibly prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, both AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
