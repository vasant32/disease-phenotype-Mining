<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The commonly used International Workshop of the National Institute of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> (NINDS) and the Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (AIREN) criteria for VaD necessitate evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> on CT or MRI of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purposes of our study were to operationalize the radiological part of the NINDS-AIREN criteria and to assess the effect of this operationalization on interobserver agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six experienced and 4 inexperienced observers rated a set of 40 MRI studies of patients with clinically suspected VaD twice using the NINDS-AIREN set of radiological criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the first reading session, operational definitions were conceived, which were subsequently used in the second reading session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interobserver reproducibility was measured by Cohen's kappa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall agreement at the first reading session was poor (kappa=0.29) and improved slightly after application of the additional definitions (kappa=0.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Raters in the experienced group improved their agreement from almost moderate (kappa=0.39) to good (0.62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The inexperienced group started out with poor agreement (kappa=0.17) and did not improve (kappa=0.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The experienced group improved in both the large- and small-vessel categories, whereas the inexperienced group improved generally in the extensive white matter hyperintensities categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Considerable interobserver variability exists for the assessment of the radiological part of the NINDS-AIREN criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Use of operational definitions improves agreement but only for already experienced observers </plain></SENT>
