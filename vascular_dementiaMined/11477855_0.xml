<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-six cases of VaD were randomly divided into two groups, the electroacupuncture group (EA group) and the acupuncture group (AP group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Assessment of Hasgawa's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> scale (HDS), functional activities questionnaire (FAQ) and neurologic deficit scoring were done before and after treatment, and the changes on SOD, LPO and NO levels were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After treatment, in the EA group, the HDS elevated, the FAQ lowered, SOD increased and LPO and NO decreased significantly, as compared with before treatment, P &lt; 0.01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>But these parameters were not changed significantly in the AP group after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical symptoms were improved in both groups, but the reduction on neurologic deficit score was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total effective rate of the EA group was higher than that of the AP group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The immediate effect of electroacupuncture was superior to that of acupuncture, suggesting that the electroacupuncture was more effective in promoting the intelligence recovery than acupuncture </plain></SENT>
