<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the validity of a clinical diagnosis of probable or possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>) made using International Consensus criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Validation studies based on retrospective chart reviews of autopsy-confirmed cases have suggested that diagnostic specificity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> is acceptable but case detection rates as low as 0.22 have been suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated the first 50 cases reaching neuropathologic autopsy in a cohort to which Consensus clinical diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>, National Institute for Neurological and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009460" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Communicative Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> and Related Disorders Association criteria for AD, and National Institute of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences criteria for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) had been prospectively applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-six clinical diagnoses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>, 19 of AD, and 5 of VaD were made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At autopsy, 29 DLB cases, 15 AD, 5 VaD, and 1 progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270920" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">supranuclear palsy</z:e> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of a clinical diagnosis of probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> in this sample were 0.83 and 0.95 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the five cases receiving a false-negative diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>, significant fluctuation was present in four but <z:hpo ids='HP_0002367'>visual hallucinations</z:hpo> and spontaneous motor features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> were generally absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one percent of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> cases had additional vascular pathology and in two cases this contributed to a misdiagnosis of VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No correlations were found between the distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> and clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Consensus criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> performed as well in this prospective study as those for AD and VaD, with a diagnostic sensitivity substantially higher than that reported by previous retrospective studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> occurs in the absence of extrapyramidal features and in the presence of comorbid cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fluctuation is an important diagnostic indicator, reliable measures of which need to be developed further </plain></SENT>
