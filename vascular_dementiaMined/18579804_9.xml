<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> can be divided into those that lead to pathologic insults and those that render the brain more vulnerable to such insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> prevention strategies need to be informed as to whether to prioritize reducing risk of pathology or to reduce the vulnerability of the brain to pathologic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lower premorbid cognitive ability is associated with both increased vascular risk and reduced cognitive reserve, a measure of brain vulnerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated differential effects of premorbid cognitive ability on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtypes to clarify which causal pathway was predominant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 297 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were identified from local case registers, born in 1921, and thus may have participated in the Scottish Mental Survey of 1932 (SMS1932) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 183 had mental ability scores identified in the SMS1932 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 173 of these were matched by birth records to one set of controls (controls1) by date of birth, sex, and district of birth registration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A further set of controls (controls2) was generated additionally matched on paternal occupation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases had significantly lower premorbid cognitive ability (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41-0.94, for every 10-point increase [0.7 SD] in mental ability score vs controls2), but there was no significant difference in the premorbid cognitive ability of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> cases (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.82-1.28) vs controls2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Lower premorbid cognitive ability is a risk factor for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This suggests its effect acts mainly through vascular pathology rather than brain vulnerability </plain></SENT>
