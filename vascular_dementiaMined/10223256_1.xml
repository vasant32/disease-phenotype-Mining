<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) are the two most common age-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychologic studies have demonstrated visuoconstructional impairment in AD and in VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study used the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure to assess and compare specific aspects of visuoconstructional deficits in patients with AD, patients with VaD, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> age-matched subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Thirteen <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, 20 patients with AD, and 20 patients with VaD were given a neuropsychologic battery as part of a comprehensive evaluation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The groups were similar in age and education, and the VaD and AD groups had comparable levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on their previous research on visual deficits in AD, the authors devised a new scoring system that divided the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure into six perceptual categories: right, left, upper, lower, basic gestalt, and inner detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with AD and patients with VaD had significant deficits in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure scoring categories compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with AD exhibited a pattern of deficits similar to that of patients with VaD, with one significant exception: The patients with AD had increased left-sided errors or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0424101" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">inattention</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that left hemispatial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0424101" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">inattention</z:e> contributes to impaired performance on visuoconstructional tasks in AD </plain></SENT>
