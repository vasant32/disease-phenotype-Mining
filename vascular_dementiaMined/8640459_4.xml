<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The learning and memory performance was tested by a step-through passive avoidance task and an 8-arm radial maze task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Permanent 2ICAO decreased cerebral blood flows in the cortex and hippocampus by 46.3 +/- 3.3 and 21.1 +/- 4.6%, respectively, when measured at 15 min after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the passive avoidance task, the 2ICAO rats showed no impairment of learning or of memory retention when tested 1 h after learning trial, while they showed a shorter latency than sham-operated rats when tested 24 h after learning trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the radial maze learning task, the non-pretrained 2ICAO rats showed impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pretrained 2ICAO rats had no deficit in the radial maze retention task but they showed impaired performance when a 3-min delay was interposed in the task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that permanent 2ICAO is a useful animal model for studying vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
