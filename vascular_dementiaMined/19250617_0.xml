<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pain in patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> whose verbal fluency is declining is underestimated and poorly treated and this is mainly due to the lack of availability of proper tools able to recognise and to assess this disease symptom in those patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During recent years major progress has taken place, and valid scales that allow for the assessment of the pain also in those kind of patients have been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this research is to verify the pertinence of the PAINAD and ABBEY scales throughout the assessment of pain in a 30 resident patients in care of a geriatric setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The thirty elderly were average age 86 years (18 female and 12 male) with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or late stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, completely dependant on ADLs and with global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 48 hours from the acceptance to hospital the pain has been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pain assessment was carried out by administering the PAINAD (already validate in italian) and ABBEY scales by the nurse responsible for the patient and by a second nurse, for an amount of four surveys for each patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results show that both scales give equivalent results for the pain assessment (K=0.68), with concordance asset moderately good between the exams taken by the two nurses (Cohen K rate between 0.49 and 0.58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The PAINAD scale requires an administering time far lower than the ABBEY scale (p 0.001) and both can be used for the assessment of pain in those patients, also in the hospital </plain></SENT>
