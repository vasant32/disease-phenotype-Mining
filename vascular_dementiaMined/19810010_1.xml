<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with AD (n = 76) and VaD (n = 46) were recruited from a memory clinic along with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> free participants (n = 28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They underwent specific tests of working memory from the Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) battery and pen and paper tests of executive function including CLOX 1 &amp; 2, EXIT25 and a test of verbal fluency (COWAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a CT brain scan which was independently scored for white matter change/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The AD and VaD groups were significantly impaired on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measures of working memory and executive functioning compared to the disease free group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the AD and VaD groups on any measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Z-scores confirmed the pattern of impairment in executive functioning and working memory was largely equivalent in both patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Small to moderate correlations were seen between the MMSE and the neurocognitive scores in both patient groups and the pattern of correlations was also very similar in both patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates sizeable executive functioning and working <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairments</z:hpo> in patients with mild-moderate AD and VaD but no significant differences between the disease groups </plain></SENT>
