<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of moxibustion therapy on the improvements of clinical symptom scale score and neuropeptide substance in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) and investigate a part of mechanism of moxibustion on Vd </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-seven cases of VD were divided randomly into a moxibustion group (43 cases) and a western medicine group (44 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In moxibustion group, the isolated moxibustion with Typhonium Rhizome was applied to Baihui (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> 20), and suspended moxibustion was used on Shenting (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> 24) and Dazhui (GV 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In western medicine group, Piracetam tablet was taken orally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 4-session treatment, the scores in Hasegawa's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Scale (HDS), Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and Activity of Daily Living Scale (ADL) as well as the content of active substances, somatostatin (SS) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) in cerebral spinal fluid relevant with learning and memory were compared with those before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total effective rate was 81.4% (35/43) in moxibustion group, which was superior to 63.6% (28/44) in western medicine group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The scores in HDS, MMSE and ADL after treatment were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> improved as compared with those before treatment in two groups (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The improvements of the scores in MMSE and ADL in moxibustion group were superior to those in western medicine group (both P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After treatment, SS and AVP content in cerebral spinal fluid increased remarkably as compared with those before treatment in two groups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.01), and SS and AVP levels after treatment in moxibustion group were improved significantly as compared with those in western medicine group (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Moxibustion therapy is superior to oral administration of western medicine no matter in the improvement of symptom scores or in the regulation of neuropeptide substances relevant with learning and memory, which deserves to be promoted in application </plain></SENT>
