<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To explore the factors affecting time to institutionalisation and estimate the relationship between the costs of care and disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Retrospective analysis of a longitudinal data-set for a cohort of 100 patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Changes in both Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Barthel scores have independent and significant marginal effects on costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each one-point decline in the MMSE score is associated with a pound sterling 56 increase in the four-monthly costs, whereas each one-point fall in the Barthel index is associated with a pound sterling 586 increase in costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It may be inappropriate for economic models of disease progression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> to be based solely on measures of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1392786" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive change</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MMSE and the Barthel index are independent significant predictors of time to institutionalisation and cost of care, but changes in the Barthel index are particularly important in predicting costs outside institutional care </plain></SENT>
