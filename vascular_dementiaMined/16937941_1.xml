<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: There are few longitudinal studies on the subjective quality of life for elderly persons living in their own homes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to clarify the validity and reliability of the Japanese version of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Quality of Life Scale (JDQoL) used in a follow-up survey as part of a longitudinal study in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A baseline study was conducted from November 2002 to January 2003, and a year later a follow-up study was conducted from October 2003 to January 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjects included 72 (19 men and 53 women) elderly persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> living in their own homes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-six were diagnosed with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) and 6 had senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer's type (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The follow-up study included 60 subjects (VD: 56 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e>: 4); _10 of the original subjects were hospitalized, one died, and one was unable to attend daycare because of deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evaluation was conducted using the JDQoL, MiniMental State Examination (MMSE), and Geriatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale (GDS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For the MMSE, the average score of the subjects in the follow-up study was 20.87 (+/- 4.80), which was significantly higher than the score of subjects that were excluded from the follow-up study (17.82 +/- 5.65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At baseline, reliability coefficient was demonstrated by Cronbach's alpha value of 0.744 approximately 0.886 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One year later, Cronbach's alpha was 0.723 approximately 0.872 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the subjects in the follow-up study, MMSE scores decreased significantly compared with the baseline study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the subscales of the JDQoL, Negative Feelings (reversal item) significantly improved and Feeling of Belonging significantly decreased after one year (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Each subscale of the JDQoL had significant correlation with the GDS at baseline and follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Scores on the GDS at baseline had significant correlation with Self Esteem, Positive Feelings, Negative Feelings, and Feeling of Belonging of the JDQoL at follow-up (0.320 to 0.504; p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that the reliability and validity of the JDQoL was comparable to the English version of DQoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Subjective QOL did not decline for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sub-scales, Negative Feelings in the JDQoL significantly improved compared to baseline </plain></SENT>
