<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the potential value of tau levels in the differential diagnosis of AD, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) and major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> warrants further investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The potential impact of psychotropic medication also needs to be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau protein concentrations in 88 patients with AD, 23 patients with VD, 25 patients with major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and 17 age-paralleled controls without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> with respect to important clinical variables, type and dosage of psychotropic medication and cerebral changes as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The AD patients showed significantly elevated tau levels compared with patients with VD or major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tau levels obtained in the VD group were intermediate, with significant differences from both AD patients and patients with major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within the AD group, no significant correlation between tau levels, severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, age, duration of disease, type and dosage of psychotropic medication or MRI volumetric changes arose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A subgroup of AD patients without increased tau levels was characterized by a significantly larger percentage of patients with presenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
