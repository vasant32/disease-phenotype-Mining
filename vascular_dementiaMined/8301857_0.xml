<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured bone mineral densities of the vertebral body and the femoral neck using DEXA, and evaluated Ca-related factors in 22 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer type (DAT), 23 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), and 22 age-matched controls (C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Activity of daily living was significantly poorer in VD patients than controls, but no difference was shown between DAT and C groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone mineral density values of the vertebral body and the femoral neck were significantly decreased in both DAT and VD groups when compared to C group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DAT patients showed significant decreases in serum Ca and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> ion, increase in serum parathyroid hormone, and decrease in serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, a tendency towards decrease in serum calcitonin, and a tendency towards increase in urinary Ca </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, VD patients showed only significant increase in urinary Ca and a tendency towards decrease in serum 1,2-dihydroxyvitamin D, without showing other changes of Ca-regulating hormones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are more often associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo>, and that in DAT several abnormalities of Ca-regulating factors play an important role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo>, while in VD limited physical activities contribute to bone mineral loss </plain></SENT>
