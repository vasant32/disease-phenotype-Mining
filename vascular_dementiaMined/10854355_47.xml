<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors examined the association of incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and subtypes with age, sex, and geographic area in Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Incidence data from eight population-based studies carried out in seven European countries were compared and pooled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pooled data included 835 mild to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases and 42,996 person-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies a higher proportion of cases were diagnosed with AD (60 to 70% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> cases) than vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and AD continued to increase with age up to age 85 years, after which rates increased in women but not men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a large variation in VaD incidence across studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the pooled analysis, the incidence rates increased with age without any substantial difference between men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, higher incidence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and AD were found in the very old in northwest countries than in southern countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study confirms that AD is the most frequent dementing disorder in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages, and that there is a higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, specifically AD, in women than men among the very old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, there may be regional differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> incidence </plain></SENT>
