<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because there is considerable overlap between vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) in the pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, a reasonable approach to developing an optimal vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> battery is to begin with a widely used AD measure and improve its sensitivity to the cognitive domains that are more prominent in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus the VaDAS-cog has evolved, which comprises the ADAS-cog with additional frontal lobe subtests covering attention, working memory, executive function, and verbal fluency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Validation of this new cognitive instrument will be supported by its successful use in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> clinical trials </plain></SENT>
