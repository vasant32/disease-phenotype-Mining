<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to clarify relative frequencies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> neuropathologically in Japanese nursing home residents over a 17-year period and to clarify the gender and age effect on the relative frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three hundred ten aged nursing home residents (146 men and 164 women), including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases in Shimane prefecture, Japan, were evaluated clinically and neuropathologically over a period of 17 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two (48 men and 74 women) of the 310 autopsied (39%) had shown signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> during their lives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In classifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> type, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) accounted for 34% (41); VD 35% (42); mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> 11% (14); and "other" <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> 20% (25) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As to the gender and age effect, the most characteristic findings were as follows: (a) There were only VD cases in the 57-69-year-old group; (b) the 70-79 male age group lacked any cases with only AD; (c) more AD than VD was found in elderly men; and (d) in women, AD was the major cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in total </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: VD is responsible for the major cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the younger women and the men under 90 years of age; AD is the leading cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the elderly men and the women over 79 years of age in nursing homes, Shimane prefecture, Japan </plain></SENT>
