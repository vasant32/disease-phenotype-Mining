<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relationships between neuroimaging findings and performance on the MDRS in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) have not been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the relationships between subcortical hyperintensity (SH) volume and whole brain volume (WBV) on the subscales and total score of the MDRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results revealed that SH accounted for a significant amount of variance on the Initiation/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233651" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Perseveration</z:e> and Construction subscales, whereas WBV accounted for a significant amount of variance on the Memory subscale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The total score on the MDRS was found to be significantly related to WBV but not SH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that subcortical damage and brain volume account for different aspects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in VD and that overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> may reflect cortical and subcortical involvement </plain></SENT>
