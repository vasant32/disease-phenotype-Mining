<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reported the simultaneous occurrence of sleep spindles and alpha activity in the waking EEG in 12 patients with a mean age of 59.0 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients were diagnosed as cerebrovascular disorders such as cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean alpha frequency in the presence of WSA significantly decreased by 1.5 Hz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency and spatial distribution of waking spindle activity were similar to those of sleep spindles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In our cases, at least the two factors of cerebrovascular involvement and older adults were considered to be primarily responsible for the intrusion of sleep spindles into wakefulness (presumably a state close to very light <z:hpo ids='HP_0002329'>drowsiness</z:hpo>) due possibly to the instability of sleep-waking cycle regulation </plain></SENT>
