<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and the effects of different definitions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the diagnosis are still incompletely known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in a large <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our cohort consisted of consecutively admitted <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients (n = 486) aged 55 to 85 years in the Helsinki (Finland) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Aging Memory Study (<z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were assessed by structured medical, neurological, and radiological examinations and interview with a close informant, as well as by the Mini-Mental State Examination and detailed clinical mental status examination of defined cognitive domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were those of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>) (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV), the National Institute of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN), and the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that 451 (92.8%) of the patients were testable, 239 (49.2%) of the patients were women, and the mean age was 71.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> was present in 61.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the groups aged 55 to 64, 65 to 74, and 75 to 85 years, the frequency of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> was 45.7%, 53.8%, and 74.1% (P = .0008), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 25.5% by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III, 20.0% by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R, 18.4% by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV, 21.1% by NINDS-AIREN, and 6.0% by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10 criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequency increased with increasing age: by the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III definition, frequency in the aforementioned age groups was 19.3%, 23.7%, and 25.5%, respectively (P = .014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was an overlap in the cases diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> according to the different guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Compared with standard diagnosis, the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III was the most sensitive and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10 the most specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Concordance was moderate between the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> criteria and NINDS-AIREN criteria but was poor between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10 and the other criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>Cognitive decline</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were frequent in the cohort of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients, and the frequency increased with increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Different definitions gave different frequency estimates, and overlap in the cases was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our findings question the validity of current criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the setting of cerebrovascular disease and emphasize the need for further debate and studies to refine the categories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> related to cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
