<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Besides the distribution patterns of perfusion or energy metabolism, vascular transit time (VTT), vascular reactivity (VR), and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), which can be measured with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET), provide hemodynamic aspects of brain pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate the hemodynamic features of AD, PET studies were carried out in 20 patients with probable AD and 20 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The PET findings were not included in their diagnostic process of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36932">oxygen-15</z:chebi>-labeled compounds, cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2)), OEF, cerebral blood volume, and VTT were measured quantitatively during resting state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To evaluate VR, CBF was also measured during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> inhalation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase in OEF in and around the parietotemporal cortices, but both VTT and VR were well preserved in patients with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, VR was markedly depressed and VTT was mildly prolonged in patients with VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, from the hemodynamic point of view, the preservation of vascular reserve may be a distinct difference between AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this indicates a hemodynamic integrity of the vasculature in the level of arterioles in AD </plain></SENT>
