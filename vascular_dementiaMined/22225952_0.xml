<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined presumed differences in this time measure in participants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (PWD) versus participants without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (PWoutD), further subdivided into specific diagnoses and performance subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also studied its demographic, clinical, and cognitive correlates and predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A diagnostic role was hypothesized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-three individuals (27 PWD: 16 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer's type (DAT), 11 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD); 16 PWoutD: 10 major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0868892,C0868894,C0011581,C0012706,C0868893" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">depressive disorder</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e>), 6 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) were interviewed with the Cambridge Examination for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e> of the Elderly - Revised (CAMDEX-R) that permits the registration of this time measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Demographic, clinical, and cognitive data were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neither absolute accuracy of estimation of duration of interview nor its transformed logarithm were significantly different between PWD and PWoutD, or between DAT and VaD participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e> participants performed significantly poorer than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and did not differ from PWD, and the PWD relatively better performing subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The logarithm of absolute accuracy of estimation correlated with some clinical and cognitive variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only a measure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233818" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">impaired judgment</z:e> could significantly predict it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The absolute accuracy of estimation of time-intervals did not differ between the major groups and the main diagnoses subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It was associated with a variety of clinical and cognitive measures, and was predicted by the composite constructs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233818" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">impaired judgment</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic value of this measure in the psychogeriatric clinic is questionable, and limited to "worried" well individuals </plain></SENT>
