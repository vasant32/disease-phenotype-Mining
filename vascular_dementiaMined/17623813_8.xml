<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify the midlife risk factors for subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> newly developed later in life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A nested case-control study was conducted on 157 demented cases and 628 comparison cases selected from 40,636 men and women who were enrolled from 1982 to 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four comparison cases were frequency-matched on age, time at enrollment (within 6 months), gender, and residential township </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Midlife risk factors included vascular risk factors (body mass index [BMI], total cholesterol, total <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> [<z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>] history, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> history, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> history), cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> assessments were ascertained through the computerized data linkage from National Health Insurance Database from 2000 to 2002 and clinically confirmed by neurologists or psychiatrists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the matched odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A J-shaped relationship was observed between BMI (kg/m(2)) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The multivariate-adjusted ORs (95% CI) of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were 1.84 (1.02-3.33), 1.87 (1.08-3.23) and 2.44 (1.39-4.28), respectively, for BMIs of &lt;20.5, 23.0-25.4, &gt;or=25.5 compared with a BMI of 20.5-22.9 as the referent group (OR = 1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar findings were observed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (BMI &gt;or=25.5) and both AD and VaD was statistically significant among cigarette smokers but not among nonsmokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, history of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> was a significant risk factor for VaD, but not for AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Being underweight, being overweight, and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> in midlife may increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in late life </plain></SENT>
