<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have developed two HPLC systems for the simultaneous determination of CA, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> and their precursors and metabolites in human body fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One system consisted of two reversed-phase columns, a column switching device, a pair of electrodes for elimination of interferents and two sets of new electrochemical detectors with four electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using this system, adequate separation of peaks for 17 kinds of CA, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> and their related metabolites in a standard solution required only 17 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NE, MHPG, DOPAC, 5-HIAA, HVA and TRP levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were determined without any pretreatment of the CSF samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of DOPAC, 5-HIAA and HVA in CSF were significantly lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> than in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other system was developed for determination of CA acidic metabolites and 5-HIAA in human urine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This system consisted of a mixed-mode column (C18/<z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi>) and 8-channel electrochemical detector with isocratic elution of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> buffer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Detection limits, precision and analytical recoveries of this method were satisfactory for clinical use </plain></SENT>
