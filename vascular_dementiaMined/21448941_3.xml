<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate 7T MRI in the assessment of cerebrovascular alterations as seen in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> by means of detection of cerebral microbleeds (CMB) and depiction of white matter lesions (WML) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>7T imaging was evaluated with respect to 1.5T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers and 10 patients with CMBs and/or WMLs were examined at 1.5T and 7T using gradient-echo (T2*, SWI) and turbo-spin-echo sequences (FLAIR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparisons of image quality, CMB and WML detection rates between sequences and field strengths were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using high-resolution SWI at 7T 129 CMBs were detected compared to 75 at 1.5T using clinical SWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With T2* at 7T 101 CMBs could be detected (33 CMBs at 1.5T) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lesion sizes were significantly larger for higher field strength </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FLAIR images at 7T highlighted WMLs known from 1.5T with comparable extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Gray and white matter contrast in FLAIR was slightly better at 1.5T, whereas image resolution and contrast of the WMLs to surrounding tissue was higher at 7T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: By means of higher sensitivity for CMBs, 7T (SWI, T2*) might have significant impact on the early detection, diagnosis, and optimized antithrombotic therapy of cerebrovascular patients (eg, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) in the future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Given the current state of technical development, 7T is approximately on par with 1.5T in the depiction of WMLs and their distribution, but holds the potential for future improvements </plain></SENT>
