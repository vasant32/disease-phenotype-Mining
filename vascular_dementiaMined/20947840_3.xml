<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy of bone marrow mononuclear cell (BMMNC) treatment against ischemic white matter (WM) damage in a hypoperfused brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mice were administered intravenous treatment of vehicle, spleen-derived marrow mononuclear cells (MNCs), or BMMNCs (5 × 10⁶ cells) obtained from enhanced green fluorescent protein transgenic mice 24 hours after bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (BCAS), and then euthanized at either 1 day or 30 days after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Laser speckle perfusion imaging analyses revealed marked recovery of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the early phase after BMMNC treatment (6 hours after administration), before histological evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> was assessed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein-isothiocyanate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> perfusion assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BMMNC treatment induced an increase in vascular endothelial growth factor and Ser1177 phosphorylated endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase levels in the BCAS-induced mouse brains at 1 day after the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BCAS-induced ischemic WM lesions were significantly improved 30 days after BMMNC treatment despite any evidence of direct structural incorporation of donor BMMNCs into endothelial cells and oligodendrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Instead, enhanced green fluorescent protein-positive donor cells with morphological features of pericytes were observed in the vessel walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Post-BMMNC administration of an NOS inhibitor abolished early CBF recovery and produced protective effects against ischemic WM damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BMMNC treatment provides marked protection against ischemic WM damage, enhancing CBF in the early phase and in subsequent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, both of which involve nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest promise for the application of BMMNCs for subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
