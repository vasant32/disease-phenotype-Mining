<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among 1H MRS-detectable metabolites, N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> and N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-aspartyl-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> (tNAA), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18139">trimethylamines</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> phosphate (tCr), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> (Ins) and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> (Gla) are of particular interest, since these moieties can be assigned to specific neuronal and glial metabolic pathways, membrane constituents, and energy metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study on 94 subjects from a memory clinic population, 1H MRS results (single voxel STEAM: TE 20 ms, TR 1500 ms) on the above metabolites were assessed for five different brain regions in probable vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), and age-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both VD and AD, ratios of tNAA/tCr were decreased, which may be attributed to neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and loss, and Ins/tCr-ratios were increased indicating either enhanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> or alteration of the cerebral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the topographical distribution of the metabolic alterations in both diseases differed, revealing a temporoparietal pattern for AD and a global, subcortically pronounced pattern for VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients suffering from vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) had remarkably enhanced <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi>/tCr ratios, potentially due to ongoing degradation of myelin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the metabolic alterations obtained by 1H MRS in vivo allow insights into the pathophysiology of the different <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> and may be useful for diagnostic classification </plain></SENT>
