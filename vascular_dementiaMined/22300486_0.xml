<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Clinical subtypes of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) were assigned as potential prodromes to various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Amnestic MCI (aMCI) is said to have a high likelihood of progressing to Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD) and non-amnestic MCI (naMCI) subtypes are assumed to have a higher likelihood of progressing to non-AD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic accuracy of aMCI and naMCI for the development of AD, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), and mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this longitudinal study, 487 subjects without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (cognitively healthy: n = 387; MCI cases: n = 115) aged 75 years at baseline, who participated in a population-based cohort study (Vienna Transdanube Aging study), were available for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The observation period was 90 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnoses of the clinical MCI subtypes were made according to common criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The outcome (AD, VaD, mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) was described for both MCI subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic values of aMCI and naMCI according to incident AD, VaD, and mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AD was the most common type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> following both MCI subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Participants with aMCI were more likely to progress to AD than participants with naMCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The proportion of incident VaD and mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> did not differ concerning the MCI subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value for both MCI subtypes was low (range: 1%-46%), whereas the negative predictive value was high (range: 86%-99%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The increased risk of clinical MCI subtypes for a particular type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> could only be confirmed for aMCI and incident AD </plain></SENT>
