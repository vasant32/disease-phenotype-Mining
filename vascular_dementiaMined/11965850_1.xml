<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two years later the same authors described its association with chromosome 19; nonetheless, the mutations in gene Notch3 were not described until 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical findings depend on the age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The early form of the illness is found in young patients, generally less than 30 years old, and the main clinical manifestation is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine headache</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical lesions</z:e> in the white matter, while in the later form ischemic events and behavioral symptoms are predominant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anatomo-pathological findings in CADASIL include the presence of osmophilic granular deposits in vessel walls, skin, muscles and cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We present a patient with CADASIL and cavernous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We studied a 40-year-old woman who underwent surgery for a left temporal-parietal cavernous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp>, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> as the only symptom, two years before admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Her family history showed that her father had suffered from vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>She was admitted to our hospital with right-side <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A CT scan showed the presence of ischemic vascular lesions and former surgery sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The duplex scan of the neck vessels and a transesophageal echocardiogram ruled out an embolic source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Laboratory tests including VDRL, HIV, prothrombotic profile and rheumatologic screening tests were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An MRI in T2W and FLAIR showed the presence of multiple subcortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> and hyperintensity in the white matter (leukoencephalopaty) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We found a left <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> putaminal-capsular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the diffusion-MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The MRA was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid was unremarkable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A molecular DNA test was performed, and a nucleotide substitution in position 583 in exon 4 of gene Notch3 was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This mutation was found only in CADASIL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The association with cavernous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> has not been previously reported, and we believe that it was unrelated to CADASIL, either clinically or genetically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first case of CADASIL diagnosed by molecular DNA test in our country </plain></SENT>
