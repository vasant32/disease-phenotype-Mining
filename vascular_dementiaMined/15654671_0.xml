<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The investigations of rCBF were carried out using SPECT (Single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">Photon</z:chebi> Emission Computed Tomography) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results given concern investigations of patients carried out at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the investigation, after 12 months, and 24 months of rivastigmine treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients with AD it was found that treatment with rivastigmine increases rCBF by 5-7% in the temporal areas during the first 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the frontal areas the increase was by 3-5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the next 12 months rCBF with an accuracy of 2% returned to the initial level, with the exception of the motor cortex, where it remained on the level increased by 5-6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the cognitive functions remained constant during the first 12 months of treatment and decreased significantly during the next 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with VaD rCBF increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the regions of the brain except for the temporal posterior regions, and remained at an elevated level for the next 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cognitive functions deteriorated slowly, but to a much lesser degree than in the case of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: From the investigations carried out it follows that treatment with rivastigmine during 24 months prevents a decrease of rCBF in patients with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the cognitive functions deteriorate after 24 months </plain></SENT>
