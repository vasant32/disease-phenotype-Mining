<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The epidemic growth of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> causes great concern for the society </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is customary to consider <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) as the most common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, followed by vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This dichotomous view of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative disease</z:hpo> as opposed to brain damage caused by extrinsic factors led to separate lines of research in these two entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indeed, accumulated data suggest that the two disorders have additive effects and probably interact; however it is still unknown to what degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, epidemiological studies have shown "vascular" risk factors to be associated with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a clear distinction between AD and VaD cannot be made in most cases, and is furthermore unhelpful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the absence of efficacious treatment for the neurodegenerative process, special attention must be given to the vascular component, even in patients with presumed mixed pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic treatment of VaD and AD is similar, although the former is less effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> it is important to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> factors aggressively, even in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> survivors who do not show evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this review, we will give a clinical and pathological picture of the processes leading to VaD and discuss its interaction with AD </plain></SENT>
