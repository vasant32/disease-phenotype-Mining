<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the physiological roles of this serine protease are unknown, in vitro substrates include amyloid precursor protein and components of the extracellular matrix, which are altered in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disease</z:e>, particularly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have compared KLK6 expression in post-mortem brain tissue in AD, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the distribution of KLK6 in the temporal cortex and white matter by immunohistochemistry, and measured KLK6 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels in the frontal and temporal cortex from 15 AD, 15 VaD and 15 control brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry showed KLK6 to be restricted to endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for variations in vessel density by measurement of factor VIII-related antigen, we found KLK6 protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels to be significantly decreased in the frontal but not the temporal cortex in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In VaD, KLK6 protein level was significantly increased in the frontal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that an altered KLK6 expression may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> in AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
