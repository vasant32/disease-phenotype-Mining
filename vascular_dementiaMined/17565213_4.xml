<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty patients who were diagnosed to have vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were randomly assigned to three arms: group reminiscence arm, social contact arm, and control arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 1-hour session of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GRA</z:e> and social contact was given once a week for 3 months to the group reminiscence and the social contact arm, respectively </plain></SENT>
