<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Western memory clinic-based series, VaD/CVI is suggested in 8-10% of cognitively impaired elderly; its prevalence in autopsy series ranges from 0.03% to 58% (mean 5-15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fairly unusual as an isolated nosological entity, CVI appears to correlate with focal, multifocal or diffuse cortical and/or subcortical microinfarcts and lacunes often affecting strategically important brain areas (thalamus, frontobasal, limbic system), hemispheric white matter and, less often, large brain areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They result from systemic, cardiac or local large or small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lesion pattern in "pure" VCI with predominant multiple small (subcortical) lesions related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathies</z:e> differs from that in "mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>" (AD+VaD), more often associated with large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, suggesting different pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In very old subjects, selective hippocampal <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> may be accompanied by multiple other vascular pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Minor cerebrovascular lesions (CVL), except for severe amyloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e>, appear not essential for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in full-blown AD, while both mild AD-type pathology and small vessel disease may interact synergistically in "unmasking" or promoting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AD pathology is significantly less severe in the presence of cerebrovascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to validate diagnostic criteria for VCI and to clarify the impact of vascular lesions on <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
