<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epidemiologic studies examining the association between <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> have reported conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High total cholesterol has been associated with both an increased, and decreased, risk of AD and/or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VAD), whereas other studies found no association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> concentration in patients with probable AD, as well as possible correlation between serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> concentrations and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our cross-sectional study included 30 patients with probable AD and 30 age and sex matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The probable AD was clinically diagnosed by NINCDS-ADRDA criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum total cholesterol (TC), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (TG) levels were determined at the initial assessment using standard enzymatic colorimetric techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47773">very low density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47773">VLDL-C</z:chebi>) levels were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subjects with probable AD had significantly lower serum TG (p&lt;0,01), TC (p&lt;0,05), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> (p&lt;0,05) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47773">VLDL-C</z:chebi> (p&lt;0,01) compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We did not observe significant difference in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> level between patients with probable AD and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Negative, although not significant correlation between TG, TC and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47773">VLDL-C</z:chebi> and MMSE in patients with AD was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the control group of subjects there was a negative correlation between TC and MMSE but it was not statistically significant (r = -0,28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to explore the possibility for serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> to serve as diagnostic and therapeutic markers of AD </plain></SENT>
