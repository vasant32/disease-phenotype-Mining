<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Participants were recruited among residents of a suburb of Rotterdam, aged 55 years and older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline examinations took place between 1990 and 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The average follow-up was 2.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> followed a three-stage protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Medical records of subjects who had died or could not be examined in person were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 7,046 subjects who were nondemented at baseline, 162 developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> during 15,135 person-years of follow-up, resulting in an overall incidence rate of 10.7 per 1,000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From the youngest to the oldest 5-year age category, the incidence rate increased from 0.6 to 97.2 per 1,000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only in men did the increase level off after age 85 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, the incidence rate per 1,000 person-years was 7.7 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and 1.5 for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although the incidence rates of men and women up to age 85 were similar, the lifetime risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> for 55-year-old women was twice as high as for men (0.33 vs. 0.16), reflecting both the higher life expectancy of women and the higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> risk at very old age </plain></SENT>
