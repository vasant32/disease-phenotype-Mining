<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A steady but selective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> was observed with increasing age in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most sensitive areas of cognition to the effects of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aging were mnestic and conceptual functions, as well as arithmetical skills </plain></SENT>
