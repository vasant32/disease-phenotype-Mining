<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In phase 1, 1,034 elderly were interviewed with the Cantonese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Those who scored below the cutoff points and a subsample of those with scores in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range were interviewed in phase 2 to identify those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall weighted prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in our subjects was 6.1 +/- 0.7%, which is at the lower end of the range of rates reported in whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) accounted for 64.6% and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 29.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results, together with previous studies in Chinese populations, suggest that the rates of AD in Chinese are low compared with those in whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Substantial differences are possible in the epidemiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> across cultures related to interactions of genetic and environmental factors </plain></SENT>
