<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>White matter alterations</z:hpo> were measured using a 40-point scale previously described by Junque et al </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects with cortical <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVAs</z:chebi> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On executive control tests, IVD subjects made more preservations on tests of mental control and response set, and produced fewer responses on phonemic controlled oral word association tests (letters: F,A,S) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IVD subjects also made more preservations and graphomotor errors on clock drawings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the California Verbal Learning Test the IVD group performed better than AD subjects on the short delay free recall test condition, the recognition discriminability index, and made fewer intrusion errors on both free and cued recall conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that neuropsychological assessment can differentiate AD from IVD associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter alterations</z:hpo>, and that the neuropsychological profile of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> subjects with significant periventricular and deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter alterations</z:hpo> is similar to other subcortical dementing illnesses </plain></SENT>
