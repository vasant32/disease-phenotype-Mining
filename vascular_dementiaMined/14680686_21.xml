<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> complexes exhibited a great capacity to protect brain <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> against peroxidation with IC50 of 6.3-26.3 microM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> complexes showed much greater SOD activity than their corresponding <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> ligands as well as trolox with IC50 values of 8.9-29.9 microM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AcylCp and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> complexes (AcylCpCpx and CpCpx) also gave the highest inhibitory activity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi>-induced cell damage (<z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>) at 0.1 microg/ml (&lt; 0.2 microM) in NG108-15 cells, which were more potent than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> and related compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neuropharmacological tests in mice supported the idea that the SOD mimicking complexes were able to penetrate to the brain as well as their role in the modulation of brain <z:chebi fb="65" ids="25512">neurotransmitters</z:chebi> under the aberrant conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The complexes significantly improved the learning and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> induced by transient ischemic/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AcylCpCpx, CpCpx, and CpEDCpx showed significant protection at 6.25, 25, and 50 mg/kg (i.p.), respectively, whereas <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> had no effect at doses of 50 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, treatment of AcylCpCpx and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> significantly attenuated MPTP-induced striatal <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> in mice, which was in accordance with the increase in the density of dopaminergic neurons when compared with MPTP-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results support the important role of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> in importing SOD activity and consequently, the enhancement of radical scavenging activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AcylCpCpx and CpCpx seem to be the most promising neuroprotective agents for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
