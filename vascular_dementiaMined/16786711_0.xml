<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Out of an average total of 1400 autopsies per year, neuropathological examinations were performed in 477 cases between 1997 and 1999 to investigate the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of the studied subjects were over 50 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1389790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Bielschowsky</z:e>'s and/or Gallyas's silver methods and, in some cases, protein tau (MAP) immunocytochemistry and amyloid staining were performed beside routine examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pathological changes were found in 212 of the 364 cases studied by the above methods but histological changes associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were only detected in 167 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The various forms of Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were also classified by age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The "incipient" form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> was verified in 23 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Old <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of various extensions were found in 42 percent of Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Very mild or age-related degenerative changes were observed in 82 cases among subjects over 50 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these, eight patients died in their 90s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In some cases (n = 38) the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>neuritic plaques</z:hpo> dominated over the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo> but a reverse finding also occurred (n = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>Neuronal degeneration</z:mp> was variable and was not always proportional to the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo>. "Simple type of senile <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>" was defined by the presence of minor or age-related Alzheimer changes and was considered a separate entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The "incipient" form of Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was diagnosed in relatively young individuals where mild Alzheimer changes were found at the neuropathological examination. "Preclinical" Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> could only be suspected by clinical data and could very rarely be supported by the neuropathological finding of "incipient" form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The ratio of pure Alzheimer's to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> cases proved to be 54:41 in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> are considerably underdiagnosed both in the clinical and pathological practice and that the recently defined "preclinical" and "incipient" forms are very hard to recognize both clinically and pathologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The neuropathological study of the degenerative, mainly Alzheimer's type, findings in the randomly selected autopsies revealed great variations which raises many questions concerning the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathologic aging of the brain as well as the "incipient" and senile forms of Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
