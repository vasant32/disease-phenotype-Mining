<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnoses are not always consistent with neuropathological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As correct diagnosis is important for treatment and care, new diagnostic possibilities for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are in demand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers should ideally be able to identify ongoing processes in the brain, but need to be further compared with neuropathological findings for evaluation of their diagnostic validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included 43 patients with a clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were neuropathologically examined at the University Hospital in Lund, Sweden, during the years 2001-2008, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had a lumbar puncture carried out as part of the clinical investigation during the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of eight patients, five with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> had elevated total tau protein (T-tau) and decreased amyloid beta 1-42 protein (Abeta42), while both values for the other three patients were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Slightly elevated T-tau and/or decreased Abeta42 were also seen in several patients with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnoses such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752347" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="DLB">Lewy body disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751072" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="FTLD">frontotemporal lobar degeneration</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, T-tau levels did not differ markedly between patients with morphologically tau-positive and tau-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751072" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="FTLD">frontotemporal lobar degeneration</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, seven of nine patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease</z:e> exhibited pronounced elevation in T-tau concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: From this rather limited study, being the first of its kind in Sweden, we may conclude that there is no perfect concordance between cerebrospinal fluid biomarker levels and pathological findings, which should be taken into account in the clinical diagnostic setting </plain></SENT>
