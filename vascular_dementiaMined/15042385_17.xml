<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> function of young adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) in order to determine earlier changes in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SHR and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone SHR (SHRSP) were injected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as an indicator of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> function and compared with Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The brain tissues were further examined with cationized ferritin, a marker for evaluating glycocalyx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The staining for HRP was distributed around the vessels in the hippocampal fissure of SHR and SHRSP, but not in WKY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With electron microscopy, the extravasated reaction product of HRP appeared in abluminal pits of the endothelial cells of arterioles and within the basal lamina in the hippocampus, but not the cerebral cortex, of SHR and SHRSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, the reaction product of HRP was never seen in the abluminal pits of the endothelial cells or the basal lamina of vessels in WKY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of cationized ferritin particles binding to the endothelial cells of capillaries was decreased in the hippocampus of SHR and SHRSP, while the number decreased in the cerebral cortex of SHRSP compared with those in WKY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the cationized ferritin binding was preserved in the endothelial cells of the arterioles with an <z:mp ids='MP_0003070'>increased vascular permeability</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hypertensive state induces <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> dysfunction in the hippocampus at an early stage </plain></SENT>
