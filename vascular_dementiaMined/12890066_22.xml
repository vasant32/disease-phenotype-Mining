<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective population-based cohort with four interview waves and complete vital status ascertainment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Urban and rural communities in the Aquitaine Region (Gironde and Dordogne), southwest France </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Three thousand seven hundred seventy-seven adults aged 65 and older residing in noninstitutional settings at study baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Each participant was interviewed by a neuropsychologist and screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with the Mini-Mental State Examination, a cognitive test battery, and a standardized questionnaire designed to ascertain the presence of the criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e>, Third Edition, Revised (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> status and subtype were confirmed using neurological examination and categorized according to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and the National Institute of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>/Alzheimer's and Related Disorders Association criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Hachinski score was calculated to specify the etiology: possible or probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Depressive symptomatology was evaluated using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses were weighted to correct for attrition not due to mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-seven men (incidence rate: 14.4/1,000) and 183 women (Incidence rate: 19.0/1,000) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> during 8 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Baseline prevalence of depressive symptomatology was 12.9% for men and 14.7% for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Depressive symptoms increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at subsequent interview wave, but only for men (odds ratio (OR) (men) = 3.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.9-6.5; OR (women) = 1.2, 95% CI = 0.7-2.0, P-value for sex difference = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis that vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> might explain the observed sex difference was studied, and it was found that risk was 50% higher for men with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> who were depressed than for normotensive men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For women, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> status did not modify the absence of an association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study supports the hypothesis of a relationship between proximal depressive symptomatology and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in men, but distant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> did not increase <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> risk in this sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in older men might reflect a form of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> associated with cerebral vascular pathology or multiinfarct disease that may amplify the dementing or declining process, hence accelerating the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of manifest symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
