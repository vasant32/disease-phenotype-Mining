<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare serum <z:chebi fb="25" ids="50112">sex hormone</z:chebi> levels between VaD patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, and to further determine the link between sex hormones and cognitive and neuropsychiatric manifestations of VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of total <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> (TE2), total <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> (TT), luteinizing hormone (LH), and <z:chebi fb="25" ids="50112">sex hormone</z:chebi> binding globulin (SHBG) were measured in 87 VaD patients and 110 cognitive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The levels of bioavailable <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> (BE2) and bioavailable <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> (BT) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The VaD patients underwent the tests of global cognitive function, verbal memory, and visuospatial, and executive ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was used to assess neuropsychiatric symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to controls, the <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> and SHBG levels were lower in male VaD patients, and the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> levels were higher in female VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hormones levels were not correlated with cognitive functions among either male or female VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no associations between hormone levels and neuropsychiatric symptoms among male patients, while the TE2 and TT levels were positively associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, respectively among female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggested there were <z:chebi fb="25" ids="50112">sex hormone</z:chebi> level changes in VaD patients in comparison with cognitive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sex hormones were associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms among female but not male VaD patients </plain></SENT>
