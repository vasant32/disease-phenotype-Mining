<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>121 patients with SIVD were recruited from multiple nationwide hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients' neurologic signs were evaluated using the Focal Neurologic Sign Score (FNSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The FNSS scores did not correlate with the composite neuropsychology scores and Korean Mini-Mental State Examination scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The FNSS scores correlated with the letter fluency and Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF) copy scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using a multivariate regression analysis controlled for age, sex, and educational level, the FNSS scores had a significant relationship with the letter fluency test scores (R (2) = 0.08, β = -2.28, p = 0.02) and ROCF copy scores (R (2) = 0.08, β = -0.42, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the neurologic signs in patients with SIVD do not correlate with global cognitive functions; however, these signs do correlate with executive dysfunction in these patients </plain></SENT>
