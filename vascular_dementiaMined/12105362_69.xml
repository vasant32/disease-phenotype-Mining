<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this multicenter, 28-week trial carried out in France, 321 patients received 10 mg/d memantine or placebo twice a day; 288 patients were valid for intent-to-treat analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients had to meet the criteria for probable vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and have a Mini-Mental State (MMSE) score between 12 and 20 at inclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 2 primary end points were the cognitive subscale of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimers Disease</z:hpo> Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog) and the global Clinician's Interview Based Impression of Change (CIBIC-plus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 28 weeks, the mean ADAS-cog scores were significantly improved relative to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the intention-to-treat population, the memantine group mean score had gained an average of 0.4 points, whereas the placebo group mean score had declined by 1.6 points, ie, a difference of 2.0 points (95% confidence interval, 0.49 to 3.60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The response rate for CIBIC-plus, defined as improved or stable, was 60% with memantine compared with 52% with placebo (P=0.227, intention to treat) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the secondary efficacy parameters, which were analyzed in the per-protocol subset, MMSE was significantly improved with memantine compared with deterioration with placebo (P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Gottfries-Brane-Steen Scale intellectual function subscore and the Nurses' Observation Scale for Geriatric Patients disturbing behavior dimension also showed differences in favor of memantine (P=0.04 and P=0.07, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Memantine was well tolerated with a frequency of adverse events comparable to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mild to moderate vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, memantine 20 mg/d improved cognition consistently across different cognitive scales, with at least no deterioration in global functioning and behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It was devoid of concerning side effects </plain></SENT>
