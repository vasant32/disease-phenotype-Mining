<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the level and phosphorylation states of NF subunits in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from living patients by bienzyme substrate-recycle enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found: (i), that the levels of phosphorylated NF-H/M (pNF-H/M), non-phosphorylated NF-H/M (npNF-H/M) and NF-L were significantly higher (pNF-H/M, approximately 12-24-fold; npNF-H/M, approximately 3-4-fold) in neurologically healthy aged people than young control individuals; (ii), that in AD, the levels of npNF-H/M, and NF-L were similar to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), and higher than in age-matched controls; and (iii), that the levels of pNF-H/M were significantly higher than in aged controls, non-AD <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, it is suggested that the increased level of total NF proteins in CSF could be used as a marker for brain aging and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> in general, and the levels of pNF-H/M as a marker to discriminate AD from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain aging and as well as neurological conditions including VaD </plain></SENT>
