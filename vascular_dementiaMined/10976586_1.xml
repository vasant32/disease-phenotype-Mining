<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The short half-life (about 15 min) of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> at the terminal elimination phase and poor bioavailability after oral administration of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> to rabbits (Kim et al., 1992) suggest in part that this drug takes the extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the metabolic pathway for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this experiment is to identify urinary metabolites of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the identification of the metabolites, rat urine was collected after oral administration of 100 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> metabolite, 3-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-1-(5-hydroxyhexyl)-7-propylxanthine, was synthesized and confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The urinary metabolites of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> were extracted with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35702">diethyl ether</z:chebi> and identified by electron impact and chemical ionization GC/MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One urinary metabolite was confirmed to be 3-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-1-(5-hydroxyhexyl)-7-propylxanthine by synthesized authentic compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Several metabolites of monohydroxy- and dihydroxy-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> were identified based on mass fragmentation of both intact and trimethylsilylated derivatives of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> metabolites and the novel structure of these metabolites is suggested based on mass spectra </plain></SENT>
