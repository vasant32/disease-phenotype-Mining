<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Even we know that using techniques as the Single Strand Conformational Polymorphisms (SSCP) could determine mutations in Notch3, the rationality of this approach is that intronic variations could not be defined and that we are interested in determine if some forms of the clinical presentation and its <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>phenotypic variability</z:hpo> make part of CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The CADASIL phenotype is caused by mutations in the Notch3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical features of CADASIL are: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recurrent cerebra-vascular episodes; 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>Migraine</z:hpo> history; 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>History of transitory ischemic attack and, 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Behavior changes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: By using SIMLINK we showed that the extended genealogy had the enough power to detect significant LOD (logarithm of oods) score values when Notch3 was considered the disorder cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Linkage analysis was carried out by using parametric and non parametrical methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Elston-Stewart general method was used as the parametrical analysis and the sib pair method as the non-parametrical one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We perform simulations changing the affection status codification by including as affected or not including those individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in order to detect the stability of the results, we changed the penetrance values, the genetic frequencies on both, the marker loci and the affection locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The maximum pair-wise LOD score was 2.04 which was detected at the marker D19S23 with q= 0.11cM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This distance correspond exactly with the Notch3 location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>That is 100 times more probable that there is linkage that there is not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In other words this probability could be explained as if the phenotype correspond to CADASIL than to other vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The non parametric results were compatibles with the parametric ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>When the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> symptom was considered as a part of the affected status, the LOD score values showed not linkage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: The results of the linkage analysis to these STR microsatellite markers suggest that the vascular hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> phenotype described in this family correspond to CADASIL caused by a polymorphism on the Notch3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, these same results suggest that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> phenotype is not a part of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>progressive dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
