<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As compared with other conventional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38462">acetylcholinesterase inhibitors</z:chebi> (AChEIs), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> is a highly selective and reversible <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18049">piperidine</z:chebi> derivative with AChEI activity that exhibits the best pharmacological profile in terms of cognitive improvement, responders rate (40%-58%), dropout cases (5%-13%), and side-effects (6%-13%) in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> represents a non cost-effective treatment, most studies convey that this drug can provide a modest benefit on cognition, behavior, and activities of the daily living in both moderate and severe AD, contributing to slow down disease progression and, to a lesser exetnt, to delay institutionalization </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some potential effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> on the AD brain, leading to reduced cortico-hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, include the following: AChE inhibition, enhancement of cholinergic neurotransmission and putative modulation of other neurotransmitter systems, protection against <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced excitotoxicity, activation of neurotrophic mechanisms, promotion of non-amyloidodgenic pathways for APP processing, and indirect effects on cerebrovascular function improving brain perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recent studies demonstrate that the therapeutic response in AD is genotype-specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">Donepezil</z:chebi> is metabolized via <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">CYP</z:chebi>-related enzymes, especially CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Approximately, 15%-20% of the AD population may exhibit an <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>abnormal metabolism</z:mp> of AChEIs; about 50% of this population cluster would show an ultrarapid metabolism, requiring higher doses of AChEIs to reach a therapeutic threshold, whereas the other 50% of the cluster would exhibit a poor metabolism, displaying potential adverse events at low doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In AD patients treated with a multifactorial therapy, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi>, the best responders are the CYP2D6-related extensive (EM)(*1/*1, *1/*10) (57.47%) and intermediate metabolizers (IM)(*1/*3, *1/*5, *1/*6, *7/*10) (25.29%), and the worst responders are the poor (PM) (*4/*4)(9.20%) and ultra-rapid metabolizers (UM) (*1xN/*1) (8.04%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic factors may account for 75%-85% of the therapeutic response in AD patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> and other AChEIs metabolized via enzymes of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">CYP</z:chebi> family </plain></SENT>
