<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preliminary studies have suggested that HRV may be impaired in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HRV has not been studied in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigate autonomic function in AD and VAD, using power spectral analysis of HRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred and fourteen participants were evaluated (14 AD, 20 VAD and 80 controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The resting ECG was recorded for 5 min with participants in the supine position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Power spectral analysis used to obtain spectral bands in the very-low-frequency (&lt;0.04 Hz), low-frequency (0.04-0.15 Hz) and high-frequency (0.15-0.40 Hz) bands and total spectral power (&lt;0.40 Hz) according to international HRV guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in HRV in patients with AD or VAD when compared with controls </plain></SENT>
