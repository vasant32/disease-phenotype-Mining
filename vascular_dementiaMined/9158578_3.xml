<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: After <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (FTD) are among the most common dementing illnesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FTD may have a neuropsychological profile similar to that of VaD, and patients with these <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> may be difficult to distinguish on clinical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to elucidate distinct cognitive profiles of a large group of FTD and VaD patients on a brief, clinical mental status examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A comparison of 39 FTD patients and 39 VaD patients on a brief, clinical mental status examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Research Center and affiliated, university hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The FTD patients were diagnosed by noncognitive clinical and neuroimaging criteria, and the VaD patients met NINDS-AIREN criteria for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The two <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups were comparable on three <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> assessment scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: The mental status measures included the neuropsychological battery from the Consortium to Establish a Registry for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> (CERAD), plus supplementation from the Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination (NCSE) for cognitive areas not assessed by the CERAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The FTD and VaD groups differed significantly on the mental status examination measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FTD patients performed significantly better than the VaD patients on digit span and constructions, despite comparable performance by both groups on calculations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although not statistically significant, the FTD group performed worse than the VaD group on verbal fluency and abstractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These differences were not explained by group differences in age and education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that cognitive differences between FTD and VaD groups reflect greater frontal pathology in contrast to relative sparing of posterior cortex and subcortical white matter in FTD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These cognitive differences as measured by a mental status examination may help distinguish between these two <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
