<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work is to determine the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> among the population of Al Kharga District, New Valley, Egypt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Screening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects aged ≥50 years (n = 8,173 out of 62,583 inhabitants) was done through a door-to-door survey by 3 neurologists, using a short standardized Arabic screening test and a modified Mini-Mental State Examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Suspected cases were subjected to full clinical examination, psychometric assessment using the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, Geriatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale, Hachinski Ischemic Score, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV-TR diagnostic criteria, neuroimaging, and laboratory investigations, when indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 2.26% for the population aged ≥50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It increased steeply with age to a maximum of 18.48% for those aged ≥80 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (51.2%) was the most common subtype, followed by vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (28.7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> due to general medical conditions (12.8%), and lastly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> due to multiple etiologies (7.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was the commonest (53.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> is prevalent in Egypt as elsewhere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Detection through a door-to-door survey is the best method in developing countries for early detection of mild cases </plain></SENT>
