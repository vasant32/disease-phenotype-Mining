<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle factors such as intellectual stimulation, cognitive and social engagement, nutrition, and various types of exercise appear to reduce the risk for common age-associated disorders such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In fact, many studies have suggested that promoting physical activity can have a protective effect against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e> later in life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Slowing or a deterioration of walking speed is associated with a poor performance in tests assessing psychomotor speed and verbal fluency in elderly individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fitness training influences a wide range of cognitive processes, and the largest positive impact observed is for executive (a.k.a. frontal lobe) functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies show that exercise improves additional cognitive functions such as tasks mediated by the hippocampus, and result in major changes in plasticity in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, this exercise-induced plasticity is also pronounced in APOE ε4 carriers who express a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> AD that may modulate the effect of treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on AD staging by Braak and Braak (1991) and Braak et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(1993) we propose that the effects of exercise occur in two temporo-spatial continua of events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The "inward" continuum from isocortex (neocortex) to entorhinal cortex/hippocampus for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> and a reciprocal "outward" continuum for neurofibrillary alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The exercise-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the hippocampus at the core of these continua is evaluated in terms of potential for prevention to stave off <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Exercise-induced production of growth factors such as the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been shown to enhance neurogenesis and to play a key role in positive cognitive effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) may mediate the exercise-induced response to exercise on BDNF, neurogenesis, and cognitive performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is also postulated to regulate brain amyloid β (Aβ) levels by increased clearance via the choroid plexus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Growth factors, specifically fibroblast growth factor and IGF-1 receptors and/or their downstream signaling pathways may interact with the Klotho gene which functions as an aging suppressor gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Neurons may not be the only cells affected by exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Glia (astrocytes and microglia), neurovascular units and the Fourth Element may also be affected in a differential fashion by the AD process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Analyses of these factors, as suggested by the multi-dimensional matrix approach, are needed to improve our understanding of this complex multi-factorial process, which is increasingly relevant to conquering the escalating and intersecting world-wide epidemics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and sarcopenia that threaten the global healthcare system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Physical activity and interventions aimed at enhancing and/or mimicking the effects of exercise are likely to play a significant role in mitigating these epidemics, together with the embryonic efforts to develop cognitive rehabilitation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
