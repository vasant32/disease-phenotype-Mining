<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of tHcy and cognitive function in the elderly, and assess whether this may be mediated by structural brain changes on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Rotterdam Scan Study is a population-based study of 1,077 nondemented elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cognitive performance was assessed, and compound scores were constructed for psychomotor speed, memory function, and global cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, white matter lesions, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002283'>generalized brain atrophy</z:hpo> were measured on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cross-sectional relationship between tHcy levels and neuropsychological test scores was assessed by multiple regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean tHcy level was 11.5 micro mol/L (SD 4.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increasing tHcy levels were associated with lower scores for psychomotor speed, memory function, and global cognitive function, and this was largely due to the association with tHcy levels in the upper quintile (&gt;14 micro mol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adjusted differences between test scores of participants in the upper quintile as compared with the lower four quintiles of tHcy were -0.26 (95% CI: -0.37; -0.14) for psychomotor speed, -0.13 (95% CI: -0.27; 0.01) for memory function, and -0.20 (95% CI: -0.30; -0.11) for global cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These associations were not mediated by structural brain changes on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Elevated tHcy levels are associated with decreased cognitive performance in nondemented elderly people, and the relation was most marked for psychomotor speed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This association was independent of structural brain changes on MRI </plain></SENT>
