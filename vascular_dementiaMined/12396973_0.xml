<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Apart from inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, galantamine modulates the nicotinic receptors, although the clinical significance of this action remains uncertain </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initially, the maintenance dose must be 16 mg a day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Later on, 24 mg dose attempts are justified on an individual patient basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A clinical stabilization for almost one year is observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After that time, treated patients deteriorate at a similar pace than the non-treated ones, but they remain above the non-treated during at least one more year </plain></SENT>
