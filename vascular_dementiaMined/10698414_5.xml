<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The authors describe a patient in whom neuroimaging using Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT, F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18 FDG) coincidence imaging, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751012" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anterior choroidal artery infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging played a critical role in confirming this diagnosis, because the patient had symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>progressive cognitive decline</z:hpo> and satisfied the National Institute of Neurological and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009460" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Communicative Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> and Related Disorders Association criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECT was performed using a triple-head gamma camera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>F-18 FDG scanning was obtained 40 minutes after intravenous injection of 5 mCi F-18 FDG using a coincidence camera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A brain MRI scan was performed using a 1.5-Tesla scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT showed focal hypoperfusion to the right parahippocampal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>F-18 FDG coincidence imaging showed a more extensive reduction in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism compared with SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The MRI scan confirmed the presence of a small segmental choroidal artery infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Tc-99m HMPAO and F-18 FDG scans were not consistent with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates the value of the regional cerebral blood flow SPECT for evaluating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Decreased regional cerebral blood flow to the posterior temporoparietal region is consistent with AD, whereas regional cerebral blood flow diminution in a vascular territory is consistent with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this case, the patient was clinically diagnosed with AD, and SPECT was performed to establish the baseline regional cerebral blood flow before the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37733">cholinesterase inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An infarction was diagnosed on the regional cerebral blood flow brain SPECT scan, which was later confirmed by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Infarctions of the parahippocampal cortex may resuft in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo>, which can appear clinically similar to AD </plain></SENT>
