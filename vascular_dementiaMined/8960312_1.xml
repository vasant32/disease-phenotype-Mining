<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the light microscopy level, the bodies were clearly separated from the surrounding tissues and were mostly round or elliptic with a diameter of 5-30 microns and a central, intensely eosinophilic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructurally, they consisted of a central homogeneous electron-dense body (HDB), and filamentous structures (resembling either neurofilaments or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>paired helical filaments</z:hpo>) or other small organelles in the periphery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, some of these bodies exhibited ring-shaped rims which were positive with antibodies against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>paired helical filaments</z:hpo>, tau-2, phosphorylated neurofilaments and ubiquitin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The bodies were widely distributed throughout the cerebral cortex, but were not observed in the white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These bodies were thought to be compatible with one type of <z:mp ids='MP_0003225'>axonal dystrophy</z:mp> in the gracile nucleus (termed 'old' spheroid by Jellinger), and are here referred to as the HDB-type spheroid based on their ultrastructure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this study HDB-type spheroids were found in high incidence in the AD cases, but only two HDB-type spheroids were seen in one case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236642" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pick's disease</z:e>, and none in any of the other cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> or in the elderly non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It seems plausible that the incidence of HDB-type spheroids in the cerebral cortex might be related to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath> and not to a physiological ageing phenomenon, and might be characteristic of, but not unique to, AD </plain></SENT>
