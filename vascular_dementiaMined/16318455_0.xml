<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to determine whether profile and screening scores discriminated between cases classified as vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VAD) or nonvascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (NVG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was made on the basis of CT scan, neuropsychological assessment, and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e> (3rd ed., rev.; American Psychiatric Association, 1987) criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A nonparametric statistical analysis indicated significant differences between the VAD and the NVG on bath the profile and screening scores and on 5 of the 12 RBMT subtests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Discriminant analysis indicated that a combination of four subtests resulted in an error rate of 3% in classifying cases as VAD or NVG in this sample </plain></SENT>
