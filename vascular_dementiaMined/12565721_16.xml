<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Platelets have been implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025261" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory disorders</z:e> but this has not been investigated in patients with immune or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> is an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autoimmune disorder</z:e> in which autoantibodies bring about platelet destruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously reported a group of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients who manifested <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>-like syndrome and gradual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory loss</z:hpo> leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>: platelet microparticles (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMP</z:chebi>), a marker of platelet activation, were often elevated, suggesting that procoagulant <z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMP</z:chebi> released from stimulated platelets contributed to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in small vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have expanded on those studies to better define the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics of this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients with this syndrome were studied in comparison to twenty-three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients without it (patient controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical and laboratory features were compared and radiologic images were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Factors influencing the rate of progression to advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Recurring dizzy or weak spells, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>-like syndrome, recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory loss</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> were common initial complaints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In some, these symptoms progressed rapidly to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> but was indolent in others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Progression was faster in those with splenectomy and higher platelet counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MRI showed enhanced signal in subcortical, periventricular areas, consistent with ischemic small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Compared to patient controls, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was less frequent and platelet activation (increased <z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMP</z:chebi>, CD62p) was more frequent in the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic complications may occur in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, manifested as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>-like syndrome or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory loss</z:hpo> due to ischemic small vessel disease, progressing to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Memory disturbances</z:e> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005818" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">platelet disorders</z:e> warrants further investigation </plain></SENT>
