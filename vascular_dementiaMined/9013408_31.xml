<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> concentration in patients with ATD was found to be significantly lower than in controls (73%, p &lt; 0.0001), and showed a significant positive correlation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> scale scores (rs = 0.63, p &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Ch concentration in the CSF of ATD patients was approximately the same as in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In VDBT/MSID patients, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> concentration was significantly lower than in controls (p &lt; 0.001) also showing a significant positive correlation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> scale scores (rs = 0.62, p &lt; 0.02), but was significantly higher than in ATD patients (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the Ch concentration in VDBT/MSID patients was significantly higher than in controls (p &lt; 0.001) or ATD patients (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that simultaneous determination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> and Ch concentrations in CSF may be useful for differentiating VDBT/MSID from ATD and that increasing the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> level using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38323">cholinergic agents</z:chebi> may be a beneficial therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ATD as well as VDBT/MSIT, and is worthy of further investigation </plain></SENT>
