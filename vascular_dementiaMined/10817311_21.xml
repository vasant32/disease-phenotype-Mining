<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Primary family caregivers of 39 DAT and 40 VD patients who were being considered for relocation into group-living units were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total caregiving burden and different aspects of the burden: general strain, isolation, disappointment, and emotional involvement, were correlated with the patients' diagnoses, abilities, and symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Closer kinship to the patient imposed a heavier burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The caregiver's gender, social class, and previous institutionalization of the patient did not influence the caregiver burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between the patients' ADL ability or cognition and the burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A higher level of disappointment was found among the VD carers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Different symptomatology in patients of the two diagnostic groups was related to special aspects of the burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis showed that the amount of caregiving time each week and impaired sense of own identity, misidentifications, clinical fluctuations, and nocturnal deterioration in the patients predicted the breaking-point </plain></SENT>
