<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the volume of the nucleus caudatus as a neuroanatomical substrate of fronto-subcortical circuits, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with/without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and the relationship to potential determinants of neural circuit integrity such as white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> only (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>) (n=19) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) (n=16) and healthy control (n=20) subjects, matched on demographic variables, underwent extensive neuropsychiatric assessments and manual MRI-based volumetric measurements for intracranial area (ICA), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume, and bilateral caudate volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>WMH on MRI were quantified using an automated algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis of covariance (controlling for age and ICA), revealed that across the three groups, caudate volumes were significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in bilateral caudate nucleus volume between subjects by diagnosis (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>, VaD, control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The control group was largest in overall mean volume of the diagnostic groups, followed by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> group (86% of controls), and finally, the VaD group (72%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a partial correlation between total caudate volume and the total volume of deep WMH including periventricular regions and brainstem, controlling for ICA; and for total <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> patients with VaD have smaller caudate nuclei compared to those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and healthy controls, with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-only patients being intermediate in their caudate volume status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was preliminary evidence of negative correlation of caudate volume with volume of deep WMH and total <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume, suggesting cerebrovascular disease contributes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002340'>caudate atrophy</z:hpo>,which, in turn may disrupt fronto-subcortical circuits </plain></SENT>
