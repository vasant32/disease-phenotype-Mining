<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is also tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 23,000 cognitively impaired subjects from Norwegian institutions for the elderly were identified, and their files were checked against the records of 26,000 twin pairs from the Norwegian Twin Register </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A sample of 72 twin pairs was selected and thoroughly investigated clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the sample was 80 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The pairwise concordance rate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> was 78% (7/9) among monozygotic and 39% (9/23) among dizygotic twin pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The probandwise concordance rate was 83% (10/12) among monozygotic and 46% (12/26) among dizygotic twin pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the rate of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E epsilon 4 allele between twin pairs concordant and discordant for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By using tetrachoric correlations, the estimated heritability was approximately 0.6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Environmental factors shared by cotwins seemed to explain most of the remaining variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, there was no significant difference in pairwise concordance rates among monozygotic (1/6 [17%]) and dizygotic (4/16 [25%]) twin pairs or in probandwise concordance rates among monozygotic (2/7 [29%]) and dizygotic (5/17 [29%]) twin pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Heredity is the major causal factor in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, whereas environmental factors dominate in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
