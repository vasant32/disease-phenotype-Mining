<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Data from 204 participants from the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing, who were diagnosed post-mortem using the histopathological criteria of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> (CERAD), were used to assess the validity of the clinical criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) of the 'National Institute of Neurological and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009460" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Communicative Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>/the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> and Related Disorders Association' (NINCDS/ADRDA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cases who had been diagnosed as NINCDS/ADRDA 'probable AD' in life were usually confirmed at autopsy, but half of the NINCDS/ADRDA 'negative' cases were not (low specificity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was hypothesized that the overall clinical impression may have taken precedence over the use of the actual criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the validity and reliability of the clinical criteria using a computerized '<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnosis system' for each of 6 sets of criteria [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV), NINCDS/ADRDA and three sets of criteria specifically for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD): NINCDS-AIREN, State of California <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Diagnostic and Treatment Centers (ADDTC), and Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive Impairment</z:hpo> (VCI)] to classify a subset (n = 96) of the cases confirmed post-mortem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The use of the computerized system significantly (p = 0.01) increased the specificity (81%, similar to sensitivity) of the NINCDS/ADRDA diagnoses, which were shown to have 'moderate' inter-rater reliability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV criteria had good validity for AD when compared with post-mortem confirmation and showed 'substantial' inter-rater reliability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ADDTC and VCI criteria for VaD had good specificity (88%) and sensitivity (75%), but only for one rater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV and NINCDS-AIREN criteria for VaD showed poor validity and inter-rater reliability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the forced use of decision trees through a computerized system enhances the accuracy of the clinical diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
