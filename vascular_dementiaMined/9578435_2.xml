<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it was examined whether a correlation exists between impairment in choice accuracy in the T-maze and neuron loss in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In two experiments, male Mongolian gerbils were tested in a previously learned delayed alternation T-maze task 1 week after a 4 min occlusion of the common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both experiments memory was significantly impaired and in the second experiment, where the design allowed a separation between working and reference <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e>, a selective impairment in working memory was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced disruption of delayed alternation in the T-maze in gerbils is a model which is relevant to the clinical manifestations of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
