<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>L-3-n-butylphthalide (L-NBP), an extract from seeds of Apium graveolens Linn (Chinese celery), has been demonstrated to have neuroprotective effects on ischemic, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and amyloid-beta (Abeta)-infused animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we examined the effects of L-NBP on learning and memory in a triple-transgenic AD mouse model (3xTg-AD) that develops both plaques and tangles with aging, as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten-month-old 3xTg-AD mice were given 15 mg/kg L-NBP by oral gavage for 18 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>L-NBP treatment significantly improved learning deficits, as well as long-term spatial memory, compared with vehicle control treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>L-NBP treatment significantly reduced total cerebral Abeta plaque deposition and lowered Abeta levels in brain homogenates but had no effect on fibrillar Abeta plaques, suggesting preferential removal of diffuse Abeta deposits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found that L-NBP markedly enhanced soluble amyloid precursor protein secretion (alphaAPPs), alpha-secretase, and PKCalpha expression but had no effect on steady-state full-length APP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, L-NBP may direct APP processing toward a non-amyloidogenic pathway and preclude Abeta formation in the 3xTg-AD mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effect of l-NBP on regulating APP processing was further confirmed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> SK-N-SH cells overexpressing <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> human APP(695) (SK-N-SH APPwt) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>L-NBP treatment in 3xTg-AD mice also reduced glial activation and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> compared with control treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>L-NBP shows promising preclinical potential as a multitarget drug for the prevention and/or treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
