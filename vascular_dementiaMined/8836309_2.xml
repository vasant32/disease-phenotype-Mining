<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multicentre, parallel groups, double-blind clinical study vs placebo was carried out with patients suffering from probable vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> according to the NINDS-AIREN criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study consisted of a two-week run-in of a once daily, orally administered, placebo phase, followed by 12 weeks of intramuscular treatment with posatirelin 10 mg/ml or placebo given once a day and a follow-up after one month's withdrawal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Efficacy was assessed using the Gottfries-Bråne-Steen (GBS) Rating Scale for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, the Randt Memory Test and the Toulouse-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e>éron Attention Test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were evaluated using analysis of variance and covariance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As regards GBS scores, patients treated with posatirelin showed a significant improvement in intellectual performance, in orientation, motivation and memory as compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The improvement of memory performance was also confirmed by the acquisition score and memory index of the Randt Memory Test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the end of the follow-up period the differences between treatments were still maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tolerability was good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The significant improvement observed in cognitive functions, attention and motivation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients treated with posatirelin suggests the potential usefulness of this drug in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the presence of a long-lasting effect after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">drug withdrawal</z:e> suggests the possibility of administering the drug cyclically </plain></SENT>
