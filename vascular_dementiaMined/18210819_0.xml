<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Impairment of the basic functions of attention and executive function was confirmed, as opposed to impairment in the cognitive domain itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings showed a pattern close to that of healthy persons in their 80s, rather than that of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679466" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deficit</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of the longitudinal study showed more progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679466" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deficit</z:e> when the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rating was 0.5 in domains other than memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No effects of lifestyle, internal diseases or psychosocial intervention were confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, generally low cognitive function and general <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> were involved, whereas frontal lobe function, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the frontal and temporal lobes, white matter changes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> were related to progression to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Excessive dependence on primary prevention should be avoided for aged patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>; rather, secondary prevention, using clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rating, psychological testing and MRI are desirable </plain></SENT>
