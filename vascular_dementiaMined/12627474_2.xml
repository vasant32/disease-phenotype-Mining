<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have suggested the involvement of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), as exons 16 and 17 of the APP gene mutations have been found in some familial AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, overexpression and deposition of the beta amyloid <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, a proteolytic product of APP, have been considered as a pathological hallmark of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is of particular interest to determine the expression of APP gene at the transcription level for better understanding of the roles of APP gene in AD pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this work, we employed the quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to quantify APP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcripts in the peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PMBC) of 52 Alzheimer's patients, 28 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) patients, and 60 healthy elderly controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the amount (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) of APP transcripts per microgram of total cDNA was 4.05 +/- 0.27, 2.73 +/- 0.33, and 2.59 +/- 0.27 amole in AD, VD, and healthy controls, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase (P &lt; 0.05) in the expression of APP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcripts in AD compared with that in VD or in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, our data indicated that variation of APP gene expression in PMBC might be a pathogenic source of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
