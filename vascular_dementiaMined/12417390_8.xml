<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hyperintense white matter areas detected by T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represent lesions, also termed leukoaraiosis that are very common in VaD as well as in other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the role of white matter changes in the cognitive and memory decline that occurs in VaD patients is still under debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High-b DWI, analyzed using the q-space approach, is a more sensitive MRI method for detection of white matter changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High-b DWI revealed massive white matter loss in VaD patients that surpassed the boundaries of T2 hyperintensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This technique, therefore, might serve as a better indication for the extensive nerve fiber loss in the white matter that is caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
