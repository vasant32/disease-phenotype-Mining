<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the long-term prospective association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, a nonspecific marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data are from the cohort of Japanese American men who were seen in the second examination of the Honolulu Heart Program (1968-1970) and subsequently were reexamined 25 years later for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study (1991-1996) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a random subsample of 1,050 Honolulu-Asia Aging Study cases and noncases, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentrations were measured from serum taken at the second examination; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was assessed in a clinical examination that included neuroimaging and neuropsychological testing and was evaluated using international criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with men in the lowest quartile (&lt;0.34mg/L) of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, men in the upper three quartiles had a 3-fold significantly increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> combined, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, the risk increased with increasing quartile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These relations were independent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data support the view that inflammatory markers may reflect not only peripheral disease, but also cerebral disease mechanisms related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and that these processes are measurable long before clinical symptoms appear </plain></SENT>
