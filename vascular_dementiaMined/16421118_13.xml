<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The spectrum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1392786" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive alterations</z:e> associated with CADASIL, a model of pure vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, has not been thoroughly evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were: (i) to describe the cognitive profile in CADASIL patients according to age; (ii) to compare the profile of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with that of patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; and (iii) to determine the association between alterations in performance in different cognitive domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty two consecutive individuals with CADASIL (35-73 years old) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cognitive skills were analysed in five domains (executive functions, reasoning, attention, memory, visuospatial abilities) according to age and compared between patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Associations between cognitive performance and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The youngest patients presented with attention (69%), memory (70%), and executive disturbances (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Visuospatial abilities and reasoning deteriorated with age, mainly after the age of 60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>About one quarter of patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 75% of these were &gt;60 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age &gt;60 years was associated with a Rankin score &gt;3 and a significant deficit in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cognitive domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No association was found between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and the number of ischaemic attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Episodic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025261" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory disorder</z:e> was characterised by difficulties in retrieval rather than impairment of the encoding process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>Cognitive decline</z:hpo> in CADASIL is dominated by early impairment of executive functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Skills in other cognitive domains deteriorate with age and are found to be diffusely impaired in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The relative preservation of the encoding process in episodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo>, even in individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, is noteworthy </plain></SENT>
