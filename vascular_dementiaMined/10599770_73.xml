<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest women have a higher risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> than men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, these studies include small sample sizes, particularly in the older age groups, when the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is highest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Pooled analysis of four population-based prospective cohort studies was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sample included persons 65 years and older, 528 incident cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 28,768 person-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incident cases were identified in a two-stage procedure in which the total cohort was screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, and screen positives underwent detailed diagnostic assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> and main subtypes of AD and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were diagnosed according to internationally accepted guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sex- and age-specific incidence rates, and relative and cumulative risks for total <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, AD, and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were calculated using log linear analysis and Poisson regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were significant gender differences in the incidence of AD after age 85 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 90 years of age, the rate was 81.7 (95% CI, 63.8 to 104.7) in women and 24.0 (95% CI, 10.3 to 55.6) in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no gender differences in rates or risk for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The cumulative risk for 65-year-old women to develop AD at the age of 95 years was 0.22 compared with 0.09 for men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The cumulative risk for developing vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at the age of 95 years was similar for men and women (0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Compared with men, women have an increased risk for AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There are no gender differences in risk for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
