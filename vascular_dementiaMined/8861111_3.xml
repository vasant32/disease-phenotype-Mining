<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After 6 weeks of hypoperfusion, mACh-R binding activity was significantly reduced in the frontal cortex (79.0 percent, P &lt;0.01), striatum (74.2 percent, P &lt; 0.01) and hippocampus (78.6 percent, P &lt; 0.01), and the m1-R <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in the frontal cortex (86.6 percent, P &lt; 0.05) and striatum (89.4 percent, P &lt; 0.05) compared with sham-operated control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Repeated administration of bifemelane <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> (15 mg/kg/day, p.o., once a day from the day of operation for 6 weeks) prevented the hypoperfusion-induced loss of mACh-R binding and m1-R <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels above described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since the central cholinergic systems play an important role in learning and memory, these findings suggest that bifemelane <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> is useful to treat and/or prevent vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> which is closely related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
