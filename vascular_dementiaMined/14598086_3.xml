<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined a consecutive patient sample referred to our center for diagnostic assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CSF tau and Abeta42 were assayed each week as routine neurochemical analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 119 patients investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These included 61 with probable AD (35 mild AD, 26 severe AD), 24 with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI), 14 with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 11 with Lewy body <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 9 with fronto-temporal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mild AD showed significantly lower CSF Abeta42 levels and significantly higher CSF tau levels than the other diagnostic groups; 79% of MCI patients had pathological values for both biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We confirm that these biomarkers have a role in the clinical work-up of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
