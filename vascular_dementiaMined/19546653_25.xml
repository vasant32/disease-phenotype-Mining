<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The relationships between alcohol consumption and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> were investigated in a systematic review including meta-analyses of 15 prospective studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Follow-ups ranged from 2 to 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Meta-analyses were conducted on samples including 14,646 participants evaluated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD), 10,225 participants evaluated for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), and 11,875 followed for any type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (Any <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pooled relative risks (RRs) of AD, VaD, and Any <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> for light to moderate drinkers compared with nondrinkers were 0.72 (95% CI = 0.61-0.86), 0.75 (95% CI = 0.57-0.98), and 0.74 (95% CI = 0.61-0.91), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the more generally classified "drinkers," were compared with "nondrinkers," they had a reduced risk of AD (RR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.47-0.94) and Any <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (RR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.53-0.82) but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were not enough data to examine VaD risk among "drinkers." Those classified as heavy drinkers did not have an increased risk of Any <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> compared with nondrinkers, but this may reflect sampling bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that alcohol drinkers in late life have reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is unclear whether this reflects selection effects in cohort studies commencing in late life, a protective effect of alcohol consumption throughout adulthood, or a specific benefit of alcohol in late life </plain></SENT>
