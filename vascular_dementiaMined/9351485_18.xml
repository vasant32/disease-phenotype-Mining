<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates were available from the Registrar General for Scotland for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>/presenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD PSD) or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) who had died in Scotland up until 31 December 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary (immediate and underlying) and contributory causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were noted as well as place of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Occupations of male patients were obtained from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates or from case notes and classified according to the Standard Occupational Classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006285" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Bronchopneumonia</z:e> was considered a non-specific cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and specific causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were classified as: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, cerebrovascular disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> and other diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Place of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was recorded as psychiatric hospital, district general hospital, nursing home or private residence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates of 398 people who had been treated for AD PSD and 348 who had been treated for VaD were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006285" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Bronchopneumonia</z:e> was the most common immediate cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the AD PSD group (70.9%) but less so for the VaD group (51.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For both groups place of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was associated with significant differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> being reported as the immediate cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as well as specific underlying and contributory causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was recorded for 90.5% of AD PSD patients but for only 49.7% of the VaD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Scottish <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificate data significantly underestimate the prevalence of presenile VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Changes in patterns of institutional care may affect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rates estimated from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificate data </plain></SENT>
