<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of CADASIL is based on typical clinical presentation and characteristic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes, and has to be confirmed by biopsy of the sural nerve, muscle and skin, as well as by genetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations within the Notch3 gene were identified as the underlying genetic defect in CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE OUTLINE: The clinical manifestations of the first presented patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> from the age of thirteen, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> without vascular risk factors and stepwise progression of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> comprising the typical clinical picture of CADASIL, were confirmed after seven years with pathological verification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second presented case did not satisfy the clinical criteria for CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>His <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was considered to be related with vascular risk factors--<z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aetiological diagnosis was established only when his brother without vascular risk factors presented with similar clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Until the development of the new neuroimaging techniques like MRI, pathologic and genetic analysis, CADASIL was considered as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the increasing number of CADASIL families has been identified throughout the world showing that this entity is usually underdiagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This article presents three patients from two Serbian families with clinical suspicion of CADASIL verified by pathologic examination </plain></SENT>
