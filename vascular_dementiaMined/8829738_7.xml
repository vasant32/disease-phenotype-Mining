<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We have ascertained the treated incidence of AD PSD in Scotland by scrutiny of hospital cassenotes and searched for cases outside hospital settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Small area geographical analysis compared the observed distribution of cases (each allocated to one of Scotland's 898 postcode sectors) with the estimated random distribution of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was non-random geographical distribution of AD PSD but not of the comparison conditions (vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085084" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">motor neurone disease</z:e>, prostatic or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancers</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Substantial differences between Scottish regions were probably not attributable to methodological artefact, as other techniques of case finding showed the same regional differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The observed differences in incidence of AD PSD between Scotland's regions are real and some localities have a higher incidence, mostly in central Scotland </plain></SENT>
