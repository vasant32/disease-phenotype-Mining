<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of non-suppression, defined according to Carroll's criterion was high in the pathological groups studied, and relatively high in controls, showing no diagnostic value </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More restrictive criteria for the definition of non-suppressors are proposed, in order to increase the specificity of the test when applied to psychogeriatrics </plain></SENT>
