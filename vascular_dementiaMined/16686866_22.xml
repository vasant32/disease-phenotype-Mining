<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) with multiple impaired cognitive domains (mcd-MCI) is a prodromal manifestation of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Geriatric unit of the Ospedale Maggiore Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Milan, Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred community-dwelling subjects aged 65 and older who came freely to the geriatric unit as part of a comprehensive geriatric assessment program were evaluated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> or other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009241" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects with MCI were kept under observation for 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Subjects with MCI were studied by applying a standardized clinical evaluation and a conducting a computed tomography brain scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cognitive performance was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Clock Drawing Test, and a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular comorbidity was assessed on the basis of medical history and using electrocardiography, echocardiography, and carotid color Doppler ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MCI was found in 65 of the 400 community-dwelling subjects; 31 were classified with amnestic MCI (a-MCI) and 34 with mcd-MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A dysexecutive syndrome characterized people with mcd-MCI, who had significantly more vascular comorbidity and signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> on brain imaging as well as a higher prevalence of extra pyramidal features, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0525045" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mood disorders</z:e>, and behavioral symptoms than people with a-MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty of the 65 subjects with MCI (31%) progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> within 3 years of follow-up: 11 subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and nine with VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who evolved to AD had been classified with a-MCI at baseline, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who evolved to subcortical VaD had been classified with mcd-MCI at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects who converted to subcortical VaD had been classified with mcd-MCI, suggesting that mcd-MCI might be an early stage of subcortical VaD </plain></SENT>
