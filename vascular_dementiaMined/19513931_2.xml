<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two individuals with mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (30 with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>; two with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On average, participants learned the associations in fewer than four sessions and retained the information for variable amounts of time, up to 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previously known associations were learned significantly faster than new associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The modified SRT format, in which the within-session recall intervals were filled with information related to the target association, did not result in faster learning or longer retention of learned associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants learned previously known associations in the standard SRT format (with unrelated information in the recall intervals) significantly faster than new associations taught in the modified SRT condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination, was significantly correlated with time to learn new associations, but did not explain a large proportion of the variance in new learning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed </plain></SENT>
