<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> is more prevalent in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subjects for these studies were either psychiatry or neurology patients, raising the issue of whether factors leading to treatment might have introduced sampling bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data for the present study came from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA, 1994), a population-based prevalence study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AD was diagnosed using NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (McKhann et al., 1984), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was diagnosed using draft <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10 criteria (World Health Organization, 1987) and the Ischemic Scale (Hachinski et al., 1975), major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was diagnosed using an algorithm based on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 1987) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sample for the present study consisted of 481 subjects with AD and 140 with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The weighted prevalence rate of major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was 3.2% for AD and 21.2% for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, giving a crude odds ratio of 8.2 (95% Confidence Interval: 1.7-40.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding was confirmed by a logistic regression analysis which adjusted for age, sex, place of residence (community, institution), self-reported health, severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, and antidepressant or beta-blocker use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Data on depressive symptoms were more often missing in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> resulting in differential loss of potential study subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Data on depressive symptoms were not sufficiently detailed to permit <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R criteria to be implemented rigorously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The method of diagnosing vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was subject to misclassification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms in a population sample that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> is more prevalent in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> compared to AD </plain></SENT>
