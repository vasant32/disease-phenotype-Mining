<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to detect and identify the characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> during the early stage of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subjects consisted of 23 consecutive first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> patients who were admitted to the Department of Neurology, Kaohsiung Municipal Hsiao-Kang Hospital, Taiwan, from November 2001 to October 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale and Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) were used to evaluate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity and cognitive function, and assessments were performed by a neurologist and psychologist, within 10 days of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 23 patients, 21 (91.3%) had CASI scores below their respective cutoff values and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in at least one cognitive domain in CASI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant correlations between CASI abnormality (below the cutoff value) and patient age, education, or the interval from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> was the most often impaired cognitive domain on CASI (19 patients, 82.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were significant correlations between recent memory and "attention or concentration"(correlation coefficient, 0.52; p &lt; 0.05), and "abstraction and judgment" (correlation coefficient, 0.44; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The correlations between recent memory and other domains were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> is quite common and recent memory is the most often impaired cognitive domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This may have been caused by the location of the specific lesion as well as by the impairment in "attention or concentration" or "abstraction and judgment" </plain></SENT>
