<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Silent cerebrovascular disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) has been proposed as a predisposing condition for clinically overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we found increased thrombin generation in silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the effect of thrombin inhibition using a potent selective thrombin inhibitor on the cerebral metabolism and function in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306889" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">peripheral arterial occlusive disease</z:e> (PAOD) patients with or without silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined 17 mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> PAOD patients, including 2 cases of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We divided the patients into 2 groups: 1 was the advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> group with multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> and/or advanced periventricular hyperintensity detected by brain MRI (n=12), and the other was the no <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> group that had none of these abnormalities (n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We assessed the cerebral biochemical compounds in the deep white matter area and cerebellar hemisphere (8 cm3) by proton <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy before and after infusion of argatroban (10 mg/d IV) over 2 hours for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ratio of N-acetylasparate (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>) to total <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> (Cre) in the deep white matter area was significantly lower in the advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> group than in the no <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> group, whereas there were no significant differences in this ratio in the cerebellar hemisphere between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the former group, this decreased <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cre ratio significantly increased after argatroban therapy, whereas there was no change in the latter group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 2 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> showed clinical improvement with marked increases in the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cre ratio and mini-mental score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that increased thrombin generation may have some pathophysiological roles in developing vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and its <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> predisposing conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thrombin inhibition may break this vicious cycle and lead to clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
