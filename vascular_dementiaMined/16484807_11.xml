<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CSF levels were determined in patients with AD (n = 109), mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI, n = 25), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (n = 15), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD, n = 41), and controls (n = 58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CSF NfH(SMI35) was elevated in AD and VD as compared to controls (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total tau was higher in AD as compared to controls (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSF phospho-tau was elevated in AD as compared to controls and VD (p &lt; 0.05 each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CSF Abeta42 and Abeta ratios in AD were lower than in MCI and controls (p &lt; 0.05 each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The diagnostic potential of NfH(SMI35) is not superior to that of other CSF markers </plain></SENT>
