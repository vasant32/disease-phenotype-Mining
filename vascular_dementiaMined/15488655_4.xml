<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The three common forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> in the elderly include <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These disorders are distinguished by their specific pathological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, overlapping clinical and imaging features in a given case are not too uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on alterations in CSF dynamics study, a unifying concept in the pathogenesis of AD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> has been proposed recently which may have therapeutic implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Altered CSF dynamics by affecting the absorptive process may lead to hydrocephalic change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This may also affect clearance of amyloid protein leading to increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath> in brain parenchyma resulting in AD pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hence it is likely that a subgroup of patients may have an AD-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> syndrome who may be benefitted by CSF drainage procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present author attempts to extend this concept to hypothesise a unifying concept to explain the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the three disorders which may explain overlapping features observed clinically and in neuroimaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is surmised that altered CSF dynamics and hypoperfusion from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> may be interlinked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The defective clearance of amyloid may also lead to amyloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> perpetuating hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hypoperfusion may also affect formation as well as absorption of CSF altering clearance of amyloid and promoting vascular and parenchymal deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus the pathologies of AD, VaD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> get interrelated </plain></SENT>
