<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Accurate distinction between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtypes is important for patient care and pharmacological treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Continuing systematic comparisons of clinical and neuropathological <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnoses may provide a basis for further improvement of the diagnostic procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate concordance between clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnosis and neuropathological findings in the specialized <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Inclusion required 1) a clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> disorder diagnosed at a hospital-based memory clinic and 2) a neuropathological examination within the Department of Pathology at the University Hospital in Lund, Sweden, during the years 1996-2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 176 consecutive patients fulfilled the criteria and were thus included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnoses were obtained from the medical records and compared with the neuropathological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The clinical and pathological <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnoses were in full accordance in 86 (49%) of the patients (kappa 0.37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In an additional 24 (14%) cases, the clinical diagnosis corresponded with some but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pathological components judged to contribute to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, 84% (46/55) had a significant Alzheimer component with or without other significant pathology at neuropathological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The corresponding figure for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) was 59% (24/41), for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> 74% (20/27), for combined Alzheimer and VaD 25% (4/16), and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> 67% (6/9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> diagnoses do not always correspond with neuropathological changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It stresses the importance of neuropathological examination in research and in daily clinical practice </plain></SENT>
