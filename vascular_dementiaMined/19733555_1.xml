<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The two most common forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the overlap of biochemical processes which have been identified in AD and VaD, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> is believed to contribute to the numerous pathologies of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: This study assessed oxidative damage in total plasma proteins, and isolated <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> in AD patients and age matched controls, in addition total <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> capacity (<z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi>) was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly higher <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> protein carbonylation was observed in AD compared to age-matched controls (AD: 4.17+/-0.73 vs. control: 3.85+/-0.86 nmol/mg <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>; p=0.05, 2-tailed Mann-Whitney), in addition to reduced <z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi> (AD: 924.708+/-174.429 vs. control: 1078.536+/-252.633 microM; p=0.001, 2-tailed Mann-Whitney) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No differences were seen in total plasma protein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi> content (AD: 3.88+/-0.31 vs. control: 3.98+/-0.48 nmol/mg protein) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results further support the view that oxidation events in AD may be specific in nature, and represent functional changes to proteins, rather than random global events </plain></SENT>
