<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative assessment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16830">methylamine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38472">acetonitrile</z:chebi> in tissues has been hampered due to the volatility and hydrolipophilicity of these <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amines</z:chebi> as well as interference by complex biological constituents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have overcome this problem and developed an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48605">FMOC</z:chebi>/HPLC (9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate-Cl/high-performance liquid chromatography) method for simultaneous assessment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16830">methylamine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17906">aminoacetone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This method has been validated using rodent tissues with a detection limit at the picogram level </plain></SENT>
