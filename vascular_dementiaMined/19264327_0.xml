<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This rapid process of aging is causing an increasing burden on the social and health-care services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this context, the precise knowledge of the environmental, socio-economical and clinical characteristics of the elderly population is mandatory to find the correct strategies to achieve the successful aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our study aimed to investigate the functional and clinical characteristics of the elderly (aged 60 to 85 years) of San Teodoro (1500 inhabitants), a rural village of Central Sicily, in particularly considering the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> prevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 2005, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the elderly between 60 and 85 years old were invited to participate to the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The list of the potential participants was obtained from the Registry office of the municipality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The final number of the eligible subjects was 374 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rate of participation was 74.9% (280 subjects, 120 M and 160 F) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study was conducted door-to-door </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> prevalence was 7.1% (20 subjects, 8 M and 12 F), with 60% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and 15% vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, slightly higher than that of the European countries (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The high prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (80.3%) and the low education level, two important risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, could explain in part the difference observed </plain></SENT>
