<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: White matter lesion (WML) progression has been advocated as a surrogate marker in intervention trials on cerebral small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the rate of visually rated WML progression, studied correlations between lesion progression and cognition, and estimated sample sizes for clinical trials with pure WML progression vs combined WML progression-cognitive outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Those 394 participants of the Leukoaraiosis and Disability Study (LADIS) study with magnetic resonance imaging scanning at baseline and 3-year follow-up were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>WML progression rating relied on the modified Rotterdam Progression Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Assessment Scale global score and a composite score of specific executive function tests assessed longitudinal change in cognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sample size calculations were based on the assumption that treatment reduces WML progression by 1 grade on the Rotterdam Progression Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: WML progression related to deterioration in cognitive functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This relationship was less pronounced in subjects with early confluent and confluent lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consequently, studies in which the outcome is <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1392786" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive change</z:e> resulting from treatment effects on lesion progression will need between 1809 subjects per treatment arm when using executive tests and up to 18 853 subjects when using the Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Assessment Scale score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Studies having WML progression as the sole outcome will need only 58 or 70 individuals per treatment arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: WML progression is an interesting outcome for proof-of-concept studies in cerebral small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>If cognitive outcome measures are added to protocols, then sample size estimates increase substantially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data support the use of an executive test battery rather than the Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Assessment Scale as the primary cognitive outcome measure </plain></SENT>
