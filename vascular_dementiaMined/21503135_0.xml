<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: CADASIL is a genetic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> caused by mutations in the Notch 3 gene on Chromosome 19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1281300" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular degeneration</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We characterized upstream components of Notch signaling pathways that may be disrupted in CADASIL, by measuring expression of insulin, IGF-1, and IGF-2 receptors, Notch 1, Notch 3, and aspartyl-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22656,32664">asparaginyl</z:chebi>)-Î²-hydroxylase (AAH) in cortex and white matter from 3 CADASIL and 6 control brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed CADASIL-associated cell loss by measuring <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> corresponding to neurons, oligodendroglia, and astrocytes, and indices of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1281300" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular degeneration</z:e> by measuring smooth muscle actin (SMA) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) expression in isolated vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining was used to assess SMA degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant abnormalities including reduced cerebral white matter <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of Notch 1, Notch 3, AAH, SMA, IGF receptors, myelin-associated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi>, and glial fibrillary acidic protein, and reduced vascular expression of SMA, IGF receptors, Notch 1 and Notch 3 were detected in CADASIL-lesioned brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found CADASIL-associated reductions in SMA, and increases in ubiquitin immunoreactivity in the media of white matter and meningeal vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No abnormalities in gene expression or immunoreactivity were observed in CADASIL cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Molecular abnormalities in CADASIL are largely restricted to white matter and white matter vessels, corresponding to the distribution of neuropathological lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These preliminary findings suggest that CADASIL is mediated by both glial and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1281300" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular degeneration</z:e> with reduced expression of IGF receptors and AAH, which regulate Notch expression and function </plain></SENT>
