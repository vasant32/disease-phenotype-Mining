<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In AD and VD the white matter content of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and cholesterol was reduced to 72-76% of the control values (P less than 0.01), the diminution of cerebrosides and sulphatides was more pronounced (55-69%) (P less than 0.001) while the concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">gangliosides</z:chebi> did not change significantly (87-90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The myelin composition was the same in the 3 groups, suggesting that the white matter involvement is not caused by alteration of the myelin structure </plain></SENT>
