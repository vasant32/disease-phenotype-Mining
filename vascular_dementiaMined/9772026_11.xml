<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Tau is the main protein of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>paired helical filaments</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It can be detected and measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and for this reason it has been proposed as a possible in vivo marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the usefulness of CSF tau in the diagnosis of AD we measured it in patients with AD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000727'>frontal lobe dementia</z:hpo> (FLD), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), and in healthy controls by means of a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Individuals with AD had significantly higher tau levels than FLD, VD, and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> AD had significantly higher levels than those with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In AD, CSF tau level did not correlate with age, duration, or severity of the disease, whereas a correlation with age was found in FLD and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the nine AD patients in whom CSF tau measurement was repeated after 2 years, mean levels did not differ from baseline, although a worsening of cognitive performances occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overlap among the different groups and the absence of any modification over time suggest that CSF tau measurement, more than in confirming or staging overt AD, might be useful in revealing the disease at its preclinical phase </plain></SENT>
