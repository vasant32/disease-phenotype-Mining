<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The goal of this study is to determine patterns of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35471">psychotropic drug</z:chebi> use (PDU), the association with neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), and the variability across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> types in nursing home residents with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, PDU was analyzed across multiple indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study over a two-year period from 2006 to 2008, which involved 14 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> special care units in nine nursing homes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 117 residents with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> participated in the study, of whom 35% had Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD) and 11% vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PDU was classified according to anatomical therapeutic chemical-classification as either "present" or "absent" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The majority of residents had moderately severe to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> successive assessments, almost two-thirds of residents received any <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35471">psychotropic drug</z:chebi> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) and almost one-third continued to receive any <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDs</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi> (APs) were prescribed most frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fewer residents started with antidepressants, but continued to receive antidepressants at higher percentages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35474">Anxiolytics</z:chebi> showed an intermittent course, but a subgroup of 9% showed two-year continuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Once started on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDs</z:e> at baseline, residents continued to use <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDs</z:e> at high percentages: three-quarters continued to receive APs for at least six months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Half of residents received at least one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>; one-fifth received at least two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDs</z:e> simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Residents with AD received more <z:chebi fb="6" ids="35717">hypnotics</z:chebi> and antidementia drugs; residents with VaD received more <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi>, antidepressants, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35474">anxiolytics</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDs</z:e> have different utilization patterns, but overall, consistently high continuation rates were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results warrant scrutiny of continuous PDU </plain></SENT>
