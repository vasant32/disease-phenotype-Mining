<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The role of cerebrovascular disease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in older people has been the subject of controversy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to examine the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> in a prospective autopsy series of patients with clinically diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Structured review of clinical and neuropathological examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical diagnoses were assigned in accordance with the recommendations of the NINCDS/ADRDA consensus panel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuropathological examinations were performed at an academic neuropathology service using published consensus criteria for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and other forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A subspecialty, outpatient <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> clinic in a university-affiliated suburban American hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-seven unselected patients coming to autopsy who had undergone clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> could not be attributed to the effects of cerebrovascular disease alone in any of the 87 patients coming to autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six (87%) of the patients were found to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), 44 had AD alone, and 32 had AD in combination with cerebrovascular disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients with signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> at autopsy were also found to have some concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The absence of patients in whom vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> could be diagnosed at neuropathology was not the result of recruitment bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion of AD or other neurodegenerative process in older patients whose presenting complaint is <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, even in the presence of well documented cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
