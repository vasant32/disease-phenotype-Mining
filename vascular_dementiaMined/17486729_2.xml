<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few studies have examined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and their association with VD in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a case-control study using a sampling of subjects from the outpatient memory clinics of two hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Identified cases were those patients diagnosed with VD based on the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The controls were subjects with Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating Scale as 0, i.e. no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> from the same <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> registry database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exposure was recorded by means of a risk factor questionnaire or medical examination </plain></SENT>
