<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, cortical infarction, and subcortical ischemic vasculopathy have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> been associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The interrelationships between these pathologies and their independent contributions to cognitive function remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite the high frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) in those with clinically diagnosed vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and the frequent findings of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> in those with clinically diagnosed AD, many studies of brain-behavior relationships in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> consider these populations separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study sought to identify the correlates of independent domains of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in an unselected sample across a large range of severity and overlap of AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred five individuals from the Sunnybrook <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Study recruited from a university Memory clinic had detailed neuropsychological testing and MRI quantification using a multi-step postprocessing algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A factor analysis of the cognitive protocol yielded a 3-factor solution, provisionally labeled: (1) short-term memory and language, (2) attention and working memory, and (3) mental flexibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A factor analysis of brain measures identified 3 independent factors with measures of (1) brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, (2) subcortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, and (3) strategic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (anterior-medial thalamus and cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After accounting for the effects of age and education, measures of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> were the strongest correlates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cognitive domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Small vessel disease was independently associated with general severity, impaired short-term memory/language, and reduced mental flexibility, but not with poor working memory, presumably through disruption of frontal-subcortical connections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, strategic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> to anterior-medial thalamus and cortical gray matter were associated with poor short-term and working memory, but not with impairments in mental flexibility or global severity measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data support the hypothesis that the thalamico-cortical network subserves both short-term and working memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The findings also suggest that each type of pathology (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, small vessel disease, and strategic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>) contribute independently to the pattern of cognitive disabilities associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Particular attention to cerebrovascular disease in deep white or gray matter structures of the thalamico-cortical system is certainly warranted </plain></SENT>
