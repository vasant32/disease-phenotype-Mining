<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the reliability and validity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Care Mapping-Japanese version (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>-J) has not yet been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the purpose of this research was to clarify the reliability and validity of the Well-being and Ill-being (WIB) value of the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>-J as a method for evaluating quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was conducted from April 1, 2005 to June 30, 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The participants included 130 elderly patients (men 31, women 99, average age 82.65+/-7.69 years) who were given a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We established inter-rater reliability during a parallel observation method and also used test-retest for reliability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The correlation between the WIB value of the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>-J and the Japanese Quality of Life Inventory for Elderly with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> (QOL-D) was used to establish criterion-related validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-nine (37.7%) subjects were given a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer's type, 80 (61.5%) had vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 1 (0.8%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results showed correlation between the WIB value and <z:mp ids='MP_0001361'>social withdrawal</z:mp> measured by the behavioral category code (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCC</z:e>) on the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>-J and the three subscales of QOL-D: "interacting with surroundings", "expressing self", and "experiencing minimum negative behaviors" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was good internal consistency among these items </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The interclass correlation coefficient was 82.32 (+/-5.85) for the WIB value of the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>-J </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The correlation coefficient of the retest, administered one week later, was 0.836 (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The WIB value was significantly correlated with three sub-scales of QOL-D, and the correlation coefficient was greater than 0.53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that the WIB value of the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>-J has good inter-rater reliability and test re-test reliability and criterion-related validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In this study, the WIB value was shown to have similar reliability to the WIB value of the original <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our results suggest that the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>-J could be useful for evaluating quality of life among elderly Japanese patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
