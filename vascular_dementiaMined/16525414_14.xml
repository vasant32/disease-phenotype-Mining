<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Univariate voxel-based analysis ignores the functional correlations among structures and may lack sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we applied a novel voxel-based multivariate technique to a large ((18)F)2-fluoro-2-deoxy-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4167">D-glucose</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography data set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sample consisted of 153 subjects, one-third each being probable subcortical VaD, probable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) (matched for Mini-Mental-State examination (MMSE) and age), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (NCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We first applied principal component (PC) analysis and removed PCs significantly correlated to age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remainders were used as feature vectors in a canonical variate analysis to generate canonical variates (CVs), that is, linear combinations of PC-scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first two CVs efficiently separated the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CV(1) separated VaD from AD with 100% accuracy, whereas CV(2) separated NC from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> subjects with 72% sensitivity and 96% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Images depicting CV(1) and CV(2) showed that lower metabolism differentiating VaD from AD mainly concerned the deep gray nuclei, cerebellum, primary cortices, middle temporal gyrus, and anterior cingulate gyrus, whereas lower metabolism in AD versus VaD concerned mainly the hippocampal region and orbitofrontal, posterior cingulate, and posterior parietal cortices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The hypometabolic pattern common to VaD and AD mainly concerned the posterior parietal, precuneus, posterior cingulate, prefrontal, and anterior hippocampal regions, and linearly correlated with the MMSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study shows the potential of voxel-based multivariate methods to highlight independent functional networks in dementing diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>By maximizing the separation between groups, this method extracted a metabolic pattern that efficiently differentiated VaD and AD </plain></SENT>
