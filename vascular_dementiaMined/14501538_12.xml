<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is impairment of immune function in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, and the perturbation of immune system is involved the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism of the impairment is unclear so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed telomerase activities of phytohemagglutinin-activated lymphocytes from 187 cases of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, 53 cases of patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 80 cases of age-matched healthy controls, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Telomerase activity was measured using the telomeric repeat amplification protocol-based telomerase polymerase chain reaction enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also detected the proliferation activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 10 cases of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> or 10 cases of age-matched healthy controls by [3H] <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Telomerase activity of phytohemagglutinin-activated lymphocytes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> patients was significantly elevated compared with healthy controls (P &lt; 0.01) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients (P &lt; 0.01), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was significant statistical correlation between the telomerase activities of lymphocytes and the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proliferation activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to phytohemagglutinin was significantly decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> patients compared with age-matched healthy controls (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that there could be an accelerated telomere dysfunction in lymphocytes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> patients, which induces the increase of telomerase activity and the decrease of proliferation activity of lymphocytes, and subsequently results in the impairment of immune function in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
