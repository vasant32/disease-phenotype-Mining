<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The purpose was to: (1) compare the prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms among patients with AD and VaD after controlling for demographic characteristics in difference setting and (2) rank and contrast the severity the common symptoms between the two groups in north of Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional comparative design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were collected from clinical interviews using three instruments: the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), the Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating Scale (CDR), and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 154 subjects participated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The male subjects with VaD from the outpatient setting had lower NPI scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the OPD, the subjects with AD had more nighttime behavior than subjects with VAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the nursing home setting, the subjects with VaD had higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo>, and appetite changes than subjects with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The subjects with AD had more euphoria and nighttime behavior than subjects with VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average of total NPI scores for people with AD and VaD from the nursing home setting indicate higher scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the nursing home group, the VaD subjects evidenced significantly higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo> scores than the AD subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This was first care unit based study in north Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results showed the significant differences between AD and VaD groups of NPI symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Understanding those differences may aid differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtypes and help develop proper interventions </plain></SENT>
