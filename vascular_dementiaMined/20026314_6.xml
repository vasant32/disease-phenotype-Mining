<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The concentration of plasma copper, ceruloplasmin (CRP), non-ceruloplasmin-bound Cu (NCBC), and metallothioneins (MTs) were studied as putative biomarkers for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> in patients and in their first-degree relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found increased levels of Cu in the plasma of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>), and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) patients, and the increase observed in VD group was linked to the evolution of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CRP was also elevated in response to the inflammatory component of the diseases, however, a correlation with illness progression was only observed in VD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The level of MTs is proportional to the evolution of VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Cu/CRP and Cu/MTs ratios are both indicative of disease progression for AD patients but not for those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> or VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there is a correlation between the NCBC levels and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> estimated through the Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This dependence is linear for AD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> patients and non-linear for the VD ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relative values of NCBC showed dependence on the disease duration, especially for AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Copper measurement and the Cu/CRP ratio may be predictive markers of risk for the first-degree relatives of AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We believe that these results are valuable as a reliable clinical tool </plain></SENT>
