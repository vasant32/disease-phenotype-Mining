<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although in recent decades the study of many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> has evolved greatly, the concept of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> still remains elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> are classified according to the major components of protein deposits, coexpression of several abnormal proteins in the brain tissue is more common than that was previously thought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this report is to describe the type of protein deposits found in brains with neuropathological diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The report shows the experience obtained in the Brain Bank of Navarra (Spain) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The target population for this retrospective descriptive study comprised 178 brains autopsied in the "Hospital of Navarra" in Pamplona between 1994 and 2004 and 201 brains donated to the Brain Bank of Pamplona between 2004 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of the 201 brains from the Brain Bank was 62 (30.8%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), 43 (21.3%) multiprotein deposit, 31 (15.4%) α-synucleinopathies, 31 (15.4%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751072" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="FTLD">frontotemporal lobar degeneration</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FTLD</z:e>), 17 (8.4%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0949664" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tauopathies</z:e>, 9 (4.4%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162534" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prion disease</z:e>, 6 (2.9%) vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), and 2 (0.9%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 43 cases with multiprotein deposits, we found 35 brains with deposits of 3 proteins (tau, β-amyloid, and α-synuclein) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In these two series of brains, the high incidence of deposition of multiple proteins in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> is shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results are in agreement with previous findings showing that tau, β-amyloid, and α-synuclein are the proteins most frequently deposited together </plain></SENT>
