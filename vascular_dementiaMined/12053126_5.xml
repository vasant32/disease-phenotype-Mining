<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Several studies have shown that plasma total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (tHcy) concentration is elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is not clear whether elevated plasma tHcy is a primary cause or a consequence of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: To elucidate this question, we have analysed plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> and its determinants in patients with early (EOAD)- and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> AD (LOAD) and compared the findings with those in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) and age- and sex-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One of the main findings in the present study is that in EOAD there is no change in the levels of either plasma tHcy or its determinants compared with an age- and sex-matched control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The fact that plasma tHcy concentration is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in EOAD thus indicates that elevated plasma tHcy is not the primary cause of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another main finding is that patients with mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD and VaD) and patients with VaD showed significantly increased plasma tHcy concentration compared with controls and that plasma tHCy concentration in patients with LOAD and a history of additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> was elevated compared both with AD patients without such a history and with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, there is an association between elevated plasma tHcy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A third main finding is that patients with AD who were followed up for several years showed a clinical deterioration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and an elevation of plasma tHcy concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding likewise supports the notion that elevated plasma tHcy is not the primary cause of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that elevated plasma tHcy is not the primary cause of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the findings indicate that elevated plasma tHcy might be a reflection of concomitant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> in AD patients </plain></SENT>
