<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Abstract Defining the vascular component(s) of the clinical diagnosis of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (VCI) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) continues to be problematic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to determine whether vascular stiffness, measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV), is altered in VaD, to study the utility of PWV in differentiating VaD from Alzheimer <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD) and the relationship between PWV and cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A qualitative and quantitative structured analysis of the literature was conducted until September 2010, using a search strategy based on the key words: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of vascular origin, cognitive function and arterial stiffness or pulse wave velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventeen studies assessed large vessel vascular stiff by PWV and related it to cognitive function or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six of these studies compared PWV in 154 persons with VaD, 207 with AD and 197 controls without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean PWV was significantly (p &lt; 0.0001) higher in VaD compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean PWV was significantly (p = 0.002) higher in VaD compared with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourteen studies examined the relationship between PWV and cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority of studies (nine of 14) reported a significant correlation between PWV and cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four of eight studies that evaluated the relation using univariate analysis reported a significant correlation of PWV with the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) or Hasegawa <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Scale, and the correlation with MMSE between studies showed a close agreement of correlation coefficients (0.206 to 0.27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, adjusted for a wide range of possible confounding factors, the majority or 80% (eight out of 10) studies comprising a population of 6,034 individuals found a significant inverse relationship between PWV and cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In summary, vascular stiffness is inversely related to cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Vascular stiffness is greater in VaD compared with AD, suggesting PWV may be useful in identifying VaD </plain></SENT>
