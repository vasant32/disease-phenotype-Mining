<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="34310">24S-hydroxycholesterol</z:chebi> (24S-OH-Chol) is an enzymatically oxidized product of cholesterol mainly synthesized in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that plasma levels of this <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53030">oxysterol</z:chebi> could be used as a putative biochemical marker for an altered cholesterol homeostasis in the brain of AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients with clinical criteria for AD, 30 healthy volunteers, 18 depressed patients, and 12 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (non-Alzheimer <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e>) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of 24S-OH-Chol were assayed by isotope dilution;-mass spectrometry, cholesterol was measured enzymatically, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (apoE) was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction and restricted fragment length polymorphism </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the concentrations of 24S-OH-Chol between depressed patients and healthy controls nor between AD and non-Alzheimer <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, this influence could be completely accounted for by the elevated plasma cholesterol in apoE4 hetero- or homozygotes </plain></SENT>
