<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A number of CT head scans, covering a 2-year period and showing a variety of distinct curvilinear subinsular lucent lesions, were collected and reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Variations in extent of involvement, tendency toward bilateral symmetry, and clinical background allowed the lesions to be grouped into four general patterns, most of which, to our knowledge, have not been specifically described in the radiologic literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This project was undertaken first to bring to the attention of those involved in interpretation of cranial CT images several patterns of injury they may not heretofore have been aware of and second to attempt to derive a specific etiology for each of the patterns described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pattern 1, which appears as a distinct curvilinear lesion (sometimes cystic) apparently limited to the lateral aspect of the putamen, is thought to represent the residua of previous lateral striatal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pattern 2, occurring in a markedly younger age group appears as relatively symmetrical bilateral subinsular lucencies, which in one case completely resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A specific etiology for this pattern remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo>, either secondary to a variant of anoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> or to a limited form of diffuse <z:mp ids='MP_0006082'>encephalomyelitis</z:mp>, is postulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A third pattern, which extends from generalized deep frontal white-matter lucency across the anterior limb of the internal capsule and tapering posteriorly in the subinsular area is thought to be on the basis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> similar to subcortical arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The fourth pattern, occurring as a broad band of lucency extending from the frontal horn of the lateral ventricle and also tapering posteriorly is due to relatively proximal occlusion of the lateral lenticulostriate arteries </plain></SENT>
