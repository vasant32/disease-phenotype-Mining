<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the differential diagnostic role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (apoE) genotype in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, we carried out a meta- analysis of 78 case-control series, including our own new data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subjects were grouped into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and non-AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AD patients were subgrouped according to their subtypes, and non-AD patients into vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MD), and non-AD non-VD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (NAVD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The apoE allele frequencies and apoE genotype-specific odds ratio (OR) of each group were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The (4 allele frequency was higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subgroups than in the elderly controls, and the associations with (4 allele were lower in the non-AD (OR 1.8) patients than in the AD (OR 4.2) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the apoE-related risk alsovaried as a function of the subgroup, in both the AD and non-AD groups; for AD, it was dependent on the subtype of AD (OR 2.3 - 11.3), and higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late- onset</z:hpo> and familial cases than in early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases, respectively; among non-AD patients, it was higher in MD (OR 2.6) than in VD (OR 1.3), and intermediate in NAVD (OR 1.9), in which a significant difference was also found between Lewy body <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBD</z:e>) type (OR 5.1) and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBD</z:e> type (OR 1.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, variability in the apoE-related risk was found in both the AD and non-AD cases, depending on the subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, precise subgrouping of both AD and non-AD patients should be performed, and this information should taken into consideration when interpreting the results of apoE genotyping </plain></SENT>
