<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Physicians from 88 Italian Alzheimer Evaluation Units were surveyed by means of a structured questionnaire assessing the proportion of patients with four different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> prescribed with drugs for cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms, and physicians' perceived efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37733">cholinesterase inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Units prescribed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37733">cholinesterase inhibitors</z:chebi> for 73 patients per year on average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37733">Cholinesterase inhibitors</z:chebi> are prescribed to 90% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), 80% with with Lewy body <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBD</z:e>), and 35-45% with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751072" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="FTLD">frontotemporal lobar degeneration</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FTLD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50949">serotonin uptake inhibitors</z:chebi> (SSRIs) are prescribed for 28-45% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> except <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBD</z:e> (16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Atypical <z:chebi fb="25" ids="35476">neuroleptics</z:chebi> were prescribed for 23-31% of patients, with no difference across types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other drugs, such as ginkgo and nootropics, were prescribed less frequently, except in VD (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The perceived efficacy on cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms, assessed on a 0-to-10 ordinal scale, was highest in AD (4.3-6.1), intermediate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBD</z:e> (3.5-5.3) and VD (3.3- 4.7), and lowest in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FTLD</z:e> (2.0-2.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that, in specialized Italian centers, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37733">cholinesterase inhibitors</z:chebi> and atypical <z:chebi fb="25" ids="35476">neuroleptics</z:chebi> are largely used in patients with AD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBD</z:e>, but the former are prescribed off-label to a remarkable proportion of patients with VD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FTLD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37733">cholinesterase inhibitors</z:chebi> is perceived to be highest in AD and poorest in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FTLD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Perceived efficacy is affected more by whom is treated than by what is used </plain></SENT>
