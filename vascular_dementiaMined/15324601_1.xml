<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although the introduction of modern neuroimaging techniques and standardized clinical evaluations has improved the identification of cerebrovascular disease, the clinical diagnosis of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) is still problematic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neuropathologic studies have found the current clinical criteria for VaD had low sensitivity with high specificity, suggesting that cerebrovascular disease of sufficient severity to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> is frequently associated with other disease processes (eg, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The critical factors about the diagnosis of VaD are centered on two issues: definition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and determination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The current clinical criteria for VaD have different definitions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, which are mainly based on an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>-like presentation, and severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> can present with or without history of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, there is a need for a better definition of VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is extremely important to better understand its risk factors, as well as to create homogenous cohorts suitable for drug trials </plain></SENT>
