<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To carry out a meta-analysis of the age-specific incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>, including AD and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several meta-analyses have been carried out on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> prevalence, but none on its incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used loess-curve fitting to analyze data from 23 published studies reporting age-specific incidence data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and AD rose exponentially up to the age of 90 years, with no sign of leveling off </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence rates for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> varied greatly from study to study, but the trend was also for an exponential rise with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no sex difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> incidence (p = 0.21), but women tended to have a higher incidence of AD in very old age, and men tended to have a higher incidence of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at younger ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>East Asian countries had a lower incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> than Europe (p = 0.0004), and also tended to have a lower incidence of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rises exponentially to the age of 90 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Any sex differences are small, and incidence is lower in East Asia than in Europe </plain></SENT>
