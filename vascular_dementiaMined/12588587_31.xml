<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between midlife risk factors and the development of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) 25 to 30 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A prevalence study within a longitudinal cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Subjects in the Adult Health Study (a prospective cohort study begun in 1958) have been followed through biennial medical examinations in Hiroshima, Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: One thousand seven hundred seventy-four subjects in Hiroshima, Japan born before September 1932 (1,660 with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 114 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (51 with AD, and 38 with VaD) diagnosed from 1992 to 1997 according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e>, Fourth Edition criteria) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: The subjects were examined for effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of sex, age, education, atomic bomb radiation dose, and midlife factors associated with risk (smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, dietary habits, systolic blood pressure (SBP), body mass index, and history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>) that had been evaluated in 1965-1970 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VaD prevalence increased significantly with age, higher SBP, and lower milk intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The odds ratios of VaD for age (in 5-year increments), SBP (10 mmHg increments), and milk intake (almost daily/less than four times a week) were 1.29, 1.33, and 0.35, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk factors for VaD were compatible with the risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in this study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AD prevalence increased significantly with age and lower education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other midlife factors and radiation dose did not show any significant association with VaD or AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Increased SBP and low milk intake in midlife were associated with VaD detected 25 to 30 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Early behavioral control of the risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> might reduce the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
