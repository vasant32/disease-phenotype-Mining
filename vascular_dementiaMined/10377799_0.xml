<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the type-specific prevalence, incidence, and risk factors of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in elderly persons from a Japanese community of Hisayama </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 1985, we performed a screening survey of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> among 887 Hisayama residents &gt; or = 65 years or older (screening rate, 95%), using clinical information and Hasegawa's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> scale, and consequently, determined 59 subjects as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, 58 cases underwent brain examinations at autopsy and/or computed tomography during the subsequent 12.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the 58 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, the frequency of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) was 43%: the rate was 2 times higher than that for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the subjects of VD, the most frequent type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was due to small-artery disease, which caused multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (40%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also followed the 826 nondemented subjects for 7 years starting in 1985 in order to determine the type-specific incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and its risk factors in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The age-adjusted total incidence (per 1,000 person-years) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 19.3 for men and 20.9 for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The corresponding rates of VD were 12.2 for men and 9.0 for women, and for AD 5.1 for men and 10.9 for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the VD subjects whose brain <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was examined, the most frequent type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was multiple lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (42%), but half these subjects lacked a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> episode in their histories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that age, prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> episodes, systolic blood pressure, and alcohol consumption were significant risk factors for the occurrence of VD </plain></SENT>
