<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Risk factors and conversion rates of MCI to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> have not been thoroughly investigated in developing countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chinese and English versions of Mini-Mental State Examination were administered serially among well-matched subjects from two clinics located in Xi'an, China and Houston, USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subtle <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> were weighed according to MCI criteria as defined previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects with MCI were followed for an additional 3 years after their identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses of VaD and DAT were made according to established criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During screening period, 73 American and 65 Chinese individuals were identified with MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 3 years of MCI follow-up, of the 73 American MCI subjects, 35 (47.9%) developed DAT and 15 (20.5%) developed VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 65 Chinese MCI subjects, 12 (18.5%) developed DAT and 19 (29.2%) developed VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, Chinese MCI subjects, despite their lower educational level, are 1.7 times less likely to progress to DAT and 2.3 times more likely to progress to VaD than American subjects within 3 years of MCI being identified (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Data suggest that progression rates of MCI vary considerably among subjects from two countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>American MCI subjects are more prone to DAT, while Chinese subjects are more prone to VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Differences in genetic factors, cultures, educational levels, and preventive treatments of vascular risk factors are proposed as responsible for this uneven geographic distribution for different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
