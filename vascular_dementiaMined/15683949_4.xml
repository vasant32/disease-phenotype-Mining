<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to find out if life events and personality are risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and varied according to the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>54 subjects meeting the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> IV criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were included and compared to 54 cognitively controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>25 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer type, 17 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> and 12 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data collection was performed using various questionnaires filled in by the patients and caregivers: questionnaire EVVIE for life events, the French version of the personality traits (VKP) for the assessment of personality, a questionnaire for diagnosing alexithymia (EFEA), the mini-geriatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scale for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004930" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">behavioural disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cognitive function was assessed by the Mini Mental State Examination, and the Global Deterioration Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were found between people suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and controls for the frequency and impact of several life events occurred during childhood, marital or professional life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some qualitative but no quantitative differences in life events experienced were found between patients with different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>People suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> had significant personality traits higher than controls such as passivity, avoidance, obsessive features and alexithymia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, no difference was found in personality traits between subjects with the different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that psychosocial cumulative stress and personality could constitute a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, which could be mediated by a dysregulation in the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi> axis </plain></SENT>
