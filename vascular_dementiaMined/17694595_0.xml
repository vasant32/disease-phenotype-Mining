<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Executive dysfunction is a hallmark of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer's Type (AD) and Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A complete neuropsychological battery contains measures of executive function, but the focus tends to be on cognitive processes with verbal or written output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Behavioral Dyscontrol Scale (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BDS</z:e>) is purported to be a measure of executive function that addresses control over voluntary motor behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previous factor analyses revealed three-factor solutions using a variety of patient populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our goals were to examine the factor structure in a sample of geriatric outpatients and to apply that factor structure to detect possible differences between AD, VaD, amnestic Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive Impairment</z:hpo> (MCI), non-amnestic MCI, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An exploratory factor analysis was performed on 260 outpatient evaluations from 2002-2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only the seven items requiring motor responses were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A two-factor solution emerged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We named the factors Motor Problem-Solving and Simple Motor Repetitive Behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For the first factor, the AD and VaD groups differed from the MCI groups and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, but did not differ from each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between the control, amnestic MCI, and non-amnestic MCI groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between the groups for the second factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It was concluded that voluntary control of behavior that requires problem-solving for complex tasks may help differentiate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> from mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aging </plain></SENT>
