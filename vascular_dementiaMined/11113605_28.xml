<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The simultaneous evaluation of the circadian rhythm of plasma <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> and ACTH and of serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> and DHEAS represents a clinically reliable tool to appreciate the neuroendocrine changes occurring in physiological and pathological brain aging.A selective impairment of the nocturnal <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> secretion has been observed in elderly subjects, being significantly related either to the age or to the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A significant increase of serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> levels during evening- and night-times was found in elderly subjects, particularly if <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e>, when compared to young controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Besides, both the circadian amplitude of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> rhythm and the nocturnal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> increase were significantly reduced in relation either to age or to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By comparison to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> exhibited the highest <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> concentrations throughout the 24h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to the steroid feedback was significantly impaired in old subjects and particularly in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The serum DHEAS levels were significantly lower in elderly subjects and even more in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients than in young controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consequently, a significant increase of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi>/DHEAS molar ratio was evident when going from young controls to healthy elderly subjects and to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the aging process affects many neuroendocrine functions resulting in subtle but clinically relevant consequences; the occurrence of senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> seems to play an additive role </plain></SENT>
