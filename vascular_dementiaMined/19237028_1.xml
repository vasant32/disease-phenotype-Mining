<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a multicenter, cross-sectional, observational study of 852 residents of public, private and state-assisted nursing homes throughout Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> was diagnosed according to the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV-TR clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Hughes Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating scale was used to measure global impairment or the global severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sociodemographic, clinical and neuropsychological variables, together with the pharmacological treatments prescribed to the participants, were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 61.7% (95% CI 58.4-65.1) and that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> was 16.9% (95% CI 14.3-19.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was found in 7.3% (95% CI 5.5-9.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Female sex was independently associated with a greater frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> increased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 18.8% (95% CI 15.4-22.3) of the patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> received specific treatment for the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Two-thirds of the elderly persons living in nursing homes in Spain have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Undertreatment of this disease is common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Increased awareness among health care professionals is important for the early diagnosis and appropriate management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, which would represent a radical change in the approach to this disease </plain></SENT>
