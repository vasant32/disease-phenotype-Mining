<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the ApoE epsilon 4 allele was significantly increased both in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> AD (0.35) and in VD (0.17); the frequency of ApoE epsilon 2 was significantly reduced in AD, but it was similar in VD and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of the allele 1 of PS-1 intronic polymorphism was not associated with AD or VD and was not influenced by the ApoE genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also, the frequency of allele A of the intronic polymorphism of ACT was similar in AD, VD and controls and it was not altered by ApoE or PS-1 genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results confirm the association between ApoE epsilon 4 and AD and indicate an increase in ApoE epsilon 4 in Vd, too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A potential protective role of ApoE epsilon 2 is also suggested for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> AD but not for VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No association was shown between ACT allele A and PS-1 allele 1 in AD or VD </plain></SENT>
