<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Patients were divided into 4 grades of increasing extent of vascular lesions on CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of VaD was compared between these grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A university department of neurology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Forty-two consecutive patients who underwent neuropsychological assessment for possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and who had a CT scan performed within 6 months following any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011206" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">delirium</z:e>, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, and motor and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748618" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory deficits</z:e> that impaired neuropsychological testing and patients with mass lesions or nonvascular white matter disease shown on CT were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The National Institute of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> and the Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences criteria for probable VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of VaD was greater in patients with grade 1 (7 [50%] of 14, P = .01), grade 2 (2[50%] of 4, P = .2), and grade 3(7[78%] of 9, P = .002) scans than the frequency of VaD with grade O scans (1[7%] of 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a linear association of the frequencies of VaD between imaging grades (P = .0008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a subgroup of patients with neuropsychological deficits caused by cerebrovascular disease, there was a linear association of the severity of the deficits between imaging grades (P = .007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that our criteria can separate CTs into increasing levels of support for a diagnosis of VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The extent of vascular lesions on CT reflects the severity of associated neuropsychological deficts </plain></SENT>
