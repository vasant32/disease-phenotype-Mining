<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical diagnosis of ATD (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer type) was made in 14 cases, of VD (vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) in 14 cases, of others in 5 cases and of undefined in 16 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At necropsy, 16 cases fulfilled the histological criteria for ATD, while 15 cases were VD, 3 cases were mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 14 cases were other <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 2 other cases, the neuropathological picture was considered to be nondiagnostic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of clinical diagnosis of VD was higher than that of ATD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical diagnostic sensitivity was 81.8% for ATD and 91.7% for VD; corresponding specificity was 78.3% and 86.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With our clinical criteria, slowly evolving VD with no clinical evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> would not be identified as VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, AD patients who happened to have a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> would be diagnosed as VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that further investigations as to VD (its clinical course, findings of computed tomographic scan and magnetic resonance imaging) are needed for more appropriate clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
