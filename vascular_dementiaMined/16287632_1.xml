<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological performances of VaD patients were compared with a group of patients affected by probable AD, matched for age, education, and severity of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The comparison of performances did not reach statistical significance in single neuropsychological tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that neuropsychological examination might not clearly differentiate between VaD and AD patients; the similar pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> is probably indicative of several common pathogenetic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
