<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that hemodynamic and metabolic changes in the cortex during a simple motor task may reflect the impaired neurovascular coupling in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used fMRI and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) simultaneously, which together provided multiple hemodynamic responses as well as a robust estimation of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the task periods, the oxy-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, total-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and CMRO(2) decreased statistically significantly in the primary motor and somatosensory cortices of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> patients, whereas the oxygen extraction fraction increased when compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Notably, the flow-metabolism coupling ratio, n representing the ratio of oxygen supply to its utilization, showed a robust reduction in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> patient group (n(Control)=1.99 ± 0.23; n(<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>)=1.08 ± 0.24), which implies a loss of metabolic reserve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results support the pathological small vessel compromise, including an increased vessel stiffness, impaired vascular reactivity, and impaired neurovascular coupling in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, simultaneous measurement by NIRS and fMRI can reveal various hemodynamic and metabolic changes and may be used for as an early detection or monitoring of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
