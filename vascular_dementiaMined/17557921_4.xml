<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statins</z:chebi> are reported to be beneficial in treating a multitude of disorders including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) with varying, yet-to-be determined mechanisms of actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37733">cholinesterase inhibitors</z:chebi> (ChEIs) are still recommended as the primary drug of choice for AD and related diseases, their efficacy is frequently questioned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recently reported that alpha7-neuronal <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> nicotinic receptor (alpha7-nAChR)-mediated neurogenic vasodilation of porcine cerebral arteries was blocked by ChEIs, and this blockade was prevented by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> pretreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The exact mechanism of interaction between ChEIs and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Activation of alpha7-nAChRs located on perivascular postganglionic sympathetic nerve terminals releases <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>, which then acts on presynaptic beta(2)-adrenoceptors located on neighboring nitrergic nerve terminals, resulting in nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> release and vasodilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present study, therefore, was designed to determine whether interaction of ChEIs and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> occurs at the alpha7-nAChR level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We examined effects of concurrent application of ChEIs and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> on alpha7-nAChR-mediated inward currents in primary neuronal cultures of rat superior cervical ganglion cells, the origin of the perivascular sympathetic innervation to the cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27953">physostigmine</z:chebi>, neostigmine, and galantamine inhibited <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi>-induced whole cell currents in a concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This inhibition, which was noncompetitive in nature, was prevented by concurrent application of mevastatin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40303">lovastatin</z:chebi> in a concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> protect alpha7-nAChR function directly at the receptor level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since alpha7-nAChR is neuroprotective, having beneficial effects on memory and cerebral vascular function, its functional inhibition by ChEIs may explain in part the limitation of its effectiveness in AD and VaD therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Protection of alpha7-nAChR function from ChEI inhibition by concurrent administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> may provide an alternative strategy in improving the efficacy of AD and VaD therapy </plain></SENT>
