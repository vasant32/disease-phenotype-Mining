<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Kangxin Capsule (KXC) on the expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) as well as the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and amount of nerve synapse in the cortical parietal lobe and hippocampus CA, area of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> ( VD) model rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The model rats of VD made by photochemical reaction technique were randomly divided into five groups: the model group (MG), the high-dose, middle-dose and low-dose KXC groups (HDG, MDG and LDG), and the Western medicine hydergin control group (WMG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were treated respectively with distilled water, high, middle and low dosage of KXC suspended liquid, and hydergin for a month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Besides, a blank group consisting of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (non-model) rats was set up for control (CG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ultrastructure of nerve synapse in the cortical parietal lobe and hippocampus CA1 area of the rats were observed and its density estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The condition of NGF positive neurons in the above-mentioned two regions were also observed by immunohistochemical stain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the KXC or hydergin treated groups demonstrated a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> amount of nerve synapse with integral structure in the cortical parietal lobe and hippocampus CA, area, which approached that in the CG and was superior to that in the MG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, the NGF positive neuron in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the treated groups was much more than that in MG with significant difference ( P&lt;0.01), approaching to that in the CG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: KXC could elevate the expression of NGF in the cortical parietal lobe and hippocampus CA, area, preserve the number and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of synapse, thus to protect the function of nerve system from ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
