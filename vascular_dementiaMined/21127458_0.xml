<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Understanding genetic dissection of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) has been quite limited by single gene analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We simultaneously analyzed multiple genes in their association with the susceptibility to VD to examine the genetic susceptibility controlled by their additive and epistatic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred and seven VD patients and age/sex matched 207 controls were genotyped for 71 candidate genes that were expressed in the human brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multifactor dimensionality reduction was used to select the best genetic variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then, entropy decomposition was applied to assess the selected variants' individual and interactive genetic contributions to the susceptibility to VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The best two-locus, three-locus, four-locus candidate models resulted by the multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis showed the significance in both training and testing accuracy estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The largest estimate (10 out of 10) of cross-validation consistency was obtained for the two-locus model that included family with sequence similarity 134 member B (FAM134B, rs10041159) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor receptor superfamily, member 19 (TNFRSF19, rs9317882) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The subsequent entropy decomposition analysis showed that individual genetic variants eliminated the uncertainty of 3.02 and 6.25% in case-control status, and the entropy largely decreased with the presence of their interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Especially, the interaction among genetic variants included in the final model rendered the additional decrease (32.95%) of entropy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The FAM134B and TNFRSF19 showed a dramatically strong synergistic epistasis in explaining the genetic dissection of the susceptibility to complex VD </plain></SENT>
