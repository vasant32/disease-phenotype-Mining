<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 33 of 60 AD cases, a white matter disease (WMD) characterized by tissue rarefaction, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> and a non-amyloid small-vessel <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> occurred in the central, preferentially frontal deep white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean vessel density was significantly lower than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control case frontal white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of WMD did not parallel the severity of grey matter Alzheimer <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 25 of 60 AD cases, white matter degeneration with signs of both condensation and rarefaction of tissue elements was seen subjacent to advanced cortical degeneration in the temporal lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It concurred with WMD in only 13 cases and was judged to be of anterograde, Wallerian type and not related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In VaD, similar changes occurred, accompanied by several types of focal and topographically related lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For diffuse white matter pathology of similar appearance in vascular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative disease</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, there may be various at least partly contrasting aetiologies, which can be differentiated by the presence of even minor focal lesions in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the recognition of such subtle variations in the spectrum of WMD, modern imaging techniques are crucial for detailed clinical diagnosis and attempts at therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
