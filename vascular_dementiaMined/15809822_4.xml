<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These behavioral symptoms can be a major cause of stress, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and concern for caregivers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35471">psychotropic drugs</z:chebi> are frequently used to control these symptoms, they have the potential for significant side effects, which include sedation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000734'>disinhibition</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">incontinence</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0392156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">akathisia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We followed up (for 12 months) a group of 346 consecutive outpatients, with a diagnosis of subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or multi-infarctual <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients eligible for this open-label study were required to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral problems</z:hpo> (BPSD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups, Group A received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7735">olanzapine</z:chebi> 2.5-7.5 mg/day while Group B received typical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients in both groups were allowed to continue any previous therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients in both groups were significantly improved in their BPSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our patients had a host of medical conditions and received numerous concomitant medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Given the potential complications associated with these therapeutic agents, these patients tolerated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7735">olanzapine</z:chebi> quite well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On examination of consequences of adverse events, particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001262'>somnolence</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002172'>postural instability</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>postural hypotension</z:hpo>, it appeared that cerebrovascular events were not present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, no anticholinergic effect was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7735">olanzapine</z:chebi> could be a safe and effective treatment even for elderly population in suitable doses and receiving the adequate follow-up </plain></SENT>
