<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: WE INVESTIGATED THE INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF HTS WHILE ADMINISTERING A SHORT COGNITIVE TEST (THE REVISED HASEGAWA <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0497327" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">DEMENTIA</z:e> RATING SCALE: HDSR) in outpatients with AD [125 patients, including 4 with AD + vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD)], 8 with amnestic mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (aMCI), 34 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>), 8 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSNP1">progressive supranuclear palsy</z:e> (PSP) and 6 with VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant differences were found among the 5 disease groups in the incidence and severity of HTS, and HDSR scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Given the significant differences between AD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> in post hoc analyses, patients were dichotomized into AD-related (AD and aMCI) and AD-nonrelated (PSP, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> and VaD) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both incidence (41 vs. 17%, p = 0.002) and severity of HTS (0.80 ± 1.13 vs. 0.21 ± 0.60, p = 0.001) were significantly higher in the AD-related group, while average age and HDSR scores were comparable between both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AD-related disease, female gender and low HDSR score contributed significantly to the occurrence and severity of HTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HTS can be a clinical marker of AD and aMCI, and may represent a type of excuse behavior as well as a sign of dependency on and trust in the caregivers </plain></SENT>
