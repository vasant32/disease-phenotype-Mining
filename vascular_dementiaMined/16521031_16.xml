<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE: Nighttime <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> occurs frequently in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and represents the number one burden on caregivers today </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current treatment options are few and limited due to substantial side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to measure the effect of the cannabinoid dronabinol on nocturnal motor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In an open-label pilot study, six consecutive patients in the late stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and suffering from circadian and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral disturbances</z:hpo>-five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and one patient with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-were treated with 2.5 mg dronabinol daily for 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Motor activity was measured objectively using actigraphy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to baseline, dronabinol led to a reduction in nocturnal motor activity (P=0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings were corroborated by improvements in Neuropsychiatric Inventory total score (P=0.027) as well as in subscores for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo>, aberrant motor, and nighttime behaviors (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No side effects were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that dronabinol was able to reduce nocturnal motor activity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> in severely <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, it appears that dronabinol may be a safe new treatment option for behavioral and circadian disturbances in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
