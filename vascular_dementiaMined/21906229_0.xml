<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such is the dialogical structure of evil and it seems to be the dialogical structure of elder abuse as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is a perturbing sameness between definitions of evil and definitions of elder abuse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is hard at times to see how or if there is any line of demarcation between the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two modern-day philosophers, Paul Ricoeur and Simone <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043102" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Weil</z:e> have delved particularly into the concept of evil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The symbolism Ricoeur analyses in depth is that of defilement, sin, and guilt and the concept of the servile will </plain></SENT>
