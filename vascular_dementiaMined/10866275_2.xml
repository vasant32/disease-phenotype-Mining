<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A graph method was employed to analyse spatial neuronal patterns of pontine nuclei with ascending aminergic projections to the forebrain (nucleus centralis superior (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>), raphes dorsalis (NRD) and locus coeruleus (LC)), in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>), and vascular (VD) as well as "mixed-type" (VA) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, compared with non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> controls (CO) and a small sample of brains from schizophrenics ("<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> praecox" (DP)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The quantitative evaluations by the "minimal spanning tree (MST)" were complemented by rough neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) counts and by semiquantitative immunohistochemical assessment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath>, neuritic plaque formation, and cellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The AD cases showed a significant decline of neuronal density in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nuclei examined, as compared with controls and DP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>Neuronal loss</z:hpo> was not significant in VD, while the mixed cases with both vascular and Alzheimer-type pathology exhibited pronounced changes of neuronal density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>Amyloid deposition</z:mpath> occurred almost exclusively in AD and VA, as a rule, being of moderate degree, except for two presenile AD cases where it was marked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NFT were significantly increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nuclei in AD and in the VA cases, while they only occasionally appeared beyond age 55 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>, DP and CO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> cases showed in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> and NRD <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> as severe as in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> implicates impairment of serotoninergic and noradrenergic neuromodulation as one basic mechanism promoting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in AD, VA and perhaps in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
