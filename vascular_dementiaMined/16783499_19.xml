<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have revealed an alteration in BDNF expression in the postmortem brains of AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BDNF has great potential as a therapeutic agent because of its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and due to its wide in vivo distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about in vivo BDNF in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the immunological function of neurotrophins such as BDNF has received great interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the serum levels of BDNF and cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The following subjects were included in this study: 60 AD patients, 60 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) patients and 33 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AD and VaD patients were matched for age, gender and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum BDNF levels in AD patients were significantly lower than those in VaD patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels showed no significant difference among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups, neither the TNF-alpha nor the IL-1beta levels correlated with the BDNF levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that BDNF may play a pathological role in some cases of AD </plain></SENT>
