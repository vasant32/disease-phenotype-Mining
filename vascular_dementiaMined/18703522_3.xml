<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: to determine whether functional changes in the vasculature differ between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: we determined vascular stiffness in patients with a clinical and radiological diagnosis of either AD or VAD and compared them to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> age- and sex-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 16 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> AD, 13 subjects with VAD and 16 age- and sex-matched controls were recruited to this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Central arterial compliance (CAC), augmentation index (AI) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) (measures of arterial stiffness) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: the mean age was 77.7 +/- 8.3 years (mean +/- SD) in the AD group, 79.7 +/- 8.9 years in the VAD group and 76.4 +/- 6.9 in the controls (P = 0.44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CAC was significantly lower in subjects with VAD compared to both the AD and the control groups (0.57 +/- 0.46 ml/mm Hg versus 1.12 +/- 0.57 and 1.1 +/- 0.47 ml/mm Hg respectively, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AI was significantly higher in the subjects with VAD compared to both the AD and the control groups (13.3 +/- 9.0 versus 3.5 +/- 11.4 and 4.2 +/- 9.7% respectively, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PWV in the muscular and elastic arteries were not statistically different between the three groups but tended to be highest in the VAD group for carotid-radial measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: the reduced CAC and increased AI in VAD subjects indicate that the disease process is associated with less vascular compliance of the large elastic arteries in these patients, but not in patients with AD </plain></SENT>
