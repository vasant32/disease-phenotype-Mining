<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Quantitative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging differences in an elderly population of subjects with various clinical disorders (including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, particularly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) and disorders of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Potential quantitative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> differences were assessed by presence or absence of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (APOE) epsilon4 allele and by level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679466" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deficit</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred eighty subjects with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or other clinical disorders were identified from an eligible population of 5,677 elderly individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age, duration of disease, and head size (where appropriate) were considered as covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>APOE genotype was determined by polymerase chain reaction using buccal material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Axial and coronal intermediate- and T2-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were quantified using a multispectral segmentation algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cognitive status was assessed by means of a modified Mini-Mental Status Examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> types of dementing illness showed significant volume reductions in the majority of structures examined, particularly in the total brain, hippocampus, and white and gray matter, and increased CSF and ventricular volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subjects with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> showed fewer atrophic changes but were still distinguishable from the 24 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Presence of an epsilon4 allele was associated with smaller hippocampal volume in subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> within just 1 year of disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For other analyses, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> related to the presence of the epsilon4 allele disappeared after controlling for age and length of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The effects of the epsilon4 allele on brain <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> may be subtly expressed early in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, but do not specifically affect <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive impairment</z:hpo> is associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> irrespective of diagnosis and presence of epsilon4 </plain></SENT>
