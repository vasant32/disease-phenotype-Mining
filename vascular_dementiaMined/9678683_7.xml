<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subjects with Alzheimer type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), and controls without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (C) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with AD were divided into mild AD (mAD) and severe AD (sAD) by the use of Hasegawa's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Q-Alb and the ratio of CSF alpha1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) to serum ACT (Q-ACT) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correlations between Q-Alb and Q-ACT were compared among the groups (mAD, sAD, VD, C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlations between Q-Alb and major monoaminergic neurochemicals were also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was suggested that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability was preserved in C group, while it was impaired in the patients with VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In AD group it appeared to be rather well preserved in mAD, while it seemed to be disturbed in a graded manner according to the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
