<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a previous study provided evidence that the relation between a high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> level and low <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> levels in AD patients is due to biochemical damage, rather than a nutritional deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> levels and vitamins involved in its metabolism in AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two VaD patients, 22 AD patients and 24 healthy subjects were studied for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="14" ids="27306">vitamin B6</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients and control subjects were comparable for age, educational level, nutritional and socioeconomic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of them showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001972'>macrocytic anemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>impaired renal function</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> was significantly increased in VaD patients (26.0 +/- 6.58 micromol/l) as compared to controls (10.7 +/- 3.0 micromol/l) and AD patients (22.3 +/- 4.51 micromol/l; p&lt;0.001); however, AD patients also showed increased levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">Folates</z:chebi> were significantly reduced in both VaD (10.8 +/- 2.81 nmol/l) and AD (10.0 +/- 2.72 nmol/l; p&lt;0.001) patients, while <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> showed significantly reduced levels only in AD patients (392.1 +/- 65.32 pmol/l; p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="14" ids="27306">Vitamin B6</z:chebi> was not significantly different in the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> associated with low <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> plasma levels were found only in AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This observation led us to consider that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> metabolism does not represent the direct consequence of the nutritional status and suggests that neuronal damage results in a functional <z:hpo ids='HP_0100502'>vitamin B12 deficiency</z:hpo>, as emphasized by recent reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>New therapeutic strategies are necessary, considering that available pharmaceutical forms of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> are not utilized by neurons in <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> conditions </plain></SENT>
