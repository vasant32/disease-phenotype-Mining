<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to validate a new Motoric Cognitive Risk (MCR) syndrome to identify individuals at high risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated 997 community residing individuals aged 70 and older participating in the Einstein Aging Study over a median follow-up time of 36.9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MCR syndrome was defined as presence of cognitive complaints and slow gait (one standard deviation below age- and sex-specific gait speed means) in nondemented individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox models were used to evaluate the effect of MCR syndrome on the risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-two participants met criteria for MCR syndrome at baseline with a prevalence of 7% (95% CI: 5-9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of MCR increased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Participants with MCR were at higher risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (hazard ratio [HR] adjusted for age, sex, and education: 3.27, 95% CI: 1.55-6.90) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (adjusted HR: 12.81, 95% CI: 4.98-32.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association of MCR with risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> remained significant even after accounting for other confounders and diagnostic overlap with "cognitive" mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> syndrome subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A motor-based MCR syndrome provides a clinical approach to identify individuals at high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, especially vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, to target for further investigations and who may benefit from preventive interventions </plain></SENT>
