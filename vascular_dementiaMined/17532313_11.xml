<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> and serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> levels were studied 67 VaD, 51 AD and 40 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vascular risk factors in these groups were also considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The changes in the levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> were found to be not related with vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In VaD, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> level was higher (p&lt;0.001), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> levels were lower (p&lt;0.05 for <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, p&lt;0.001 for <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi>) than those in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> level was negatively correlated with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> (p&lt;0.05) in VaD but in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> ratios were the highest in VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The increase of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> in AD were seemed to be not related to cerebrovascular injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is possibly related to biochemical damages as result of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
