<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Demented</z:e> patients with AD and VaD and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> old adults were assessed on episodic memory tasks, including free recall and recognition of slowly and rapidly presented unrelated words and free and cued recall of organizable words </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results showed a general deficit in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> groups across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> memory variables, although the AD and VaD patients were indistinguishable across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> old showed proficient utilization of more study time, organizability, and category cues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the AD and VaD patients were able to benefit from cognitive support only when guidance was provided at both encoding and retrieval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> old, recall of unrelated words was characterized by a relatively equal contribution from primary and secondary memory, whereas the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients relied predominantly on primary memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggests a similarity between AD and VaD patients with regard to the nature of the episodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo>, despite etiologic differences between the diseases </plain></SENT>
