<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Randomized, controlled, double-blind, multicenter clinical trial involving 410 outpatients with mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> with or without cerebrovascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disease, vascular</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>), scoring at least 5 on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), with at least one item score of 3 or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total scores on the SKT cognitive test battery (Erzigkeit's short syndrome test) were between 9 and 23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After random allocation, the patients took 240 mg of EGb 761(®) or placebo once daily for a period of 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes from baseline to week 24 in the NPI composite and in the SKT total score were the primary outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The NPI distress score was chosen as a secondary outcome measure to evaluate caregivers' distress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The NPI composite score improved by -3.2 (95% confidence interval -4.0 to -2.3) in patients taking EGb 761(®) (n = 202), but did not change (-0.9; 0.9) in those receiving placebo (n = 202), which resulted in a statistically significant difference in favor of EGb 761(®) (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with EGb 761(®) was significantly superior to placebo for the symptoms <z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo>/indifference, sleep/night-time behavior, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo>/lability, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233477" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">dysphoria</z:e>, and aberrant motor behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Caregivers' distress evaluation revealed similar baseline pattern and improvements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Treatment with EGb 761(®), at a once-daily dose of 240 mg, was safe, effectively alleviated behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and improved the wellbeing of their caregivers </plain></SENT>
