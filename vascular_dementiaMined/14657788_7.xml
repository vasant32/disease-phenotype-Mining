<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We applied magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) criteria based on research criteria for SIVD in a large cohort of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared clinical features of patients with SIVD and patients with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECT AND METHODS: The study group comprised 337 of 486 consecutive patients aged 55 to 85 years who 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> completed a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery and MRI, including structured medical, neurologic, and laboratory evaluations; clinical mental status examination; interview of a knowledgeable informant; detailed history of risk factors; and evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> type, localization, and syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with SIVD (n = 86) more often had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>progressive cognitive decline</z:hpo> (22.8% vs. 6.9%, P = 0.0002), walking disorder before <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (27.9% vs. 2.0%, P = 0.02), and urinary difficulties (12.8% vs. 5.6%, P = 0.028) in comparison with patients with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> type (n = 251) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the study population, 107 (31.8%) had <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients with SIVD more often had <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (40.7% vs. 28.7%, P = 0.04), had less severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as measured by Scandinavian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (56.6 vs. 55.1, P = 0.03), were more dependent in activities of daily living (ADL) functions as measured by FAQ scale (8.9 vs. 5.4, P = 0.001), were more dependent in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) functions as measured by the Lawton scale (5.5 vs. 6.3, P = 0.01), and were more depressed as measured by the Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory (11.8 vs. 8.4, P = 0.0003) poststroke than the patients without SIVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main cognitive domain that differentiated the patients with SIVD from those without was executive dysfunction (51.2% vs. 38.7%, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>According to multiple regression model, apractic-atactic gait disorder (odds ratio 2.82, 95% confidence interval 1.21-6.53), ADL functions (odds ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.08), and the Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory (odds ratio 1.05, 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.09) related to SIVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The most significant clinical features of MRI-defined SIVD were found to be apractic-atactic gait, impaired ADL functions, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
