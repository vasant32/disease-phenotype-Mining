<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cholinergic transporters control cellular mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>) synthesis and release at presynaptic terminals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study has assessed the influence of 4 week treatment with two different cholinergic enhancing drugs, the cholinergic precursor <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> alphoscerate (alpha-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="24364">glyceryl</z:chebi>-phosphorylcholine) or the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor galantamine on high affinity <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> uptake transporter (CHT) and vesicular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> transporter (VAChT) expression in the brain of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SHR represent an animal model of cerebrovascular injury characterized by cholinergic hypofunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis was performed by immunochemistry, ELISA and immunohistochemistry on frontal cortex, striatum and hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunochemical and ELISA analysis was extended to peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), used as a peripheral reference of changes of brain cholinergic markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An increased expression of VAChT and CHT was observed in brain areas investigated and in PBL of SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The similar trend for cholinergic transporters observed in brain and PBL suggests these cells may represent a marker of brain cholinergic transporters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> alphoscerate increased CHT and to a greater extent VAChT expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment with galantamine countered the increase of CHT and VAChT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The different activity of the cholinergic precursor and of the AChE inhibitor on parameters investigated is likely related to their mechanism of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">Choline</z:chebi> alphoscerate increases <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> synthesis and release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This requires an augmentation of systems regulating neurotransmitter uptake and storage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> alphoscerate on CHT and VAChT observed in this study suggests an improved synaptic efficiency elicited by the compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The AChE inhibitor slows-down <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> degradation in the synaptic cleft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A greater availability of neurotransmitter elicited by galantamine counters the enhanced activity of cholinergic transporters compensating cholinergic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Differences in the activity of the cholinergic precursor and AChE inhibitor investigated on CHT and VAChT suggests that association between <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> alphoscerate and AChE/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37733">cholinesterase inhibitors</z:chebi> may represent a strategy for potentiating deficient cholinergic neurotransmission worthwhile of being investigated in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
