<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mean flow velocity (MFV) of middle cerebral artery and rCBF were measured by Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) and arterial spin-labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance, separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CVR was evaluated by MFV or rCBF change in response to 5% <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> inhalation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ASL results showed that, rCBF was significantly lower in both the bilateral frontal and temporal lobes in AD group and lower in left frontal and temporal white matter in patients with VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CVR calculated by rCBF was impaired more severely in bilateral frontal cortices in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, TCD tests failed to demonstrate significant difference in MFV and CVR between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the different patterns detected by ASL in resting rCBF change and cerebrovascular reactivity in response to carbogen inhalation may be a potential marker to distinguish AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
