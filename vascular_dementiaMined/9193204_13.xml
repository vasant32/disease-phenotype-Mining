<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the evolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), and mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> by cognitive domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SETTING: The University of Western Ontario <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Study, which is a registry of cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> seen for secondary and tertiary assessment in a university <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025261" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory disorders</z:e> clinica with extensive follow-up data and histopathological confirmation of clinical diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: One hundred twenty-nine patients with definite or probable AD, 12 patients with definite or probable VaD, and 36 patients with definite or probable mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were grouped as having an early, moderate, or advanced stage of disease according to the extended scale for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (ESD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ESD was subdivided into cognitive domains, and the domain scores were compared for each stage of disease by diagnostic category with the use of a 2-way analysis of variance with repeated measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As expected, the scores in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> domains decreased significantly with increasing severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in the decline in memory among the diagnostic groups (P = .02) that was mostly attributable to the difference between AD and mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (P = .03), with the difference between AD and VaD only approaching significance (P = .06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a similar finding for praxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The interaction between diagnosis (AD and VaD) and severity was significant only for memory (P = .02), showing a less severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficit</z:e> at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> but a proportionately more <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> in VaD and arithmetic ability (AD and mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> [P = .03]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, VaD, and mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> evolve similarly as assessed using cognitive domains obtained by subdivision of the ESD in a patient population derived from a memory clinic and by analyzing VaD as a single entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> evolves differently between AD and VaD, with this depending on the severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Memory is more severely impaired in the early stage of AD; however, with increasing severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> in VaD accelerates and catches up with AD at the level of moderate impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The differences between AD and mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are greater than those between mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and VaD, suggesting an important role for the ischemic component of mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Simple neuropsychological tools (eg, the ESD) may be incapable of distinguishing between AD and VaD, and more focused instruments may be required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Inherent bias in case selection may prevent extrapolation of these results to VaD in general, but the neuropsychological criteria for VaD may need to vary, depending on the severity </plain></SENT>
