<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 202 consecutive consenting eligible <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> survivors and a matched sample of 97 community controls were followed for up to 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data for 167 patients who underwent detailed assessment 3-6 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were analyzed to determine predictors of outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cumulative mortality rates for patients (and controls) were 27% (4%) for the first 5 years and rose to 83% (10%) by 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Predictors of mortality were older age, any <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, less independent function, and less education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nursing home admission rates were 24% at 5 years and 32% at 10 years for patients and 0 for controls over 8.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Predictors of institutionalization were less independent function and older age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> who survive the first week have moderate, lower-than-expected mortality rates in the first 5 years that increase thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>VaMCI, VaD, and functional decline are predictors of mortality, while functional decline and older age predict institutionalization </plain></SENT>
