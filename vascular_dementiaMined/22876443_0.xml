<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test the influence of acupuncture on cognitive function and a marker of oxidative DNA damage in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixteen VD patients were evaluated before and after acupuncture, using the Folstein mini-mental state examination-revised (MMSE-R) to assess cognitive function, and the ADL-R scale to assess independence in activities of daily living (ADL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Life quality was evaluated using the DEMQOL (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> quality of life questionnaire) questionnaire, and syndromes and expression of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were evaluated with the Scale for the differentiation of syndromes of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (SDSVD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the urine concentration of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG)--a marker of oxidative damage--was quantified with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The MMSE-R and DEMQOL scores were higher after acupuncture than before (P &lt; 0.05), while there were no obvious differences in the ADL-R or SDSVD scores (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 8-OHdG content in urine significantly decreased after acupuncture (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Acupuncture reduces the levels of 8-OHdG and improves cognitive function and quality of life in VD patients, suggesting that acupuncture is beneficial at least in part by preventing oxidative damage </plain></SENT>
