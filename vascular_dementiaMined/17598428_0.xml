<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A total of 1000 subjects were selected randomly from the total population (n=2527) of over 60 years of age from the dwelling communes of Pruszcz Gdański, Trabki Wielkie and Pszczółki </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A two-phase study consisting of a phase I screening survey using the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and a phase II diagnostic examination using the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10 criteria was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Next, 100 subjects were randomized from subjects with an MMSE score less than 25 (total number of 283) and included to the second phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was estimated at 6.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of total <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 3.0% for men and 8.8% for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> was 1.1% for men and 4.0% for women and that of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> 1.9% and 3.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results showed that the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in a rural population was different from that previously reported in other Polish regions, but was similar to its presence in some other countries, especially in the rural regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study confirms that female sex has a higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> risk factor </plain></SENT>
