<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Investigate the impact of the changes in eligibility within England and Wales (E&amp;W) for prescription within the UK National Health Service for treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A population-based study in England and Wales with 13,004 individuals measured with MMSE at baseline was used to examine the distributions of individuals within eligibility criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Information obtained from informants enabled classification of the study defined <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases to ICD10 diagnosis of subtype (AD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with vascular risk, both or other) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty six per cent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients (representing 323,000 individuals in E&amp;W) fall into the new MMSE criteria band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A further 120,000, 20% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients, are estimated to have disease that is considered too mild for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further examination of type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> showed that those with mixed AD and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> had similar proportions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases within the treatable MMSE group as the subgroup with AD alone, though with mixed disease individuals more often score below the lower threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There is substantial instability in the eligibility groupings over a short time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The population impact of new NICE criteria of excluding high MMSE scores is to exclude one in five individuals with AD and a further one in ten of those with a mixed disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Changing the guidance has almost balanced the loss of treatment for the high MMSE group (13%) with the introduction of treatment for those scoring 10/11 (11%) </plain></SENT>
