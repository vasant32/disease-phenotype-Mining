<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> is increased in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> but is also increased in clinically diagnosed and histologically confirmed AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is generally considered that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> potentiates endothelial and neuronal oxidative injury in these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A complementary model of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002160'>hyperhomocystinemia</z:hpo> is proposed by the authors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis accounts for several unusual features relating to single-carbon metabolism and AD, including the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001972'>macrocytic anemia</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> augments the oxidation of an intermediate form of vitamin B(12) (cob[I]alamin) generated in the methionine synthase reaction, thereby impairing the metabolism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> also compromises the intraneuronal reduction of the vitamin to its metabolically active state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Currently available pharmaceutic forms of vitamin B(12) are unlikely to be utilized by neurons under these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Glutathionylcobalamin might be preferential for the treatment of such patients </plain></SENT>
