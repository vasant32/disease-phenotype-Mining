<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In 31 patients with probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), 19 with probable vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) and 20 with Possible AD and Possible VaD, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau levels hyperphosphorylated at threonine 181 (Ptau) were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six age-matched subjects were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The severity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> was assessed at the time of CSF analysis and after a 12-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The groups had comparable age, degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and disease duration; these parameters were not related to P-tau levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>P-tau discriminated between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients and controls, but no significant difference emerged between AD and the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, higher P-tau values were found to predict, independently of the clinical diagnosis, a more rapid evolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whether these findings are due to a lack of CSF P-tau specificity or to the low reliability of clinical and radiological criteria remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>P-tau may be useful in the evaluation of disease evolution, by predicting the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
