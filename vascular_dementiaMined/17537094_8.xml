<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Multidisciplinary memory clinic in a tertiary hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: One hundred thirty consecutive patients with AD, with or without CI, followed up regularly for more than 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: The patients were classified according to the distribution and severity of CI as defined according to the NINDS-AIREN neuroimaging criteria into those with AD and no CI (AD-N), those with AD and CI not fulfilling neuroimaging criteria (AD-I), and those with AD and CI fulfilling neuroimaging criteria (AD-V), and their differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> progression were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The loss of independence, indicated by institution admission or a clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rating (CDR) score of 3, was defined as the endpoint for a poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age was 75.8, and 68.5% were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The initial Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was 15.3+/-0.4, and the average duration of follow up was 30.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four patients had reached study endpoint at the time of analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AD-V (hazard ratio (HR)=3.1, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.2-8.2), use of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35471">psychotropic drugs</z:chebi> (HR=2.7, 95% CI=1.1-6.4), and initial MMSE score (HR=0.9, 95% CI=0.8-1.0) were independent predictors of poor outcome in the Cox regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In AD, co-occurrence of CI with distribution and severity as defined in the NINDS-AIREN neuroimaging criteria for VaD is associated with faster <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> progression </plain></SENT>
