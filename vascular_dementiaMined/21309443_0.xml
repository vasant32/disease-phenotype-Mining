<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The data were analyzed using the event-related synchronization/desynchronization (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ERS</z:e>/ERD) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>VD patients, compared with controls, showed decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ERS</z:e> effects in the delta frequency band (0.5-3.5Hz) of EEG after the target stimulus appeared in frontal, central and parietal regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similarly, elderly controls also showed a decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ERS</z:e> compared with young controls only in central and parietal regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As part of this analysis, we introduce a novel quantitative index, the Event-related Energy Change Progression (EECP), which provides a reliable measure that distinguishes these groups and thereby provides a promising marker for early diagnosis of VD </plain></SENT>
