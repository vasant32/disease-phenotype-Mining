<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in a very large majority of cases, these alterations occur in an already aged brain, characterized by a milieu of cellular and molecular events common for different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cell signaling defects and molecular dyshomeostasis might lead to neuronal malfunction prior to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of neurons and the alteration of neuronal networks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present paper, we explore some of the molecular mechanisms underlying brain malfunction triggered by cerebrovascular disease and risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We suggest that, in the age of genetic investigation and molecular diagnosis, the concept of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> needs a new approach </plain></SENT>
