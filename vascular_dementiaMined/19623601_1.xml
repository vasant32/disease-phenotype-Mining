<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the long-term tolerability and efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: International, multicentre, open-label, 30-week extension study of two 24-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were ambulatory adults (59% female; mean age, 74.7 +/- 0.3) with a diagnosis of possible or probable VaD and without a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, who were medically stable and had completed one of two double-blind studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> 5 mg/day for the first 6 weeks, then 10 mg/day (clinician approval required) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Assessments were performed at week 6 and every 12 weeks thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measure was the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Safety/tolerability measures included adverse events (AEs) and physical and laboratory evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 1219 eligible patients, 885 (72.6%) were enrolled, of which 707 (79.9%) completed the study; 127 (14.4%) patients discontinued due to AEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A mean reduction (0.6-1.15 points) from double-blind study baseline score to week 54 (end of open-label study) on the ADAS-cog was observed for patients who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> continuously for 54 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ADAS-cog scores remained stable in the group that initiated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> treatment during the extension study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most common <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi>-related AEs were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> (occurring in 5.3%) and diarrhoea (8.8%); no unexpected AEs attributable to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> improves cognition for up to 54 weeks in patients with VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients initiating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> in this extension study did not perform as well on the primary outcome measure as those initiating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> in the double-blind study </plain></SENT>
