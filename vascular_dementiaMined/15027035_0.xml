<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects were taken from those enrolled in 'The Mild Project' a prospective study on the natural history of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (Mini Mental State Examination &gt; or = 18) and with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 129 subjects were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physical symptoms were assessed with a checklist investigating nine different body organs or apparati </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Physical symptoms were grouped into those referred to the head (Head Symptoms: ear and hearing; eyes and sight; and head and face) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the others (Body Symptoms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Geriatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale (GDS) and physical comorbidity with Greenfield's Index of Disease Severity (IDS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of patients reporting one or more Head Symptoms linearly increased with increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> severity (Mantel-Haenszel test = 6.497, df = 1, p = 0.011), while the number of patients reporting one or more Body Symptoms linearly increased with increasing physical comorbidity (Mantel-Haenszel test = 4.726, df = 1, p = 0.030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These associations were confirmed in multivariate logistic regression models with adjustment for potential confounders (age, gender, education, cognitive performance, daily function, and diagnosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Head Symptoms are specifically associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> while Body Symptoms with physical comorbidity, in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recognizing these associations in individual patients may help clinicians decide whether to initiate or continue antidepressant therapy or whether to carry out physical instrumental investigations </plain></SENT>
