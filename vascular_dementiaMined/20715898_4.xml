<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, research mainly focuses on neurogenesis occurring in the sub-ventricular zone and dentate gyrus, while the research of the piriform cortex (Pir) is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Few results showed that weak neurogenesis exists in the Pir of adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since neurogenesis occurs in the Pir and is closely related to cognitive function, this study addressed the question of whether neurogenesis occurs in the Pir of an animal with the VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE AND HYPOTHESIS: This study investigated the effects of hyperbaric oxygen therapy on brain blood supply and neurogenesis in the piriform cortex (Pir) of rats with VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: Compared to non-VD control rats (NC), rats with VD showed reduced rCBF, increased rCBV and slower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> in the Pir </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, following hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment in VD rats, rCBF increased, rCBV decreased and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the restoration in brain blood supply was associated with increased neurogenesis, immunohistochemical detection of nestin and doublecortin (DCX) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the Pir of both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and VD rats, nestin positive cells were localized to layer II (superficial cellular layer) and layer III (deep cellular layer) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nestin expression was increased in Pir cells in VD rats and was even more intensely expressed after the HBO treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DCX positive cells were mostly located in layer II from amygdaline fissure to rhinal fissure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that HBO therapy can improve the blood supply and promote the neurogenesis in the Pir of adult rats with the VD </plain></SENT>
