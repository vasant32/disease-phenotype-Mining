<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer type (DAT), 25 patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), and 12 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects were evaluated as to general cognition, visuoperception and emotion recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The score on the emotion recognition task significantly correlated with that of the Mini-Mental State Examination for VD patients while this was not the case for DAT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, VD patients performed significantly worse than DAT patients on the emotion recognition task in spite of the fact that there was no difference in the general cognitive and visuoperceptual abilities between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The result of this study coupled with the past studies led to the hypothesis that the relationship between intellectual deficits and the deterioration in recognizing emotions differs according to type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Caregivers in nursing homes and hospitals need to take into account their patients' intellectual deficits but also their deteriorating ability of identifying emotions </plain></SENT>
