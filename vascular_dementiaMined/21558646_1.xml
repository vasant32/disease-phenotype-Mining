<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data was derived from the 3C cohort study conducted in community-dwelling individuals aged 65 years and over, randomly recruited from electoral rolls of three French areas and followed up for four years (1999-2001 through 2004) with assessments every 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study sample comprised 7989 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-free individuals (mean age, 74.0 years; 61% women) assessed at baseline for current or past <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024517" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Major Depressive Episodes</z:e> (MDE) based on MDE module of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, self-reported lifetime treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and level of depressive symptoms using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fully adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were applied to examine the risk of incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> associated with these markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MDE and self-reported lifetime treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> did not increase incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, high level of depressive symptoms at baseline was associated with a 50% increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (adjusted Hazard Ratio [HR], 1.5; 95% Confidence interval [CI], 1.2-2.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This result was driven by a five-fold increased risk of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (HR, 4.8; 95% CI, 2.2-10.7; p &lt; 0.0001), whereas there was no increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (1.0; 0.7-1.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In elderly individuals, high level of depressive symptoms is predictive of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> within a few years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This close temporal association suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> is less a risk factor for than a prodromal symptom of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
