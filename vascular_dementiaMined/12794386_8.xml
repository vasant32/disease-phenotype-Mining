<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, a C/T polymorphism in the promoter region of the interleukin 1-alpha (IL-1alpha) gene (position -889) was reported to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the polymorphism of IL-1alpha was examined in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and nondemented controls in a Chinese population in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No difference was found in the IL-1alpha T allele frequency among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The predominant polymorphic allele ( approximately 90%) of IL-1alpha was the C allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The APOE4 allele was overrepresented in the AD cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of the APOE4 allele did not influence the IL-1alpha genotype or allele distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of the IL-1alpha T allele, in particular the homozygous form, was lower than in whites and may account for the lack of association between IL-1alpha C/T polymorphism and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> among Chinese in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of the heterozygous IL-1alpha T allele cannot be used for distinguishing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> from controls </plain></SENT>
