<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Simple, yet valid, assessment instruments are needed to quantitate the severity of cognitive and functional impairment in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients seen in consultation or studied in therapeutic trails </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among sixty-three patients with known ischemic cerebrovascular disease, we found thirteen who satisfied research criteria for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, nineteen who were "borderline" and thirty-one who were not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We administered the Cognitive Capacity Screening Examination and the Functional Activities Questionnaire to these patients and found both tests capable of distinguishing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> from nondemented groups with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This battery of assessment instruments was especially helpful in evaluating patients who fell into the "borderline" category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both tests can be easily administered at the bedside or during routine office visits </plain></SENT>
