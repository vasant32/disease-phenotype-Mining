<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current investigation examined the ability of impairment in these domains to differentiate AD from other overlapping conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In experiment 1, 14 AD patients, 21 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) patients, 11 frontal variant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (fvFTD) patients and 41 controls were administered a graded faces test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>VaD patients demonstrated a level of impairment comparable to the AD group on both the naming and person identification elements of the task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A mild naming deficit was revealed in the fvFTD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In experiment 2, 22 AD patients, 23 patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI), 11 fvFTD patients, 13 semantic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (SD) patients, and 23 elderly controls were administered the face-place test, a newly developed task that combines naming of famous faces, item recognition and spatial location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The naming component of the face-place test clearly differentiated SD patients from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patient groups, except those with fvFTD, showed substantial deficits in the item recognition and spatial components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consistency analyses indicated a fairly robust association between the two episodic components (item recognition and placing), but not between semantic and episodic elements of the FPT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Person knowledge deficits are, therefore, not specific to AD and the employment of face stimuli may influence the performance of SD patients on tasks of episodic memory </plain></SENT>
