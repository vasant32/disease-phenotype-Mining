<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 7 patients with AD, 6 with MD, and 9 with VaD underwent SPECT studies with N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-[(123)I] iodoamphetamine and (123)I-iomazenil to measure rCBF and rBZR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ratios of rCBF and rBZR uptake in brain subregions to the average global activity were compared among these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we acquired z-score maps using 3-dimensional stereotactic surface projections of SPECT data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with AD, VaD and MD showed rCBF and rBZR reduction predominantly in the frontal lobe, but rBZR images revealed more extensive and severe defects than rCBF images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, AD showed rCBF and rBZR reduction predominantly in the parietotemporal lobe compared with VaD and MD, but rCBF images revealed more extensive defects than rBZR images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: rCBF imaging can detect parietotemporal abnormalities in AD, while rBZR imaging may enable the demonstration of underlying pathophysiological differences in the frontal lobe between VaD, MD and AD, reflecting neuronal integrity in the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
