<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interaction between Aβ and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) has been implicated in <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> associated with this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pinocembrin, a <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoid</z:chebi> abundant in propolis, has been reported to possess numerous biological activities beneficial to health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our previous studies have demonstrated that pinocembrin has neuroprotective effects on ischemic and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It has been approved by the State Food and Drug Administration of China for clinical use in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Against this background, we investigated the effects of pinocembrin on cognitive function and neuronal protection against Aβ-induced toxicity and explored its potential mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mice received an intracerebroventricular fusion of Aβ25-35 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pinocembrin was administrated orally at 20 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day for 8 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Behavioral performance, cerebral cortex neuropil ultrastructure, <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> and RAGE expression were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further, a RAGE-overexpressing cell model and an AD cell model were used for investigating the mechanisms of pinocembrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying the efficacy of pinocembrin were conducted on target action, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function and potential signal transduction using fluorescence-based multiparametric technologies on a high-content analysis platform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our results showed that oral administration of pinocembrin improved cognitive function, preserved the ultrastructural neuropil and decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> of the cerebral cortex in Aβ25-35-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pinocembrin did not have a significant effect on inhibiting Aβ1-42 production and scavenging intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, pinocembrin significantly inhibited the upregulation of RAGE transcripts and protein expression both in vivo and in vitro, and also markedly depressed the activation of p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-MAPKAP kinase-2 (MK2)-heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) and stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-c-Jun pathways and the downstream nuclear factor κB (NFκB) <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> subsequent to Aβ-RAGE interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In addition, pinocembrin significantly alleviated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction through improving <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential and inhibiting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, and regulated mitochondrion-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by restoration of B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 2 (Bcl-2) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> and inactivation of caspase 3 and caspase 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pinocembrin was shown to infer cognitive improvement and neuronal protection in AD models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of action of the compound were illustrated on RAGE-dependent transduction inhibition and mitochondrion protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It appears to be a promising candidate for the prevention and therapy of AD </plain></SENT>
