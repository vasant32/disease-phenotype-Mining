<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The test battery was administrated to 38 healthy subjects, 69 schizophrenic patients, and 18 patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (10 probable Alzheimer-type and eight vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant decrease of performance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient groups compared to the healthy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the schizophrenic group, the test indicated a deterioration of functioning in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cognitive areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient group with Alzheimer-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> performed only slightly better than the schizophrenic group, because the fall of performance was not significant only one of the cognitive areas (in the visuo-spatial tasks) when compared to the healthy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between the performance of patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and that of healthy subjects in direct memory, verbal and visuo-spatial tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The test results indicated an even deterioration of cognitive areas in patients with Alzheimer-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As for the vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> group, the most vulnerable area proved to be that of attention, while their verbal functions were relatively spared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The deterioration in other cognitive functions shown by schizophrenic subjects was more moderate, but still significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A comparison of the RBANS scores of the schizophrenic patients in our study and the result of an American study was also carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The global indeces showed no difference; only the pattern of the sub-scales was a little different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Hungarian version of the RBANS seems approprite for the differentiation of healthy and deteriorated cognitive performance in a Hungarian patient population </plain></SENT>
