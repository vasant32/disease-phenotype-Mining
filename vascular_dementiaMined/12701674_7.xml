<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The role of allelic variation in APOE, the genetic locus for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E, in geriatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are conflicting reports as to an association between the epsilon4 allele and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in late life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Using a community based study of non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> elders in Cache County, Utah, that included many very old individuals, we examined the relationship between APOE and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> (age &gt; 60) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, with particular attention to possible age effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no overall association between APOE and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there was a significant interaction effect of APOE and age such that the relationship of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> with respect to presence of the epsilon4 allele was larger among those 80 and older compared with those below age 80 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistent with previous studies, women were more likely to experience <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> than men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Because we excluded prevalent cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, this pattern of relative risk with age may reflect the appearance of depressive symptoms as a prodrome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal studies should help to confirm or refute this explanation of the data </plain></SENT>
