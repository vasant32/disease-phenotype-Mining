<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been estimated that the cost to society for caring for AD patients will consume the entire gross national product of the U.S.A. by the middle of this century if left unabated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Until recently, the only available drugs for this condition were cholinergic treatments, which symptomatically enhance cognitive state to some degree, but they were not neuroprotective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In fact, many potential neuroprotective drugs tested in clinical trials failed because they were poorly tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, after our discovery of its clinically-tolerated mechanism of action, one neuroprotective drug, memantine, was recently approved by the European Union and the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recent phase 3 clinical trials have shown that memantine is effective in the treatment of moderate-to-severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and possibly vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Here we review the molecular mechanism of memantine's action and also the basis for the drug's use in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e>, which are mediated at least in part by excitotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Excitotoxicity is defined as excessive exposure to the neurotransmitter <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> or overstimulation of its membrane receptors, leading to neuronal injury or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Excitotoxic neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is mediated in part by overactivation of N-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-d-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>)-type <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptors, which results in excessive Ca(2+) influx through the receptor's associated ion channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Physiological <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor activity, however, is also essential for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neuronal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This means that potential neuroprotective agents that block virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor activity will very likely have unacceptable clinical side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For this reason many previous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> have disappointingly failed advanced clinical trials for a number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In contrast, studies in our laboratory have shown that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40519">adamantane</z:chebi> derivative, memantine, preferentially blocks excessive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor activity without disrupting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Memantine does this through its action as an uncompetitive, low-affinity, open-channel blocker; it enters the receptor-associated ion channel preferentially when it is excessively open, and, most importantly, its off-rate is relatively fast so that it does not substantially accumulate in the channel to interfere with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> synaptic transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Clinical use has corroborated the prediction that memantine is thus well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Besides <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, memantine is currently in trials for additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e>, including other forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>, and severe neuropathic pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A series of second-generation memantine derivatives are currently in development and may prove to have even greater neuroprotective properties than memantine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These second-generation drugs take advantage of the fact that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor has other modulatory sites in addition to its ion channel that potentially could also be used for safe but effective clinical intervention </plain></SENT>
