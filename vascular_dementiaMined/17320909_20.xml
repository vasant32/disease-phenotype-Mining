<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated capillary density in 12 subjects with leukoaraiosis (LA), in 9 age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, in 7 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), and 4 after whole-brain irradiation for <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the LA study (which as been published), autopsy brains were evaluated by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of LA was indicated by confluent or patchy areas of hyperintensity in the deep white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We employed a stereology method using computerized image processing and analysis to determine microvascular density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Afferent vessels (arterioles and capillaries, but not veins or venules) were stained for alkaline phosphatase in 100 microm thick celloidin sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microvascular density in LA lesions in the deep white matter (2.56%) was significantly lower than in the corresponding deep white matter of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (3.20%, p=0.0180) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LA subjects demonstrated decreased vascular density at early ages (55-65 years) when compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that LA affects the brain globally, with capillary loss, although the parenchymal damage is found primarily in the deep white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In ongoing studies of the deep white matter in AD brains, we found a pattern of decreased vascular density compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, as well as an age-related decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the four irradiated brains, we found very low vessel densities, similar to those found in LA, without an additional age-related decline </plain></SENT>
