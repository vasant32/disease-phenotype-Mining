<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: eZIS analysis of brain perfusion SPECT images was used in patients with early AD, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD + AD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo> (FTD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significant changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the volume of interest were assessed in the posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus and parietal cortices; the severity and extent of decreases in rCBF and the ratio of the extent of the decrease in rCBF to the decrease in whole-brain blood flow (rCBF ratio) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The severity of the decrease in rCBF in AD patients was significantly greater than in VD and FTD patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The extent of the decrease in rCBF in AD patients was significantly greater than in FTD patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rCBF ratio in AD patients was higher than in VD and FTD patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The eZIS indices, especially the rCBF ratio, may be useful in establishing the differential diagnosis between early-stage AD and FTD or VD, but the differentiation of AD from VD + AD or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e> remains difficult </plain></SENT>
