<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of the study was to assess some aspects of comorbidity in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed comorbidity differences according to age and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 311 patients older than 64 years old with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were prospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were collected on sociodemographic endpoints, type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, Barthel Index (BI), Lawton Index (LO), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Charlson Index, total number of drugs, history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> (HT), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (DM), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> (DL), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> (COPD) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sample consisted of 222 women (71.4%) and 89 men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean age (standard deviation [SD]) was 80.6 (6) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients were taking an average of 5.8 (2.6) drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean of Charlson Index was of 2.1 (1.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one percent had HT, 24% DM, 24% DL, 13% HF, 11% COPD and 8% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found better scores in the MMSE, higher comorbidity and percentage of married people and prevalence of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in men with respect to women, who had higher percentage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, and widowers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When differences were analyzed according to age, we found a higher percentage of widowers and HF diagnosis, a lower LI values and DL percentage in the patients older than 84 years with respect to younger subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed the presence of high comorbidity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> drugs prescription in elderly people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There are some differences in comorbidity according to age and gender that must be taken into account </plain></SENT>
