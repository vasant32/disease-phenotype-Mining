<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was performed on 240 diabetic patients aged 65 years or older who had no diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The MMSE scores were 28-30 (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range) in 151 patients (63%), 24-27 (suspected CI) in 77 (32%), and ≤ 23 (definite CI) in 12 (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 12 patients with MMSE scores ≤ 23 underwent further detailed examination: the final diagnosis was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) (N = 5), vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (N = 2), and mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (N = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 24 of the 77 patients with MMSE scores of 24-27 who were referred for further detailed examination, the final diagnosis was early AD (N = 5), cerebrovascular disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) (N = 10), and mild CI (N = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only 2 of the patients were judged as being <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of patients with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, the rate of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretic</z:chebi> use, and the serum levels of non-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> were higher, and the percentage of patients with a history of habitual alcohol consumption was lower in the low MMSE score group than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MMSE score group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among elderly diabetic patients aged 65 years or older, 5% had evident CI and 32% had suspected CI </plain></SENT>
