<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Necropsy confirmed clinical diagnostic accuracy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> is claimed to exceed 90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This figure contains two fallacies; it includes cases in which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> exists with other diseases affecting cognition and the studies that report these figures excluded cases without necropsy (verification bias) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of these errors is estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were taken from the University of Western Ontario <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Study, a registry of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases with clinical and psychometric follow up to necropsy based in a university <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025261" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory disorders</z:e> clinic with secondary and tertiary referrals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were available on 307 patients; 200 (65%) had clinically diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 12 (4%) vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 47 (15%) mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 48 (16%) had other diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred and ninety two of 307 cases (63%) died and 122 of 192 fatalities (64%) had necropsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pathological material was interpreted in two ways, allowing and disallowing coexistent disease in making a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In cases without necropsy, progressive cognitive loss was used as a marker for degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The outcome measures of interest were the positive predictive value of a clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> allowing and disallowing coexistent diseases and with and without correction for cases that were not necropsied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The clinical diagnoses differed significantly between the population who died and those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In cases without necropsy, 22% had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> on follow up, concentrated in early cases and men, showing considerable scope for verification bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value of a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> was 81% including coexistent diseases, falling to 44% when limited to pure cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Combined, these factors reduce the positive predictive value to 38% for pure <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Correction for dual pathology and verification bias halves the positive predictive value of the clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Data derived from necropsy studies cannot be extrapolated to the whole population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This has important implications including uncertainty about diagnosis and prognosis and a dilution effect in therapeutic trials in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
