<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Vitamin B(12) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> represent modifiable risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They may increase the risk of Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) as their deficiency can increase the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level due to slowed methylation reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Homocysteine</z:chebi> has a neurotoxic effect that could lead to neurologic disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hence, it is important to explore the status of serum B(12) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> in AD and VaD to evolve the treatment strategies for the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: A retrospective study was conducted to assess the levels of vitamin B(12), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in serum and the relationship of these factors, including age and sex to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in VaD, AD, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> due to other causes (DOC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum vitamin B(12), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, TSH, and total cholesterol were studied in 32 AD patients (mean age: 65 years), 12 VaD patients (mean age: 61 years), 83 DOC (mean age: 65 years), and 127 control subjects (mean age: 49 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In AD, VaD, and DOC, the levels of vitamin B(12) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> were significantly lower (P &lt; 0.002; 0.026; 0.002 for vitamin B(12) and P &lt; 0.000 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 3 groups for <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>) as compared with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, TSH levels were significantly lower in AD and DOC (P &lt; 0.008; 0.038) as compared with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Vitamin B(12) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> were significantly low in both AD and VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hence, B vitamin supplementation should be considered as possible targets for the therapeutic intervention in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
