<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN We studied the GH response to GHRH in controls and in AD and VD patients and correlated their responses with somatostatin cerebrospinal levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Twelve control subjects and 56 patients, 28 with AD and 28 with VD, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A GHRH test was performed in every case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred mcg of GHRH was administered as a intravenous bolus and blood samples were drawn at -15, 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained after lumbar puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measurements of GH and somatostatin were determined by specific radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The GH response to GHRH exhibited no difference between AD and VD patients (12.2 +/- 2 mcg/l vs 9.9 +/- 1.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 17 AD patients and 16 VD patients with exaggerated GH response to GHRH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between cerebrospinal levels of somatostatin (30 +/- 2.1 pg/mL in AD patients vs 42 +/- 2.4 in VD patients), and there was no correlation among GH response to GHRH and cerebrospinal levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our study we observed no difference between the AD and VD patients in GH response to GHRH and no difference in somatostatin cerebrospinal levels in these patients </plain></SENT>
