<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and twenty cases of VD were randomly divided into 2 groups, 60 cases in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The observation group were treated with puncturing with needles in alignment at the hairline region and the control group with oral administration of Duxil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hasegawa's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> scale (HDS), mini-mental state examination (MMSE), functional activity questionnaire (FAQ), nerve function defect (NFD) and main symptoms (MS) scales were used for assessment of symptoms and signs before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Changes of scores for HDS, MMSE, FAQ, NFD and MS before and after treatment had statistically very significant differences (P &lt; 0.01) in the two groups, with significant difference between the two groups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total effective rate was 88.33% in the observation group and 81.67% in the control group with a significant difference between the two groups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Puncturing with needles in alignment at the hairline region has definite therapeutic effect on vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
