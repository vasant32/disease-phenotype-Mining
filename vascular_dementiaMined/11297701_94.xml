<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> shortens life expectancy; estimates of median survival after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> have ranged from 5 to 9.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies of people with existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, however, may have underestimated the deleterious effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> on survival by failing to consider persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapidly progressive</z:hpo> illness who died before they could be included in a study (referred to as length bias) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used data from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging to estimate survival from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; the estimate was adjusted for length bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A random sample of 10,263 subjects 65 years old or older from throughout Canada was screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, we ascertained the date of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and conducted follow-up for five years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We analyzed data on 821 subjects, of whom 396 had probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 252 had possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, and 173 had vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the group as a whole, the unadjusted median survival was 6.6 years (95 percent confidence interval, 6.2 to 7.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for length bias, the estimated median survival was 3.3 years (95 percent confidence interval, 2.7 to 4.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median survival was 3.1 years for subjects with probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, 3.5 years for subjects with possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, and 3.3 years for subjects with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Median survival after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is much shorter than has previously been estimated </plain></SENT>
