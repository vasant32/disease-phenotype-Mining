<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Measures were obtained in nine AD, eight SIVD, and 11 control subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging segmentation software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Statistically significantly lower N-acetylaspartate/<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi>-containing metabolites (Cho) and higher Cho/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi>-containing metabolites in posterior mesial gray matter in AD versus control subjects were independent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imagining differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Combined measures allowed correct classification of AD and control subjects, but none of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> measures allowed accurate discrimination between AD and SIVD subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Between-group differences in tissue-type contributions to H-1 MR spectroscopic imaging voxels must be accounted for when reporting H-1 MR spectroscopic imaging data in AD, SIVD, and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combined studies allowed more accurate discrimination between AD and control subjects than either study alone </plain></SENT>
