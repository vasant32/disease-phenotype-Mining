<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants underwent clinical and neuropsychological evaluation and lumbar puncture at baseline and after 2 years at a university hospital memory clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CSF was analyzed for total tau (T-tau), phospho-tau(181) (P-tau(181)) and amyloid-beta(1-42) (Abeta(1-42)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the 2-year observational time, 12 MCI patients progressed to AD and 3 progressed to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, while 68 remained stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline T-tau and P-tau(181) levels were elevated in the MCI-AD group as compared to the stable MCI patients and the control group (p&lt;0.01), while baseline Abeta(1-42) levels were lower (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stable MCI patients were biochemically indistinguishable from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The biomarker levels at baseline and after 2 years showed Pearson R values between 0.81 and 0.91 (p&lt;0.001) and coefficients of variation of 7.2 to 8.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, intra-individual biomarker levels are remarkably stable over 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, even minor biochemical changes induced by treatment against AD should be detectable using these biomarkers, which bodes well for their usefulness as surrogate markers for drug efficacy in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
