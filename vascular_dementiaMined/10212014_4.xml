<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared patterns of drug use among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) to examine their relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a population-based data set with over 350,000 residents admitted between 1992 and 1995 to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Medicare-Medicaid-certified nursing homes in five states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After excluding patients with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mental disorders</z:e> or retardation, we identified 23,073 patients age 65 years and over with a diagnosis of AD and 76,087 with VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined over 350 resident data items (demographic, diagnostic, clinical, treatment) collected with the federally mandated Minimum Data Set, drug data (brand name, dosage, route and frequency of administration for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> drugs), and Medicare hospital claims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cognitive status was measured with a 7-point cognitive performance scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Estimates of drug use were adjusted for age, gender, race, and prevalence of respective disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with AD were younger and had more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> than those with VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The latter had more comorbid clinical conditions (3.1 +/- 1.9 vs 2.3 +/- 1.7 for patients with AD) and received a greater number of total drugs (6.1 +/- 4.6 vs 5.3 +/- 4.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall use of cardiovascular, anti-Parkinson, pulmonary, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi>, and nutritional agents was less frequent among patients with AD than those with VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results were consistent across different levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, patients with AD have fewer associated diseases and appear to be less intensively medically treated </plain></SENT>
