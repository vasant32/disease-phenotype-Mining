<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 72 SD rats were randomized into control (n=16), sham-operation (n=16), model (n=20) and EA pretreatment (n=20) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>VD model was established by modified middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EA (1 mA, 1.7 Hz) was applied to "Baihui" (GV 20), "Shenshu"(<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> 23) and "Zusanli" (ST 36), once daily for 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Glu content of right hippocampus tissue was detected with chromatometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NMDAR 1 mRNA expression of hippocampus was detected by in situ hybridization histochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In comparison with sham operation group, Glu content and NMDAR 1 mRNA expression of hippocampus in model group increased significantly (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with model group, Glu content and NMDAR 1 mRNA expression of hippocampus in EA pretreatment group decreased significantly (P&lt;0.01, 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EA pretreatment can suppress the increase of Glu content, down-regulate NMDAR 1 mRNA expression in VD rats, which may contribute to its effect in relieving VD via reducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and protecting cerebral neurons </plain></SENT>
