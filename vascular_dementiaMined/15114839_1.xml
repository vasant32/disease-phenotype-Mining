<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 2,386 patients aged over 65 years (702 men and 1,684 women) who were recognized as in need of care between 21st October 1999 and 27th April 2000 were followed up with a multivariate logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dependent variable was life/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> during the 2 years after recognition, and independent variables were sex, age, present address, the initial level of care needed, and care-requiring disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The same analysis was also applied to the 1,549 (440 mean and 1,109 women) who were still alive 2 years after recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dependent variable was whether the level of care had deteriorated, and independent variables were the same as previously employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When the odds ratio of survival was set at 1.0 for the male patients aged over 65 years, that for the females was 1.995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the odds ratio was set at 1.0 for the patients aged 65-69 years, that for those aged 85 years and over was 0.593 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the odds ratio was set at 1.0 for the patients in need of long-term support, that for those in level 2 was 0.458, that in level 3 was 0.326, that in level 4 was 0.257, and that in level 5 was 0.154, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the odds ratios among the care-requiring disorders and present addresses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When the odds ratio for deterioration in the level of care was set at 1.0 for the patients aged 65-69 years who survived 2 years after recognition, that for those aged 80-84 years was 1.820, and that for those aged 85 years and over was 1.983 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When the odds ratio was set at 1.0 for the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, the values were 0.482 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of unknown etiology, 0.110 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, 0.415 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, 0.431 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, 0.240 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026857" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">musculoskeletal diseases</z:e>, and 0.359 for miscellaneous diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the odds ratios between sexes, among the initial levels of care, and among present addresses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present 2 year cohort study of odds ratios of survival and deterioration in the level of care for the patients aged over 65 years revealed the survival of female patients to be twice that for males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio of deterioration was higher for the patients aged 80-84 years and 85 years and over than those aged 65-69 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The higher the initial level of care, the lower the survival odds ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio of survival was lower for those aged 85 years and over than for those aged 65-69 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the numbers of the elderly long-term care patients do not increase at the same rate as the numbers of the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio of deterioration was lower for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diseases except vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> than those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>If reduction of the odds ratio of deterioration for the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diseases except <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> can be achieved by provision of sufficient services covered by public nursing-care insurance, such an approach should be stressed to prevent increase in the needs for long-term nursing-care </plain></SENT>
