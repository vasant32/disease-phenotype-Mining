<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine plasma levels of Abeta <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) as predictors of incident AD and other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, population-based cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: The Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Plasma Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) levels were analyzed as predictors of incident AD in 1045 men at age 70 years and 680 men at age 77 years using Cox proportional hazards analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> and other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were diagnosed by standardized screening, clinical evaluation, and medical record review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hazard ratios of AD (primary outcome) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (secondary outcomes) according to baseline levels of plasma Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From the age of 77 years at baseline, 46 individuals developed AD at follow-up (median, 5.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A low plasma Abeta(40) level at age 77 years was associated with higher incidence of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio was 4.87 (95% confidence interval, 1.63-14.6) for the lowest Abeta(40) tertile compared with the highest tertile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On follow-up from age 70 years at baseline (median, 11.2 years), 82 individuals developed AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Plasma Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) levels measured at age 70 years were not significantly associated with incident AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low plasma Abeta(40) levels predicted incident AD in elderly men independently of potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Plasma Abeta(42) levels were not significantly associated with AD incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The clinical value of Abeta measurement in plasma remains to be established in future studies </plain></SENT>
