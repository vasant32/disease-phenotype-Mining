<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since TNF-alpha is known to cause the degeneration of myelin, we examined whether these lesions can be ameliorated by ibudilast, a cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor that suppresses <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-alpha production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After the ligation of both common carotid arteries in 29 rats, 21 rats received a daily oral administration of 10, 30 or 60 mg/kg ibudilast and 8 rats received vehicle for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pathological changes in the white matter were quantified in terms of white matter lesions and the emergence of activated microglia immunoreactive for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the vehicle-treated animals, white matter lesions and microglial activation occurred in the optic tract, internal capsule and corpus callosum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A low dose (10 mg/kg) of ibudilast failed to suppress the white matter lesions and microglial activation, whereas a dose of either 30 or 60 mg/kg ibudilast ameliorated these lesions (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Without an alterations in laboratory blood data, 60 mg/kg ibudilast exhibited percent reduction of the white matter lesions ranging between 50% and 70%, which was more effective than 30 mg/kg ibudilast (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The TNF-alpha immunoreactive glia decreased in number in the 60 mg/kg ibudilast-treated group as compared to the vehicle-treated group (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate a dose-dependent protective effect of ibudilast against cerebrovascular white matter lesions and suggest a potential use for ibudilast in the treatment of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
