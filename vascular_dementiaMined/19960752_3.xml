<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several randomized controlled trials of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37733">cholinesterase inhibitors</z:chebi> and memantine in mild to moderate vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> have demonstrated the efficacy of these treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, given these drugs incur considerable cost, the economic argument for their use is less clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37733">cholinesterase inhibitors</z:chebi> and memantine for mild to moderate vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A decision analysis model using a 24-28 week time horizon was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcomes of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37733">cholinesterase inhibitors</z:chebi> and memantine and probabilities of adverse events were extracted from a systematic review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Costs of adverse events, medications, and physician visits were obtained from local estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Robustness was tested with probabilistic sensitivity analysis using a Monte Carlo simulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">Donepezil</z:chebi> 5 mg daily, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> 10 mg daily, galantamine 16-24 mg daily, rivastigmine flexible dosing up to 6 mg twice daily, or memantine 10 mg twice daily versus standard care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) expressed as cost per unit decrease in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Assessment Scale-cognitive (ADAS-cog) subscale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">Donepezil</z:chebi> 10 mg daily was found to be the most cost-effective treatment with an ICER of $400.64 (95%CI, $281.10-$596.35) per unit decline in the ADAS-cog subscale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other treatments were dominated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> 10 mg, that is, more costly and less effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: From a societal perspective, treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37733">cholinesterase inhibitors</z:chebi> or memantine was more effective but also more costly than standard care for mild to moderate vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> 10 mg strategy was the most cost-effective and also dominated the other alternatives </plain></SENT>
