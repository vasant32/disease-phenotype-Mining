<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This paper proposes that there is an underlying vascular pathophysiology behind these conditions, which is related to the strength of the pulse waves induced in the craniospinal cavity by the arterial vascular tree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is proposed the manifestation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in any one patient is dependant on the way that the pulsations interact with the brain and its venous and perivascular drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This interaction is predominately dependant on the compliance of the craniospinal cavity and the chronicity of the increased pulse wave stress </plain></SENT>
