<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects consisted of 69 patients with AD and 60 patients with non-AD, including vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002145'>frontotemporal dementia</z:hpo>, other dementing diseases and neuropsychiatric diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Standard transaxial section and 3D-SSP SPECT images with N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-[123I] iodoamphetamine were blindly interpreted by three examiners and were classified into the following three patterns: typical AD, atypical AD, and not indicative AD patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 3D-SSP images demonstrated reductions of cerebral blood flow in the parieto-temporal association cortex and posterior cingulate gyrus more clearly and easily than the standard transaxial images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 93% and 85% with 3D-SSP and 83% and 82% with standard transaxial section respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3D-SSP was especially useful for early or atypical AD which showed no characteristic perfusion abnormalities on standard transaxial images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that SPECT with 3D-SSP provides an sensitive as well as accurate tool for the diagnosis of AD </plain></SENT>
