<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They consisted of cases of lacunar, atherothrombotic, cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of each <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> category was based on both computed tomographic (CT) and clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In particular, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> was diagnosed by the diagnostic criteria proposed by Bennett et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood was withdrawn simultaneously from the internal jugular vein (A) and the antecubital vein (B) followed by determination of the BTG-A level and the BTG-B level, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The BTG levels of 184 paired blood samples, thus, were obtained and the ratio (delta BTG) of BTG-A/BTG-B was calculated as an indicator for platelet activation in the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to the timing of the examination, these values of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase less than 7 days after the event were separated from those of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase more than 28 days after the event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The delta BTG levels were also determined in 25 of controls with diseases other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and considered to reflect platelet activation in the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean delta BTG values of each <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> treatment, compared with those of controls (0.96 +/- 0.42), were significantly higher except those during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase of cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and pronounced variability of delta BTG was noted in most subtypes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
