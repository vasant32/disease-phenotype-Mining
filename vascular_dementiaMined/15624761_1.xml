<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previously, alterations in neuronal metabolism were found in a number of brain areas of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we aimed at determining for the first time whether metabolic changes would also occur in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) patients in the supraoptic (SON), infundibular (INF), tuberomamillary (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TMN</z:e>), medial mamillary nuclei, vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca (VDB), and nucleus basalis of Meynert </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Golgi complex (GC) size, cell size, and vasopressin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels (in the SON) were used as measures of neuronal metabolic activity in postmortem material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The GC immunoreactivity was clearly diminished in the SON, INF and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TMN</z:e> and was increased in the VDB of VD cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in the SON and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TMN</z:e>, a decrease in the GC size was more pronounced in male than in female VD patients in accordance with the higher prevalence of VD in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 7 of 11 VD cases, vasopressin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were significantly reduced which may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo>, one of the most common clinical symptoms in VD, and to the lower blood pressure values that are often registered at the later stages of the VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TMN</z:e> is the sole source of cerebral <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi>, our data suggest deficient histaminergic transmission in the brain in VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diminished neuronal metabolism in the SON and INF was not observed in AD in this and previous studies, whereas the changes in the VDB and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TMN</z:e> are similar in VD and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the present study we thus found decreased metabolic activity in several hypothalamic nuclei in VD indicating diminished production of certain hormones and <z:chebi fb="65" ids="25512">neurotransmitters</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
