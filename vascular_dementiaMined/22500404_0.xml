<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe the expression levels of hippocampal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (flt-1), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and basic fibroblast growth factor receptor (bFGF-r) in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD) rats, thus studying the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> mechanism of moxibustion in VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty male elderly Wistar rats were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The VD rat model was prepared by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The model rats were divided into 3 groups by the random digit table, i. e., the moxibustion group, the Western medicine group, and the model group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A sham-operation control group was also set up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the moxibustion group rats was acupunctured at Baihui (GV20), Shenting (GV14), and Dazhui (GV24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="47943">Aniracetam</z:chebi> was given to rats in the Western medicine group by gastrogavage for 2 therapeutic courses, 15 days as one course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The learning and memory results were observed by the neuroethological score in combination of step-down avoidance test before treatment and by the end of the 2nd course respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of hippocampal VEGF, flt-1, bFGF, and bFGF-r of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats were detected using immunohistochemical assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 2 courses of treatment, statistical difference existed in the latent period, the error times, and the neuroethological score in the moxibustion group and the Western medicine group when compared with the model group (P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Statistical difference existed in the latent period and the neuroethological score between the moxibustion group and the Western medicine group (P &lt; 0.05), which indicated that moxibustion and Western medicine showed significant effects in improving the latent period, decreasing the error times and the neuroethological score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Better results were obtained in the moxibustion group than in the Western medicine group (P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Statistical difference of the average grey level (AGL) of hippocampal VEGF, flt-1, and bFGF existed in the moxibustion group and the Western medicine group when compared with the model group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Statistical difference of the bFGF-r expression existed only between the moxibustion group and the model group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Statistical difference of the VEGF and flt-1 expressions existed between the moxibustion group and the Western medicine group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Moxibustion showed confirmative effects in improving the behavioral score and memory performance in VD rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Its mechanisms might lie in that moxibustion regulated and controlled the expression levels of hippocampal VEGF, flt-1, bFGF, and bFGF-r in VD rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Particularly it up-regulated the expression levels of key factors VEGF and flt-1, promoted the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in the vital parts, and ultimately stimulated the repairing mechanisms of cerebral nerve injury </plain></SENT>
