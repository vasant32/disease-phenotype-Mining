<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Out of 250 clinical charts, 78 were selected of patients over 60 years old, who showed no signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Information was obtained regarding demographics, clinical conditions (diagnosis according to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10), complementary investigation, cognitive functions (via CAMCOG), neuroimaging, and the presence of risk factors for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> was the most prevalent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychiatric disorder</z:e> (74%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A great majority of the patients (86%) had at least one risk factor for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One-third of the sample showed three or more risk factors for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical conditions related to risk factors for VaD were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (48.7%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> (30.8%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> (25.6%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (23.1%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (12.8%), tryglyceride (12.8%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (5.1%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Definite risk factors for VaD were found in 83.3% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Previous interventions targeting risk factors were found in only 20% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The high rates of risk factors for VaD identified in this sample suggest that psychiatrists should be more attentive to these factors for the prevention of VaD </plain></SENT>
