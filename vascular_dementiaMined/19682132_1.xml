<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data on VA and Medicare use were obtained from VA administrative datasets and Medicare claims (1998-2001) for 2,137 male veterans who, in 1997, used some VA services, had a formal diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the VA, and were aged 65 and older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Generalized ordered logit models were used to estimate the effects of patient characteristics on use group over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 1998, 41.7% of the sample were VA-only users, 55.4% were dual users, and 2.9% were Medicare-only users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By 2001, 30.4% were VA-only users, 51.5% were dual users, and 18.1% were Medicare-only users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate results show that greater likelihood of Medicare use was associated with older age, being white, being married, having higher education, having private insurance or Medicaid, having low VA priority level, and living in a nursing home or dying during the year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher comorbidities were associated with greater likelihood of dual use as opposed to any single system use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, number of functional limitations was associated with greater likelihood of Medicare-only use and less likelihood of VA-only use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results imply that different aspects of veterans' needs have differential effects on where they seek care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Efforts to coordinate care between VA and Medicare providers are necessary to ensure that patients receive high-quality care, especially patients with multiple comorbidities </plain></SENT>
