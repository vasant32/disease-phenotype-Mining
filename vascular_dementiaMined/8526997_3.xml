<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied changes in the concentrations of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28683">kynurenine</z:chebi>, and other indoleamines in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (ATD) and those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger</z:e> type vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VDBT), and changes in these indoleamine concentrations 2 weeks after administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> uptake inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.005) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28683">kynurenine</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.005) were significantly decreased in ATD patients in comparison to those of the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> administration, there was a remarkable increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> concentration (249%, p &lt; 0.0001) and a significant decrease in 5-HIAA concentration (22%, p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the VDBT patients, only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> showed a significant decrease (p &lt; 0.005) in comparison to the control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It also increased significantly (214%) after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>/tryptophan and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28683">kynurenine</z:chebi>/tryptophan ratios were not correlated for the controls, but did significantly for the ATD and VDBT patients; after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> treatment, the increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>/tryptophan was correlated significantly with that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28683">kynurenine</z:chebi>/tryptophan for ATD, but not for VDBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that both the <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28683">kynurenine</z:chebi> pathways are impaired in ATD; whereas, the <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> pathway alone is in VDBT, and that these impairments are ameliorated by the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
