<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Since few studies have examined the effectiveness of therapies for subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, treatment guidelines are not available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current patterns in the treatment of such <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> have not been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the practice patterns of Canadian specialists for the treatment of subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and to survey their opinions regarding issues which are important in the design of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in this field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: National survey of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> specialists certified in Neurology or Geriatric Medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of responding physicians (78%) prescribed antithrombotic therapy for patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most begin treatment with aspirin 325 mg daily (64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The next three most common initial treatments were; no pharmacotherapy (12%), aspirin 650 mg daily (11%), and aspirin 1300 mg daily (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> continued to progress despite initial therapy, the treatment options were more varied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most specialists (69%) believed that an RCT to assess the efficacy of aspirin in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority (69%) also felt that serial neuroimaging would be required for participants in such a trial, with magnetic resonance imaging being cited most frequently (41%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The majority of specialists considered three years as the minimum duration for such a trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Specialist physician practice patterns vary significantly for the treatment of patients with subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most physicians believe that an RCT testing the efficacy of aspirin in this condition is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, before such a trial can be conducted, many methodological difficulties need to be addressed </plain></SENT>
